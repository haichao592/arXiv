          "description": "Data augmentation has recently seen increased interest in NLP due to more\nwork in low-resource domains, new tasks, and the popularity of large-scale\nneural networks that require large amounts of training data. Despite this\nrecent upsurge, this area is still relatively underexplored, perhaps due to the\nchallenges posed by the discrete nature of language data. In this paper, we\npresent a comprehensive and unifying survey of data augmentation for NLP by\nsummarizing the literature in a structured manner. We first introduce and\nmotivate data augmentation for NLP, and then discuss major methodologically\nrepresentative approaches. Next, we highlight techniques that are used for\npopular NLP applications and tasks. We conclude by outlining current challenges\nand directions for future research. Overall, our paper aims to clarify the\nlandscape of existing literature in data augmentation for NLP and motivate\nadditional work in this area. We also present a GitHub repository with a paper\nlist that will be continuously updated at\nhttps://github.com/styfeng/DataAug4NLP",

          "description": "The problem of knowledge-based visual question answering involves answering\nquestions that require external knowledge in addition to the content of the\nimage. Such knowledge typically comes in a variety of forms, including visual,\ntextual, and commonsense knowledge. The use of more knowledge sources, however,\nalso increases the chance of retrieving more irrelevant or noisy facts, making\nit difficult to comprehend the facts and find the answer. To address this\nchallenge, we propose Multi-modal Answer Validation using External knowledge\n(MAVEx), where the idea is to validate a set of promising answer candidates\nbased on answer-specific knowledge retrieval. This is in contrast to existing\napproaches that search for the answer in a vast collection of often irrelevant\nfacts. Our approach aims to learn which knowledge source should be trusted for\neach answer candidate and how to validate the candidate using that source. We\nconsider a multi-modal setting, relying on both textual and visual knowledge\nresources, including images searched using Google, sentences from Wikipedia\narticles, and concepts from ConceptNet. Our experiments with OK-VQA, a\nchallenging knowledge-based VQA dataset, demonstrate that MAVEx achieves new\nstate-of-the-art results.",

          "description": "Context-aware machine translation models are designed to leverage contextual\ninformation, but often fail to do so. As a result, they inaccurately\ndisambiguate pronouns and polysemous words that require context for resolution.\nIn this paper, we ask several questions: What contexts do human translators use\nto resolve ambiguous words? Are models paying large amounts of attention to the\nsame context? What if we explicitly train them to do so? To answer these\nquestions, we introduce SCAT (Supporting Context for Ambiguous Translations), a\nnew English-French dataset comprising supporting context words for 14K\ntranslations that professional translators found useful for pronoun\ndisambiguation. Using SCAT, we perform an in-depth analysis of the context used\nto disambiguate, examining positional and lexical characteristics of the\nsupporting words. Furthermore, we measure the degree of alignment between the\nmodel's attention scores and the supporting context from SCAT, and apply a\nguided attention strategy to encourage agreement between the two.",

          "description": "Persona can function as the prior knowledge for maintaining the consistency\nof dialogue systems. Most of previous studies adopted the self persona in\ndialogue whose response was about to be selected from a set of candidates or\ndirectly generated, but few have noticed the role of partner in dialogue. This\npaper makes an attempt to thoroughly explore the impact of utilizing personas\nthat describe either self or partner speakers on the task of response selection\nin retrieval-based chatbots. Four persona fusion strategies are designed, which\nassume personas interact with contexts or responses in different ways. These\nstrategies are implemented into three representative models for response\nselection, which are based on the Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder (HRE),\nInteractive Matching Network (IMN) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations\nfrom Transformers (BERT) respectively. Empirical studies on the Persona-Chat\ndataset show that the partner personas neglected in previous studies can\nimprove the accuracy of response selection in the IMN- and BERT-based models.\nBesides, our BERT-based model implemented with the context-response-aware\npersona fusion strategy outperforms previous methods by margins larger than\n2.7% on original personas and 4.6% on revised personas in terms of hits@1\n(top-1 accuracy), achieving a new state-of-the-art performance on the\nPersona-Chat dataset.",

          "description": "Automated unit test case generation tools facilitate test-driven development\nand support developers by suggesting tests intended to identify flaws in their\ncode. Existing approaches are usually guided by the test coverage criteria,\ngenerating synthetic test cases that are often difficult for developers to read\nor understand. In this paper we propose AthenaTest, an approach that aims to\ngenerate unit test cases by learning from real-world focal methods and\ndeveloper-written testcases. We formulate unit test case generation as a\nsequence-to-sequence learning task, adopting a two-step training procedure\nconsisting of denoising pretraining on a large unsupervised Java corpus, and\nsupervised finetuning for a downstream translation task of generating unit\ntests. We investigate the impact of natural language and source code\npretraining, as well as the focal context information surrounding the focal\nmethod. Both techniques provide improvements in terms of validation loss, with\npretraining yielding 25% relative improvement and focal context providing\nadditional 11.1% improvement. We also introduce Methods2Test, the largest\npublicly available supervised parallel corpus of unit test case methods and\ncorresponding focal methods in Java, which comprises 780K test cases mined from\n91K open-source repositories from GitHub. We evaluate AthenaTest on five\ndefects4j projects, generating 25K passing test cases covering 43.7% of the\nfocal methods with only 30 attempts. We execute the test cases, collect test\ncoverage information, and compare them with test cases generated by EvoSuite\nand GPT-3, finding that our approach outperforms GPT-3 and has comparable\ncoverage w.r.t. EvoSuite. Finally, we survey professional developers on their\npreference in terms of readability, understandability, and testing\neffectiveness of the generated tests, showing overwhelmingly preference towards\nAthenaTest.",

          "description": "Contemporary approaches to perception, planning, estimation, and control have\nallowed robots to operate robustly as our remote surrogates in uncertain,\nunstructured environments. There is now an opportunity for robots to operate\nnot only in isolation, but also with and alongside humans in our complex\nenvironments. Natural language provides an efficient and flexible medium\nthrough which humans can communicate with collaborative robots. Through\nsignificant progress in statistical methods for natural language understanding,\nrobots are now able to interpret a diverse array of free-form navigation,\nmanipulation, and mobile manipulation commands. However, most contemporary\napproaches require a detailed prior spatial-semantic map of the robot's\nenvironment that models the space of possible referents of the utterance.\nConsequently, these methods fail when robots are deployed in new, previously\nunknown, or partially observed environments, particularly when mental models of\nthe environment differ between the human operator and the robot. This paper\nprovides a comprehensive description of a novel learning framework that allows\nfield and service robots to interpret and correctly execute natural language\ninstructions in a priori unknown, unstructured environments. Integral to our\napproach is its use of language as a \"sensor\" -- inferring spatial,\ntopological, and semantic information implicit in natural language utterances\nand then exploiting this information to learn a distribution over a latent\nenvironment model. We incorporate this distribution in a probabilistic language\ngrounding model and infer a distribution over a symbolic representation of the\nrobot's action space. We use imitation learning to identify a belief space\npolicy that reasons over the environment and behavior distributions. We\nevaluate our framework through a variety of different navigation and mobile\nmanipulation experiments.",

          "description": "We consider the problem of using observational data to estimate the causal\neffects of linguistic properties. For example, does writing a complaint\npolitely lead to a faster response time? How much will a positive product\nreview increase sales? This paper addresses two technical challenges related to\nthe problem before developing a practical method. First, we formalize the\ncausal quantity of interest as the effect of a writer's intent, and establish\nthe assumptions necessary to identify this from observational data. Second, in\npractice, we only have access to noisy proxies for the linguistic properties of\ninterest -- e.g., predictions from classifiers and lexicons. We propose an\nestimator for this setting and prove that its bias is bounded when we perform\nan adjustment for the text. Based on these results, we introduce TextCause, an\nalgorithm for estimating causal effects of linguistic properties. The method\nleverages (1) distant supervision to improve the quality of noisy proxies, and\n(2) a pre-trained language model (BERT) to adjust for the text. We show that\nthe proposed method outperforms related approaches when estimating the effect\nof Amazon review sentiment on semi-simulated sales figures.

The resurgence of deep learning has greatly\nadvanced this field by neural generation models, especially the paradigm of\npretrained language models (PLMs). In this paper, we present an overview of the\nmajor advances achieved in the topic of PLMs for text generation. As the\npreliminaries, we present the general task definition and briefly describe the\nmainstream architectures of PLMs for text generation. As the core content, we\ndiscuss how to adapt existing PLMs to model different input data and satisfy\nspecial properties in the generated text. We further summarize several\nimportant fine-tuning strategies for text generation. Finally, we present\nseveral future directions and conclude this paper.

Like word embeddings, sentence embeddings are\ntypically learned on large text corpora and then transferred to various\ndownstream tasks, such as clustering and retrieval. Unlike word embeddings, the\nhighest performing solutions for learning sentence embeddings require labelled\ndata, limiting their usefulness to languages and domains where labelled data is\nabundant. In this paper, we present DeCLUTR: Deep Contrastive Learning for\nUnsupervised Textual Representations. Inspired by recent advances in deep\nmetric learning (DML), we carefully design a self-supervised objective for\nlearning universal sentence embeddings that does not require labelled training\ndata. When used to extend the pretraining of transformer-based language models,\nour approach closes the performance gap between unsupervised and supervised\npretraining for universal sentence encoders. Importantly, our experiments\nsuggest that the quality of the learned embeddings scale with both the number\nof trainable parameters and the amount of unlabelled training data, making\nfurther improvements straightforward. Our code and pretrained models are\npublicly available and can be easily adapted to new domains or used to embed\nunseen text.",

Probes are often designed\nfor simplicity, which has led to restrictions on probe design that may not\nallow for the full exploitation of the structure of encoded information; one\nsuch restriction is linearity. We examine the case of a structural probe\n(Hewitt and Manning, 2019), which aims to investigate the encoding of syntactic\nstructure in contextual representations through learning only linear\ntransformations. By observing that the structural probe learns a metric, we are\nable to kernelize it and develop a novel non-linear variant with an identical\nnumber of parameters. We test on 6 languages and find that the radial-basis\nfunction (RBF) kernel, in conjunction with regularization, achieves a\nstatistically significant improvement over the baseline in all languages --\nimplying that at least part of the syntactic knowledge is encoded non-linearly.\nWe conclude by discussing how the RBF kernel resembles BERT's self-attention\nlayers and speculate that this resemblance leads to the RBF-based probe's\nstronger performance.",

          "description": "End-to-end spoken language understanding (SLU) has recently attracted\nincreasing interest. Compared to the conventional tandem-based approach that\ncombines speech recognition and language understanding as separate modules, the\nnew approach extracts users' intentions directly from the speech signals,\nresulting in joint optimization and low latency. Such an approach, however, is\ntypically designed to process one intention at a time, which leads users to\ntake multiple rounds to fulfill their requirements while interacting with a\ndialogue system. In this paper, we propose a streaming end-to-end framework\nthat can process multiple intentions in an online and incremental way. The\nbackbone of our framework is a unidirectional RNN trained with the\nconnectionist temporal classification (CTC) criterion. By this design, an\nintention can be identified when sufficient evidence has been accumulated, and\nmultiple intentions can be identified sequentially. We evaluate our solution on\nthe Fluent Speech Commands (FSC) dataset and the intent detection accuracy is\nabout 97 % on all multi-intent settings. This result is comparable to the\nperformance of the state-of-the-art non-streaming models, but is achieved in an\nonline and incremental way. We also employ our model to a keyword spotting task\nusing the Google Speech Commands dataset and the results are also highly\npromising.",

          "description": "Personalized conversation models (PCMs) generate responses according to\nspeaker preferences. Existing personalized conversation tasks typically require\nmodels to extract speaker preferences from user descriptions or their\nconversation histories, which are scarce for newcomers and inactive users. In\nthis paper, we propose a few-shot personalized conversation task with an\nauxiliary social network. The task requires models to generate personalized\nresponses for a speaker given a few conversations from the speaker and a social\nnetwork. Existing methods are mainly designed to incorporate descriptions or\nconversation histories. Those methods can hardly model speakers with so few\nconversations or connections between speakers. To better cater for newcomers\nwith few resources, we propose a personalized conversation model (PCM) that\nlearns to adapt to new speakers as well as enabling new speakers to learn from\nresource-rich speakers. Particularly, based on a meta-learning based PCM, we\npropose a task aggregator (TA) to collect other speakers' information from the\nsocial network.

          "description": "In a dialogue system pipeline, a natural language generation (NLG) unit\nconverts the dialogue direction and content to a corresponding natural language\nrealization. A recent trend for dialogue systems is to first pre-train on large\ndatasets and then fine-tune in a supervised manner using datasets annotated\nwith application-specific features. Though novel behaviours can be learned from\ncustom annotation, the required effort severely bounds the quantity of the\ntraining set, and the application-specific nature limits the reuse. In light of\nthe recent success of data-driven approaches, we propose the novel future\nbridging NLG (FBNLG) concept for dialogue systems and simulators. The critical\nstep is for an FBNLG to accept a future user or system utterance to bridge the\npresent context towards. Future bridging enables self supervised training over\nannotation-free datasets, decoupled the training of NLG from the rest of the\nsystem. An FBNLG, pre-trained with massive datasets, is expected to apply in\nclassical or new dialogue scenarios with minimal adaptation effort.

          "description": "Logical reasoning, which is closely related to human cognition, is of vital\nimportance in human's understanding of texts. Recent years have witnessed\nincreasing attentions on machine's logical reasoning abilities. However,\nprevious studies commonly apply ad-hoc methods to model pre-defined relation\npatterns, such as linking named entities, which only considers global knowledge\ncomponents that are related to commonsense, without local perception of\ncomplete facts or events. Such methodology is obviously insufficient to deal\nwith complicated logical structures. Therefore, we argue that the natural logic\nunits would be the group of backbone constituents of the sentence such as the\nsubject-verb-object formed \"facts\", covering both global and local knowledge\npieces that are necessary as the basis for logical reasoning. Beyond building\nthe ad-hoc graphs, we propose a more general and convenient fact-driven\napproach to construct a supergraph on top of our newly defined fact units, and\nenhance the supergraph with further explicit guidance of local question and\noption interactions. Experiments on two challenging logical reasoning benchmark\ndatasets, ReClor and LogiQA, show that our proposed model, \\textsc{Focal\nReasoner}, outperforms the baseline models dramatically.

          "description": "This paper investigates the research question if senders of large amounts of\nirrelevant or unsolicited information - commonly called \"spammers\" - distort\nthe network structure of social networks. Two large social networks are\nanalyzed, the first extracted from the Twitter discourse about a big\ntelecommunication company, and the second obtained from three years of email\ncommunication of 200 managers working for a large multinational company. This\nwork compares network robustness and the stability of centrality and\ninteraction metrics, as well as the use of language, after removing spammers\nand the most and least connected nodes. The results show that spammers do not\nsignificantly alter the structure of the information-carrying network, for most\nof the social indicators. The authors additionally investigate the correlation\nbetween e-mail subject line and content by tracking language sentiment,\nemotionality, and complexity, addressing the cases where collecting email\nbodies is not permitted for privacy reasons. The findings extend the research\nabout robustness and stability of social networks metrics, after the\napplication of graph simplification strategies. The results have practical\nimplication for network analysts and for those company managers who rely on\nnetwork analytics (applied to company emails and social media data) to support\ntheir decision-making processes.",

In this work, we make two major contributions considering\nthe above limitations: (1) we develop a Hindi-English code-mixed dataset,\nMaSaC, for the multi-modal sarcasm detection and humor classification in\nconversational dialog, which to our knowledge is the first dataset of its kind;\n(2) we propose MSH-COMICS, a novel attention-rich neural architecture for the\nutterance classification.

          "description": "Story visualization is an under-explored task that falls at the intersection\nof many important research directions in both computer vision and natural\nlanguage processing. In this task, given a series of natural language captions\nwhich compose a story, an agent must generate a sequence of images that\ncorrespond to the captions. Prior work has introduced recurrent generative\nmodels which outperform text-to-image synthesis models on this task. However,\nthere is room for improvement of generated images in terms of visual quality,\ncoherence and relevance. We present a number of improvements to prior modeling\napproaches, including (1) the addition of a dual learning framework that\nutilizes video captioning to reinforce the semantic alignment between the story\nand generated images, (2) a copy-transform mechanism for\nsequentially-consistent story visualization, and (3) MART-based transformers to\nmodel complex interactions between frames. We present ablation studies to\ndemonstrate the effect of each of these techniques on the generative power of\nthe model for both individual images as well as the entire narrative.\nFurthermore, due to the complexity and generative nature of the task, standard\nevaluation metrics do not accurately reflect performance. Therefore, we also\nprovide an exploration of evaluation metrics for the model, focused on aspects\nof the generated frames such as the presence/quality of generated characters,\nthe relevance to captions, and the diversity of the generated images.

          "description": "Supervised deep learning has swiftly become a workhorse for accelerated MRI\nin recent years, offering state-of-the-art performance in image reconstruction\nfrom undersampled acquisitions. Training deep supervised models requires large\ndatasets of undersampled and fully-sampled acquisitions typically from a\nmatching set of subjects. Given scarce access to large medical datasets, this\nlimitation has sparked interest in unsupervised methods that reduce reliance on\nfully-sampled ground-truth data. A common framework is based on the deep image\nprior, where network-driven regularization is enforced directly during\ninference on undersampled acquisitions. Yet, canonical convolutional\narchitectures are suboptimal in capturing long-range relationships, and\nrandomly initialized networks may hamper convergence. To address these\nlimitations, here we introduce a novel unsupervised MRI reconstruction method\nbased on zero-Shot Learned Adversarial TransformERs (SLATER). SLATER embodies a\ndeep adversarial network with cross-attention transformer blocks to map noise\nand latent variables onto MR images. This unconditional network learns a\nhigh-quality MRI prior in a self-supervised encoding task. A zero-shot\nreconstruction is performed on undersampled test data, where inference is\nperformed by optimizing network parameters, latent and noise variables to\nensure maximal consistency to multi-coil MRI data. Comprehensive experiments on\nbrain MRI datasets clearly demonstrate the superior performance of SLATER\nagainst several state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.",

In this\nprocess, pathologists manually analyze prostate histology slides under\nmicroscope, in a high time-consuming and subjective task. In the last years,\ncomputer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) systems have emerged as a promising tool that\ncould support pathologists in the daily clinical practice. Nevertheless, these\nsystems are usually trained using tedious and prone-to-error pixel-level\nannotations of Gleason grades in the tissue. To alleviate the need of manual\npixel-wise labeling, just a handful of works have been presented in the\nliterature. Motivated by this, we propose a novel weakly-supervised\ndeep-learning model, based on self-learning CNNs, that leverages only the\nglobal Gleason score of gigapixel whole slide images during training to\naccurately perform both, grading of patch-level patterns and biopsy-level\nscoring. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we perform\nextensive experiments on three different external datasets for the patch-level\nGleason grading, and on two different test sets for global Grade Group\nprediction. We empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms its\nsupervised counterpart on patch-level Gleason grading by a large margin, as\nwell as state-of-the-art methods on global biopsy-level scoring. Particularly,\nthe proposed model brings an average improvement on the Cohen's quadratic kappa\n(k) score of nearly 18% compared to full-supervision for the patch-level\nGleason grading task.",

          "description": "Recently, text detection has attracted sufficient attention in the field of\ncomputer vision and artificial intelligence. Among the existing approaches,\nregression-based models are limited to handle the texts with arbitrary shapes,\nwhile segmentation-based algorithms have high computational costs and suffer\nfrom the text adhesion problem. In this paper, we propose a new one-stage text\ndetector, termed as Bold Outline Text Detector (BOTD), which is able to process\nthe arbitrary-shaped text with low model complexity. Different from previous\nworks, BOTD utilizes the Polar Minimum Distance (PMD) to encode the shortest\ndistance between the center point and the contour of the text instance, and\ngenerates a Center Mask (CM) for each text instance. After learning the PMD\nheat map and CM map, the final results can be obtained with a simple Text\nReconstruction Module (TRM). Since the CM resides within the text box exactly,\nthe text adhesion problem is avoided naturally. Meanwhile, all the points on\nthe text contour share the same PMD, so the complexity of BOTD is much lower\nthan existing segmentation-based methods. Experimental results on three\nreal-world benchmarks show the state-of-the-art performance of BOTD.",

          "description": "The Gleason scoring system is the primary diagnostic and prognostic tool for\nprostate cancer. In recent years, with the development of digitisation devices,\nthe use of computer vision techniques for the analysis of biopsies has\nincreased. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the development of\nalgorithms to automatically detect individual cribriform patterns belonging to\nGleason grade 4 has not yet been studied in the literature. The objective of\nthe work presented in this paper is to develop a deep-learning-based system\nable to support pathologists in the daily analysis of prostate biopsies. The\nmethodological core of this work is a patch-wise predictive model based on\nconvolutional neural networks able to determine the presence of cancerous\npatterns. In particular, we train from scratch a simple self-design\narchitecture. The cribriform pattern is detected by retraining the set of\nfilters of the last convolutional layer in the network. From the reconstructed\nprediction map, we compute the percentage of each Gleason grade in the tissue\nto feed a multi-layer perceptron which provides a biopsy-level score.mIn our\nSICAPv2 database, composed of 182 annotated whole slide images, we obtained a\nCohen's quadratic kappa of 0.77 in the test set for the patch-level Gleason\ngrading with the proposed architecture trained from scratch. Our results\noutperform previous ones reported in the literature. Furthermore, this model\nreaches the level of fine-tuned state-of-the-art architectures in a\npatient-based four groups cross validation. In the cribriform pattern detection\ntask, we obtained an area under ROC curve of 0.82. Regarding the biopsy Gleason\nscoring, we achieved a quadratic Cohen's Kappa of 0.81 in the test subset.\nShallow CNN architectures trained from scratch outperform current\nstate-of-the-art methods for Gleason grades classification.",

          "description": "This work attempts to provide a plausible theoretical framework that aims to\ninterpret modern deep (convolutional) networks from the principles of data\ncompression and discriminative representation. We show that for\nhigh-dimensional multi-class data, the optimal linear discriminative\nrepresentation maximizes the coding rate difference between the whole dataset\nand the average of all the subsets. We show that the basic iterative gradient\nascent scheme for optimizing the rate reduction objective naturally leads to a\nmulti-layer deep network, named ReduNet, that shares common characteristics of\nmodern deep networks. The deep layered architectures, linear and nonlinear\noperators, and even parameters of the network are all explicitly constructed\nlayer-by-layer via forward propagation, instead of learned via back\npropagation. All components of so-obtained \"white-box\" network have precise\noptimization, statistical, and geometric interpretation. Moreover, all linear\noperators of the so-derived network naturally become multi-channel convolutions\nwhen we enforce classification to be rigorously shift-invariant. The derivation\nalso indicates that such a deep convolution network is significantly more\nefficient to construct and learn in the spectral domain. Our preliminary\nsimulations and experiments clearly verify the effectiveness of both the rate\nreduction objective and the associated ReduNet.

          "description": "The way features propagate in Fully Convolutional Networks is of momentous\nimportance to capture multi-scale contexts for obtaining precise segmentation\nmasks. This paper proposes a novel series-parallel hybrid paradigm called the\nChained Context Aggregation Module (CAM) to diversify feature propagation. CAM\ngains features of various spatial scales through chain-connected ladder-style\ninformation flows and fuses them in a two-stage process, namely pre-fusion and\nre-fusion. The serial flow continuously increases receptive fields of output\nneurons and those in parallel encode different region-based contexts. Each\ninformation flow is a shallow encoder-decoder with appropriate down-sampling\nscales to sufficiently capture contextual information. We further adopt an\nattention model in CAM to guide feature re-fusion. Based on these developments,\nwe construct the Chained Context Aggregation Network (CANet), which employs an\nasymmetric decoder to recover precise spatial details of prediction maps. We\nconduct extensive experiments on six challenging datasets, including Pascal VOC\n2012, Pascal Context, Cityscapes, CamVid, SUN-RGBD and GATECH.

          "description": "Recently, there has been substantial progress in image synthesis from\nsemantic labelmaps. However, methods used for this task assume the availability\nof complete and unambiguous labelmaps, with instance boundaries of objects, and\nclass labels for each pixel. This reliance on heavily annotated inputs\nrestricts the application of image synthesis techniques to real-world\napplications, especially under uncertainty due to weather, occlusion, or noise.\nOn the other hand, algorithms that can synthesize images from sparse labelmaps\nor sketches are highly desirable as tools that can guide content creators and\nartists to quickly generate scenes by simply specifying locations of a few\nobjects. In this paper, we address the problem of complex scene completion from\nsparse labelmaps. Under this setting, very few details about the scene (30\\% of\nobject instances) are available as input for image synthesis. We propose a\ntwo-stage deep network based method, called `Halluci-Net', that learns\nco-occurence relationships between objects in scenes, and then exploits these\nrelationships to produce a dense and complete labelmap. The generated dense\nlabelmap can then be used as input by state-of-the-art image synthesis\ntechniques like pix2pixHD to obtain the final image. The proposed method is\nevaluated on the Cityscapes dataset and it outperforms two baselines methods on\nperformance metrics like Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID), semantic\nsegmentation accuracy, and similarity in object co-occurrences. We also show\nqualitative results on a subset of ADE20K dataset that contains bedroom images.",

          "description": "Ordinal embedding aims at finding a low dimensional representation of objects\nfrom a set of constraints of the form \"item $j$ is closer to item $i$ than item\n$k$\". Typically, each object is mapped onto a point vector in a low dimensional\nmetric space. We argue that mapping to a density instead of a point vector\nprovides some interesting advantages, including an inherent reflection of the\nuncertainty about the representation itself and its relative location in the\nspace. Indeed, in this paper, we propose to embed each object as a Gaussian\ndistribution. We investigate the ability of these embeddings to capture the\nunderlying structure of the data while satisfying the constraints, and explore\nproperties of the representation.

One of\nthe most promising methods to estimate the harvest is berry counting, as it can\nbe approached non-destructively, and its process can be automated. In this\narticle, we present a method that addresses the challenge of occluded berries\nwith leaves to obtain a more accurate estimate of the number of berries that\nwill enable a better estimate of the harvest. We use generative adversarial\nnetworks, a deep learning-based approach that generates a likely scenario\nbehind the leaves exploiting learned patterns from images with non-occluded\nberries. Our experiments show that the estimate of the number of berries after\napplying our method is closer to the manually counted reference. In contrast to\napplying a factor to the berry count, our approach better adapts to local\nconditions by directly involving the appearance of the visible berries.\nFurthermore, we show that our approach can identify which areas in the image\nshould be changed by adding new berries without explicitly requiring\ninformation about hidden areas.",

          "description": "Vision transformers (ViT) have demonstrated impressive performance across\nvarious machine vision problems. These models are based on multi-head\nself-attention mechanisms that can flexibly attend to a sequence of image\npatches to encode contextual cues. An important question is how such\nflexibility in attending image-wide context conditioned on a given patch can\nfacilitate handling nuisances in natural images e.g., severe occlusions, domain\nshifts, spatial permutations, adversarial and natural perturbations. We\nsystematically study this question via an extensive set of experiments\nencompassing three ViT families and comparisons with a high-performing\nconvolutional neural network (CNN). We show and analyze the following\nintriguing properties of ViT: (a) Transformers are highly robust to severe\nocclusions, perturbations and domain shifts, e.g., retain as high as 60% top-1\naccuracy on ImageNet even after randomly occluding 80% of the image content.\n(b) The robust performance to occlusions is not due to a bias towards local\ntextures, and ViTs are significantly less biased towards textures compared to\nCNNs. When properly trained to encode shape-based features, ViTs demonstrate\nshape recognition capability comparable to that of human visual system,\npreviously unmatched in the literature. (c) Using ViTs to encode shape\nrepresentation leads to an interesting consequence of accurate semantic\nsegmentation without pixel-level supervision. (d) Off-the-shelf features from a\nsingle ViT model can be combined to create a feature ensemble, leading to high\naccuracy rates across a range of classification datasets in both traditional\nand few-shot learning paradigms. We show effective features of ViTs are due to\nflexible and dynamic receptive fields possible via the self-attention\nmechanism.",

          "description": "We present a learning-based method for building driving-signal aware\nfull-body avatars. Our model is a conditional variational autoencoder that can\nbe animated with incomplete driving signals, such as human pose and facial\nkeypoints, and produces a high-quality representation of human geometry and\nview-dependent appearance. The core intuition behind our method is that better\ndrivability and generalization can be achieved by disentangling the driving\nsignals and remaining generative factors, which are not available during\nanimation. To this end, we explicitly account for information deficiency in the\ndriving signal by introducing a latent space that exclusively captures the\nremaining information, thus enabling the imputation of the missing factors\nrequired during full-body animation, while remaining faithful to the driving\nsignal. We also propose a learnable localized compression for the driving\nsignal which promotes better generalization, and helps minimize the influence\nof global chance-correlations often found in real datasets. For a given driving\nsignal, the resulting variational model produces a compact space of uncertainty\nfor missing factors that allows for an imputation strategy best suited to a\nparticular application. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on the\nchallenging problem of full-body animation for virtual telepresence with\ndriving signals acquired from minimal sensors placed in the environment and\nmounted on a VR-headset.",

In this work, we propose a deep-learning-based system\nable to detect local cancerous patterns in the prostate tissue using only the\nglobal-level Gleason score during training. The methodological core of this\nwork is the proposed weakly-supervised-trained convolutional neural network,\nWeGleNet, based on a multi-class segmentation layer after the feature\nextraction module, a global-aggregation, and the slicing of the background\nclass for the model loss estimation during training. We obtained a Cohen's\nquadratic kappa (k) of 0.67 for the pixel-level prediction of cancerous\npatterns in the validation cohort. We compared the model performance for\nsemantic segmentation of Gleason grades with supervised state-of-the-art\narchitectures in the test cohort. We obtained a pixel-level k of 0.61 and a\nmacro-averaged f1-score of 0.58, at the same level as fully-supervised methods.\nRegarding the estimation of the core-level Gleason score, we obtained a k of\n0.76 and 0.67 between the model and two different pathologists. WeGleNet is\ncapable of performing the semantic segmentation of Gleason grades similarly to\nfully-supervised methods without requiring pixel-level annotations.",

          "description": "Single image super-resolution (SISR) deals with a fundamental problem of\nupsampling a low-resolution (LR) image to its high-resolution (HR) version.\nLast few years have witnessed impressive progress propelled by deep learning\nmethods. However, one critical challenge faced by existing methods is to strike\na sweet spot of deep model complexity and resulting SISR quality. This paper\naddresses this pain point by proposing a linearly-assembled pixel-adaptive\nregression network (LAPAR), which casts the direct LR to HR mapping learning\ninto a linear coefficient regression task over a dictionary of multiple\npredefined filter bases. Such a parametric representation renders our model\nhighly lightweight and easy to optimize while achieving state-of-the-art\nresults on SISR benchmarks. Moreover, based on the same idea, LAPAR is extended\nto tackle other restoration tasks, e.g., image denoising and JPEG image\ndeblocking, and again, yields strong performance.

Feature composition allows\nus to not only selectively compose features of every class from only relevant\ntraining samples, but also obtain diversity among composed features via\nchanging samples used for the composition.

          "description": "Learning maps between data samples is fundamental. Applications range from\nrepresentation learning, image translation and generative modeling, to the\nestimation of spatial deformations. Such maps relate feature vectors, or map\nbetween feature spaces. Well-behaved maps should be regular, which can be\nimposed explicitly or may emanate from the data itself. We explore what induces\nregularity for spatial transformations, e.g., when computing image\nregistrations. Classical optimization-based models compute maps between pairs\nof samples and rely on an appropriate regularizer for well-posedness. Recent\ndeep learning approaches have attempted to avoid using such regularizers\naltogether by relying on the sample population instead. We explore if it is\npossible to obtain spatial regularity using an inverse consistency loss only\nand elucidate what explains map regularity in such a context. We find that deep\nnetworks combined with an inverse consistency loss and randomized off-grid\ninterpolation yield well behaved, approximately diffeomorphic, spatial\ntransformations. Despite the simplicity of this approach, our experiments\npresent compelling evidence, on both synthetic and real data, that regular maps\ncan be obtained without carefully tuned explicit regularizers, while achieving\ncompetitive registration performance.",

While\nrecent Deep Learning-based solutions achieve satisfactory performance, their\nhigh computational cost renders their application in real-life settings in\nwhich computations need to be performed on embedded platforms intractable. In\nthis paper, we analyze the efficiency of two popular voxel-based 3D object\ndetection methods providing a good compromise between high performance and\nspeed based on two aspects, their ability to detect objects located at large\ndistances from the agent and their ability to operate in real time on embedded\nplatforms equipped with high-performance GPUs. Our experiments show that these\nmethods mostly fail to detect distant small objects due to the sparsity of the\ninput point clouds at large distances. Moreover, models trained on near objects\nachieve similar or better performance compared to those trained on all objects\nin the scene. This means that the models learn object appearance\nrepresentations mostly from near objects. Our findings suggest that a\nconsiderable part of the computations of existing methods is focused on\nlocations of the scene that do not contribute with successful detection.

We then formulate the light field as a 4D\nfunction that maps 4D coordinates to corresponding color values. We train a\ndeep fully connected network to optimize this implicit function and memorize\nthe 3D scene. Then, the scene-specific model is used to synthesize novel views.\nDifferent from previous light field approaches which require dense view\nsampling to reliably render novel views, our method can render novel views by\nsampling rays and querying the color for each ray from the network directly,\nthus enabling high-quality light field rendering with a sparser set of training\nimages. Our method achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis results while\nmaintaining an interactive frame rate.",

          "description": "In this work, we propose a data-driven scheme to initialize the parameters of\na deep neural network. This is in contrast to traditional approaches which\nrandomly initialize parameters by sampling from transformed standard\ndistributions. Such methods do not use the training data to produce a more\ninformed initialization. Our method uses a sequential layer-wise approach where\neach layer is initialized using its input activations. The initialization is\ncast as an optimization problem where we minimize a combination of encoding and\ndecoding losses of the input activations, which is further constrained by a\nuser-defined latent code. The optimization problem is then restructured into\nthe well-known Sylvester equation, which has fast and efficient gradient-free\nsolutions. Our data-driven method achieves a boost in performance compared to\nrandom initialization methods, both before start of training and after training\nis over. We show that our proposed method is especially effective in few-shot\nand fine-tuning settings. We conclude this paper with analyses on time\ncomplexity and the effect of different latent codes on the recognition\nperformance.",

In this work, we propose multimodal\nknowledge expansion (MKE), a knowledge distillation-based framework to\neffectively utilize multimodal data without requiring labels. Opposite to\ntraditional knowledge distillation, where the student is designed to be\nlightweight and inferior to the teacher, we observe that a multimodal student\nmodel consistently denoises pseudo labels and generalizes better than its\nteacher.

          "description": "Hidden features in neural network usually fail to learn informative\nrepresentation for 3D segmentation as supervisions are only given on output\nprediction, while this can be solved by omni-scale supervision on intermediate\nlayers. In this paper, we bring the first omni-scale supervision method to\npoint cloud segmentation via the proposed gradual Receptive Field Component\nReasoning (RFCR), where target Receptive Field Component Codes (RFCCs) are\ndesigned to record categories within receptive fields for hidden units in the\nencoder. Then, target RFCCs will supervise the decoder to gradually infer the\nRFCCs in a coarse-to-fine categories reasoning manner, and finally obtain the\nsemantic labels. Because many hidden features are inactive with tiny magnitude\nand make minor contributions to RFCC prediction, we propose a Feature\nDensification with a centrifugal potential to obtain more unambiguous features,\nand it is in effect equivalent to entropy regularization over features. More\nactive features can further unleash the potential of our omni-supervision\nmethod. We embed our method into four prevailing backbones and test on three\nchallenging benchmarks.

In\nthis paper, we introduce a fixed viewpoint approach to dense surface\nreconstruction of transparent objects based on refraction of light. We present\na simple setup that allows us to alter the incident light paths before light\nrays enter the object by immersing the object partially in a liquid, and\ndevelop a method for recovering the object surface through reconstructing and\ntriangulating such incident light paths. Our proposed approach does not need to\nmodel the complex interactions of light as it travels through the object,\nneither does it assume any parametric form for the object shape nor the exact\nnumber of refractions and reflections taken place along the light paths. It can\ntherefore handle transparent objects with a relatively complex shape and\nstructure, with unknown and inhomogeneous refractive index. We also show that\nfor thin transparent objects, our proposed acquisition setup can be further\nsimplified by adopting a single refraction approximation.

To obtain the optimal result, we start with formulating a Direct\nBundle Adjustment (DBA) problem which jointly optimizes pose parameters of\nlocal frames and intensities of panoramic image. By proving the independence of\nthe pose from panoramic image in the iterative process, DSR is proposed and\nproved to be able to generate the same optimal poses as DBA, but without\noptimizing the intensities of the panoramic image. The proposed DSR method is\nparticularly suitable in mono-modal registration and in the scenarios where\ndistinct features are not available, such as Transesophageal Echocardiography\n(TEE) images. The proposed method is validated via simulated and in-vivo 3D TEE\nimages. It is shown that the proposed method outperforms conventional\nsequential registration method in terms of accuracy and the obtained results\ncan produce good alignment in in-vivo images.",

          "description": "Story visualization is an under-explored task that falls at the intersection\nof many important research directions in both computer vision and natural\nlanguage processing. In this task, given a series of natural language captions\nwhich compose a story, an agent must generate a sequence of images that\ncorrespond to the captions. Prior work has introduced recurrent generative\nmodels which outperform text-to-image synthesis models on this task. However,\nthere is room for improvement of generated images in terms of visual quality,\ncoherence and relevance. We present a number of improvements to prior modeling\napproaches, including (1) the addition of a dual learning framework that\nutilizes video captioning to reinforce the semantic alignment between the story\nand generated images, (2) a copy-transform mechanism for\nsequentially-consistent story visualization, and (3) MART-based transformers to\nmodel complex interactions between frames. We present ablation studies to\ndemonstrate the effect of each of these techniques on the generative power of\nthe model for both individual images as well as the entire narrative.\nFurthermore, due to the complexity and generative nature of the task, standard\nevaluation metrics do not accurately reflect performance. Therefore, we also\nprovide an exploration of evaluation metrics for the model, focused on aspects\nof the generated frames such as the presence/quality of generated characters,\nthe relevance to captions, and the diversity of the generated images.

          "description": "Over the last few decades, Lung Ultrasound (LUS) has been increasingly used\nto diagnose and monitor different lung diseases in neonates. It is a non\ninvasive tool that allows a fast bedside examination while minimally handling\nthe neonate. Acquiring a LUS scan is easy, but understanding the artifacts\nconcerned with each respiratory disease is challenging. Mixed artifact patterns\nfound in different respiratory diseases may limit LUS readability by the\noperator. While machine learning (ML), especially deep learning can assist in\nautomated analysis, simply feeding the ultrasound images to an ML model for\ndiagnosis is not enough to earn the trust of medical professionals. The\nalgorithm should output LUS features that are familiar to the operator instead.\nTherefore, in this paper we present a unique approach for extracting seven\nmeaningful LUS features that can be easily associated with a specific\npathological lung condition: Normal pleura, irregular pleura, thick pleura,\nAlines, Coalescent B-lines, Separate B-lines and Consolidations. These\nartifacts can lead to early prediction of infants developing later respiratory\ndistress symptoms. A single multi-class region proposal-based object detection\nmodel faster-RCNN (fRCNN) was trained on lower posterior lung ultrasound videos\nto detect these LUS features which are further linked to four common neonatal\ndiseases. Our results show that fRCNN surpasses single stage models such as\nRetinaNet and can successfully detect the aforementioned LUS features with a\nmean average precision of 86.4%. Instead of a fully automatic diagnosis from\nimages without any interpretability, detection of such LUS features leave the\nultimate control of diagnosis to the clinician, which can result in a more\ntrustworthy intelligent system.",

          "description": "Face recognition has achieved significant progress in deep-learning era due\nto the ultra-large-scale and well-labeled datasets. However, training on\nultra-large-scale datasets is time-consuming and takes up a lot of hardware\nresource. Therefore, how to design an appropriate training approach is very\ncrucial and indispensable. The computational and hardware cost of training\nultra-large-scale datasets mainly focuses on the Fully-Connected (FC) layer\nrather than convolutional layers. To this end, we propose a novel training\napproach for ultra-large-scale face datasets, termed Faster Face Classification\n(F$^2$C). In F$^2$C, we first define a Gallery Net and a Probe Net that are\nused to generate identities' centers and extract faces' features for face\nrecognition, respectively. Gallery Net has the same structure as Probe Net and\ninherits the parameters from Probe Net with a moving average paradigm. After\nthat, to reduce the training time and hardware resource occupancy of the FC\nlayer, we propose the Dynamic Class Pool that stores the features from Gallery\nNet and calculates the inner product (logits) with positive samples (its\nidentities appear in Dynamic Class Pool) in each mini-batch. Dynamic Class Pool\ncan be regarded as a substitute for the FC layer and its size is much smaller\nthan FC, which is the reason why Dynamic Class Pool can largely reduce the time\nand resource cost. For negative samples (its identities are not appear in the\nDynamic Class Pool), we minimize the cosine similarities between negative\nsamples and Dynamic Class Pool. Then, to improve the update efficiency and\nspeed of Dynamic Class Pool's parameters, we design the Dual Loaders including\nIdentity-based and Instance-based Loaders. Dual Loaders load images from given\ndataset by instances and identities to generate batches for training.",

These Autoencoder-based methods usually calculate\nthe anomaly score from the reconstruction error, the difference between the\ninput image and the reconstructed image. On the other hand, the accuracy of the\nreconstruction is insufficient in many of these methods, so it leads to\ndegraded accuracy of anomaly detection. To improve the accuracy of the\nreconstruction, we consider defining loss function in the frequency domain. In\ngeneral, we know that natural images contain many low-frequency components and\nfew high-frequency components. Hence, to improve the accuracy of the\nreconstruction of high-frequency components, we introduce a new loss function\nnamed weighted frequency domain loss(WFDL). WFDL provides a sharper\nreconstructed image, which contributes to improving the accuracy of anomaly\ndetection.

          "description": "Mammogram mass detection is crucial for diagnosing and preventing the breast\ncancers in clinical practice. The complementary effect of multi-view mammogram\nimages provides valuable information about the breast anatomical prior\nstructure and is of great significance in digital mammography interpretation.\nHowever, unlike radiologists who can utilize the natural reasoning ability to\nidentify masses based on multiple mammographic views, how to endow the existing\nobject detection models with the capability of multi-view reasoning is vital\nfor decision-making in clinical diagnosis but remains the boundary to explore.\nIn this paper, we propose an Anatomy-aware Graph convolutional Network (AGN),\nwhich is tailored for mammogram mass detection and endows existing detection\nmethods with multi-view reasoning ability. The proposed AGN consists of three\nsteps. Firstly, we introduce a Bipartite Graph convolutional Network (BGN) to\nmodel the intrinsic geometric and semantic relations of ipsilateral views.\nSecondly, considering that the visual asymmetry of bilateral views is widely\nadopted in clinical practice to assist the diagnosis of breast lesions, we\npropose an Inception Graph convolutional Network (IGN) to model the structural\nsimilarities of bilateral views. Finally, based on the constructed graphs, the\nmulti-view information is propagated through nodes methodically, which equips\nthe features learned from the examined view with multi-view reasoning ability.\nExperiments on two standard benchmarks reveal that AGN significantly exceeds\nthe state-of-the-art performance. Visualization results show that AGN provides\ninterpretable visual cues for clinical diagnosis.",

          "description": "Pelvic ring disruptions result from blunt injury mechanisms and are often\nfound in patients with multi-system trauma. To grade pelvic fracture severity\nin trauma victims based on whole-body CT, the Tile AO/OTA classification is\nfrequently used. Due to the high volume of whole-body trauma CTs generated in\nbusy trauma centers, an automated approach to Tile classification would provide\nsubstantial value, e.,g., to prioritize the reading queue of the attending\ntrauma radiologist. In such scenario, an automated method should perform\ngrading based on a transparent process and based on interpretable features to\nenable interaction with human readers and lower their workload by offering\ninsights from a first automated read of the scan. This paper introduces an\nautomated yet interpretable pelvic trauma decision support system to assist\nradiologists in fracture detection and Tile grade classification. The method\noperates similarly to human interpretation of CT scans and first detects\ndistinct pelvic fractures on CT with high specificity using a Faster-RCNN model\nthat are then interpreted using a structural causal model based on clinical\nbest practices to infer an initial Tile grade. The Bayesian causal model and\nfinally, the object detector are then queried for likely co-occurring fractures\nthat may have been rejected initially due to the highly specific operating\npoint of the detector, resulting in an updated list of detected fractures and\ncorresponding final Tile grade. Our method is transparent in that it provides\nfinding location and type using the object detector, as well as information on\nimportant counterfactuals that would invalidate the system's recommendation and\nachieves an AUC of 83.3%/85.1% for translational/rotational instability.\nDespite being designed for human-machine teaming, our approach does not\ncompromise on performance compared to previous black-box approaches.",

Recently, many online methods have emerged to narrow the\nperformance gap between training data (source domain) and test data (target\ndomain) by fine-tuning on annotations of test data which are usually in\nshortage. In this paper, we propose a novel method to tackle domain shift by\nfirst introducing adversarial domain adaptation to the VOS task, with\nsupervised training on the source domain and unsupervised training on the\ntarget domain. By fusing appearance and motion features with a convolution\nlayer, and by adding supervision onto the motion branch, our model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on DAVIS2016 with 82.6% mean IoU score after\nsupervised training. Meanwhile, our adversarial domain adaptation strategy\nsignificantly raises the performance of the trained model when applied on\nFBMS59 and Youtube-Object, without exploiting extra annotations.",

          "description": "Over the past decades, enormous efforts have been made to improve the\nperformance of linear or nonlinear mixing models for hyperspectral unmixing,\nyet their ability to simultaneously generalize various spectral variabilities\nand extract physically meaningful endmembers still remains limited due to the\npoor ability in data fitting and reconstruction and the sensitivity to various\nspectral variabilities. Inspired by the powerful learning ability of deep\nlearning, we attempt to develop a general deep learning approach for\nhyperspectral unmixing, by fully considering the properties of endmembers\nextracted from the hyperspectral imagery, called endmember-guided unmixing\nnetwork (EGU-Net). Beyond the alone autoencoder-like architecture, EGU-Net is a\ntwo-stream Siamese deep network, which learns an additional network from the\npure or nearly-pure endmembers to correct the weights of another unmixing\nnetwork by sharing network parameters and adding spectrally meaningful\nconstraints (e.g., non-negativity and sum-to-one) towards a more accurate and\ninterpretable unmixing solution. Furthermore, the resulting general framework\nis not only limited to pixel-wise spectral unmixing but also applicable to\nspatial information modeling with convolutional operators for spatial-spectral\nunmixing. Experimental results conducted on three different datasets with the\nground-truth of abundance maps corresponding to each material demonstrate the\neffectiveness and superiority of the EGU-Net over state-of-the-art unmixing\nalgorithms. The codes will be available from the website:\nhttps://github.com/danfenghong/IEEE_TNNLS_EGU-Net.",

The communication channel between\nthe edge and cloud is imperfect, which will result in missing data in the deep\nfeature tensor received at the cloud side. In this study, we examine the\neffectiveness of four low-rank tensor completion methods in recovering missing\ndata in the deep feature tensor.

          "description": "As remote sensing (RS) data obtained from different sensors become available\nlargely and openly, multimodal data processing and analysis techniques have\nbeen garnering increasing interest in the RS and geoscience community. However,\ndue to the gap between different modalities in terms of imaging sensors,\nresolutions, and contents, embedding their complementary information into a\nconsistent, compact, accurate, and discriminative representation, to a great\nextent, remains challenging. To this end, we propose a shared and specific\nfeature learning (S2FL) model. S2FL is capable of decomposing multimodal RS\ndata into modality-shared and modality-specific components, enabling the\ninformation blending of multi-modalities more effectively, particularly for\nheterogeneous data sources. Moreover, to better assess multimodal baselines and\nthe newly-proposed S2FL model, three multimodal RS benchmark datasets, i.e.,\nHouston2013 -- hyperspectral and multispectral data, Berlin -- hyperspectral\nand synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, Augsburg -- hyperspectral, SAR, and\ndigital surface model (DSM) data, are released and used for land cover\nclassification.

          "description": "Human pose estimation has achieved significant progress in recent years.\nHowever, most of the recent methods focus on improving accuracy using\ncomplicated models and ignoring real-time efficiency. To achieve a better\ntrade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we propose a novel neural\narchitecture search (NAS) method, termed ViPNAS, to search networks in both\nspatial and temporal levels for fast online video pose estimation. In the\nspatial level, we carefully design the search space with five different\ndimensions including network depth, width, kernel size, group number, and\nattentions. In the temporal level, we search from a series of temporal feature\nfusions to optimize the total accuracy and speed across multiple video frames.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to search for the temporal\nfeature fusion and automatic computation allocation in videos. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging\nCOCO2017 and PoseTrack2018 datasets. Our discovered model family, S-ViPNAS and\nT-ViPNAS, achieve significantly higher inference speed (CPU real-time) without\nsacrificing the accuracy compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "This is a short note on the performance of the ALI-G algorithm (Berrada et\nal., 2020) as reported in (Loizou et al., 2021). ALI-G (Berrada et al., 2020)\nand SPS (Loizou et al., 2021) are both adaptations of the Polyak step-size to\noptimize machine learning models that can interpolate the training data. The\nmain algorithmic differences are that (1) SPS employs a multiplicative constant\nin the denominator of the learning-rate while ALI-G uses an additive constant,\nand (2) SPS uses an iteration-dependent maximal learning-rate while ALI-G uses\na constant one. There are also differences in the analysis provided by the two\nworks, with less restrictive assumptions proposed in (Loizou et al., 2021). In\ntheir experiments, (Loizou et al., 2021) did not use momentum for ALI-G (which\nis a standard part of the algorithm) or standard hyper-parameter tuning (for\ne.g. learning-rate and regularization). Hence this note as a reference for the\nimproved performance that ALI-G can obtain with well-chosen hyper-parameters.\nIn particular, we show that when training a ResNet-34 on CIFAR-10 and\nCIFAR-100, the performance of ALI-G can reach respectively 93.5% (+6%) and 76%\n(+8%) with a very small amount of tuning. Thus ALI-G remains a very competitive\nmethod for training interpolating neural networks.",

          "description": "Machine learning applications have become ubiquitous. Their applications from\nmachine embedded control in production over process optimization in diverse\nareas (e.g., traffic, finance, sciences) to direct user interactions like\nadvertising and recommendations. This has led to an increased effort of making\nmachine learning trustworthy. Explainable and fair AI have already matured.\nThey address knowledgeable users and application engineers. However, there are\nusers that want to deploy a learned model in a similar way as their washing\nmachine. These stakeholders do not want to spend time understanding the model.\nInstead, they want to rely on guaranteed properties. What are the relevant\nproperties? How can they be expressed to stakeholders without presupposing\nmachine learning knowledge? How can they be guaranteed for a certain\nimplementation of a model? These questions move far beyond the current\nstate-of-the-art and we want to address them here. We propose a unified\nframework that certifies learning methods via care labels. They are easy to\nunderstand and draw inspiration from well-known certificates like textile\nlabels or property cards of electronic devices. Our framework considers both,\nthe machine learning theory and a given implementation. We test the\nimplementation's compliance with theoretical properties and bounds. In this\npaper, we illustrate care labels by a prototype implementation of a\ncertification suite for a selection of probabilistic graphical models.",

          "description": "The increasing complexity of algorithms for analyzing medical data, including\nde-identification tasks, raises the possibility that complex algorithms are\nlearning not just the general representation of the problem, but specifics of\ngiven individuals within the data. Modern legal frameworks specifically\nprohibit the intentional or accidental distribution of patient data, but have\nnot addressed this potential avenue for leakage of such protected health\ninformation. Modern deep learning algorithms have the highest potential of such\nleakage due to complexity of the models. Recent research in the field has\nhighlighted such issues in non-medical data, but all analysis is likely to be\ndata and algorithm specific. We, therefore, chose to analyze a state-of-the-art\nfree-text de-identification algorithm based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)\nand its potential in encoding any individual in the training set. Using the\ni2b2 Challenge Data, we trained, then analyzed the model to assess whether the\noutput of the LSTM, before the compression layer of the classifier, could be\nused to estimate the membership of the training data. Furthermore, we used\ndifferent attacks including membership inference attack method to attack the\nmodel. Results indicate that the attacks could not identify whether members of\nthe training data were distinguishable from non-members based on the model\noutput. This indicates that the model does not provide any strong evidence into\nthe identification of the individuals in the training data set and there is not\nyet empirical evidence it is unsafe to distribute the model for general use.",

Due to the easy\naccess, low cost, and faster reach of the information, people search out and\ndevour news from online social networks. In contrast, the increasing acceptance\nof social media reporting leads to the spread of fake news. This is a minacious\nproblem that causes disputes and endangers societal stability and harmony. Fake\nnews spread has gained attention from researchers due to its vicious nature.\nproliferation of misinformation in all media, from the internet to cable news,\npaid advertising and local news outlets, has made it essential for people to\nidentify the misinformation and sort through the facts. Researchers are trying\nto analyze the credibility of information and curtail false information on such\nplatforms. Credibility is the believability of the piece of information at\nhand. Analyzing the credibility of fake news is challenging due to the intent\nof its creation and the polychromatic nature of the news. In this work, we\npropose a model for detecting fake news. Our method investigates the content of\nthe news at the early stage i.e. when the news is published but is yet to be\ndisseminated through social media. Our work interprets the content with\nautomatic feature extraction and the relevance of the text pieces. In summary,\nwe introduce stance as one of the features along with the content of the\narticle and employ the pre-trained contextualized word embeddings BERT to\nobtain the state-of-art results for fake news detection. The experiment\nconducted on the real-world dataset indicates that our model outperforms the\nprevious work and enables fake news detection with an accuracy of 95.32%.",

The objective is to understand the convergence\nproperties of the invariant statistics when the underlying system of stochastic\ndifferential equations (SDEs) is empirically estimated with a supervised\nregression framework. Using the perturbation theory of ergodic Markov chains\nand the linear response theory, we deduce a linear dependence of the errors of\none-point and two-point invariant statistics on the error in the learning of\nthe drift and diffusion coefficients. More importantly, our study shows that\nthe usual $L^2$-norm characterization of the learning generalization error is\ninsufficient for achieving this linear dependence result. We find that\nsufficient conditions for such a linear dependence result are through learning\nalgorithms that produce a uniformly Lipschitz and consistent estimator in the\nhypothesis space that retains certain characteristics of the drift\ncoefficients, such as the usual linear growth condition that guarantees the\nexistence of solutions of the underlying SDEs.

          "description": "Supervised deep learning has swiftly become a workhorse for accelerated MRI\nin recent years, offering state-of-the-art performance in image reconstruction\nfrom undersampled acquisitions. Training deep supervised models requires large\ndatasets of undersampled and fully-sampled acquisitions typically from a\nmatching set of subjects. Given scarce access to large medical datasets, this\nlimitation has sparked interest in unsupervised methods that reduce reliance on\nfully-sampled ground-truth data. A common framework is based on the deep image\nprior, where network-driven regularization is enforced directly during\ninference on undersampled acquisitions. Yet, canonical convolutional\narchitectures are suboptimal in capturing long-range relationships, and\nrandomly initialized networks may hamper convergence. To address these\nlimitations, here we introduce a novel unsupervised MRI reconstruction method\nbased on zero-Shot Learned Adversarial TransformERs (SLATER). SLATER embodies a\ndeep adversarial network with cross-attention transformer blocks to map noise\nand latent variables onto MR images. This unconditional network learns a\nhigh-quality MRI prior in a self-supervised encoding task. A zero-shot\nreconstruction is performed on undersampled test data, where inference is\nperformed by optimizing network parameters, latent and noise variables to\nensure maximal consistency to multi-coil MRI data. Comprehensive experiments on\nbrain MRI datasets clearly demonstrate the superior performance of SLATER\nagainst several state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.",

          "description": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancer and one of\nthe leading causes of death among men, with almost 1.41 million new cases and\naround 375,000 deaths in 2020. Artificial Intelligence algorithms have had a\nhuge impact in medical image analysis, including digital histopathology, where\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to provide a fast and accurate\ndiagnosis, supporting experts in this task. To perform an automatic diagnosis,\nprostate tissue samples are first digitized into gigapixel-resolution\nwhole-slide images. Due to the size of these images, neural networks cannot use\nthem as input and, therefore, small subimages called patches are extracted and\npredicted, obtaining a patch-level classification. In this work, a novel patch\naggregation method based on a custom Wide & Deep neural network model is\npresented, which performs a slide-level classification using the patch-level\nclasses obtained from a CNN. The malignant tissue ratio, a 10-bin malignant\nprobability histogram, the least squares regression line of the histogram, and\nthe number of malignant connected components are used by the proposed model to\nperform the classification. An accuracy of 94.24% and a sensitivity of 98.87%\nwere achieved, proving that the proposed system could aid pathologists by\nspeeding up the screening process and, thus, contribute to the fight against\nPCa.",

          "description": "Massive multiple-input multiple-output can obtain more performance gain by\nexploiting the downlink channel state information (CSI) at the base station\n(BS). Therefore, studying CSI feedback with limited communication resources in\nfrequency-division duplexing systems is of great importance. Recently, deep\nlearning (DL)-based CSI feedback has shown considerable potential. However, the\nexisting DL-based explicit feedback schemes are difficult to deploy because\ncurrent fifth-generation mobile communication protocols and systems are\ndesigned based on an implicit feedback mechanism. In this paper, we propose a\nDL-based implicit feedback architecture to inherit the low-overhead\ncharacteristic, which uses neural networks (NNs) to replace the precoding\nmatrix indicator (PMI) encoding and decoding modules. By using environment\ninformation, the NNs can achieve a more refined mapping between the precoding\nmatrix and the PMI compared with codebooks. The correlation between subbands is\nalso used to further improve the feedback performance. Simulation results show\nthat, for a single resource block (RB), the proposed architecture can save\n25.0% and 40.0% of overhead compared with Type I codebook under two antenna\nconfigurations, respectively. For a wideband system with 52 RBs, overhead can\nbe saved by 30.7% and 48.0% compared with Type II codebook when ignoring and\nconsidering extracting subband correlation, respectively.",

One of\nthe most promising methods to estimate the harvest is berry counting, as it can\nbe approached non-destructively, and its process can be automated. In this\narticle, we present a method that addresses the challenge of occluded berries\nwith leaves to obtain a more accurate estimate of the number of berries that\nwill enable a better estimate of the harvest. We use generative adversarial\nnetworks, a deep learning-based approach that generates a likely scenario\nbehind the leaves exploiting learned patterns from images with non-occluded\nberries. Our experiments show that the estimate of the number of berries after\napplying our method is closer to the manually counted reference. In contrast to\napplying a factor to the berry count, our approach better adapts to local\nconditions by directly involving the appearance of the visible berries.\nFurthermore, we show that our approach can identify which areas in the image\nshould be changed by adding new berries without explicitly requiring\ninformation about hidden areas.",

Knowledge Distillation has recently emerged to tackle this issue, by\nrefining the server model using aggregated knowledge from heterogeneous users,\nother than directly averaging their model parameters.

One\noption to reduce it to a fraction of this cost is to resort to mini-batching in\nconjunction with unadjusted discretizations of Langevin dynamics, in which case\nonly a random fraction of the data is used to estimate the gradient. However,\nthis leads to an additional noise in the dynamics and hence a bias on the\ninvariant measure which is sampled by the Markov chain. We advocate using the\nso-called Adaptive Langevin dynamics, which is a modification of standard\ninertial Langevin dynamics with a dynamical friction which automatically\ncorrects for the increased noise arising from mini-batching.

          "description": "Time-series representation learning is a fundamental task for time-series\nanalysis. While significant progress has been made to achieve accurate\nrepresentations for downstream applications, the learned representations often\nlack interpretability and do not expose semantic meanings. Different from\nprevious efforts on the entangled feature space, we aim to extract the\nsemantic-rich temporal correlations in the latent interpretable factorized\nrepresentation of the data. Motivated by the success of disentangled\nrepresentation learning in computer vision, we study the possibility of\nlearning semantic-rich time-series representations, which remains unexplored\ndue to three main challenges: 1) sequential data structure introduces complex\ntemporal correlations and makes the latent representations hard to interpret,\n2) sequential models suffer from KL vanishing problem, and 3) interpretable\nsemantic concepts for time-series often rely on multiple factors instead of\nindividuals. To bridge the gap, we propose Disentangle Time Series (DTS), a\nnovel disentanglement enhancement framework for sequential data. Specifically,\nto generate hierarchical semantic concepts as the interpretable and\ndisentangled representation of time-series, DTS introduces multi-level\ndisentanglement strategies by covering both individual latent factors and group\nsemantic segments. We further theoretically show how to alleviate the KL\nvanishing problem: DTS introduces a mutual information maximization term, while\npreserving a heavier penalty on the total correlation and the dimension-wise KL\nto keep the disentanglement property. Experimental results on various\nreal-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the representations learned by\nDTS achieve superior performance in downstream applications, with high\ninterpretability of semantic concepts.",

Second, an accuracy assessment is done specifically for main crop\ntypes from farmers declarations from 6 EU member countries or regions totaling\n>3M parcels and 8.21 Mha. Finally, the crop areas derived by classification are\ncompared to the subnational (NUTS 2) area statistics reported by Eurostat. The\noverall accuracy for the map is reported as 80.3% when grouping main crop\nclasses and 76% when considering all 19 crop type classes separately.

The correlation between the remotely sensed\nestimated and Eurostat reported crop area ranges from 0.93 (potatoes) to 0.99\n(rape and turnip rape).

Hence, direct minimization of the Bellman error can\nresult in significantly biased Q-function estimates. We explain why fixing the\ntarget Q-network in Deep Q-Networks and Fitted Q Evaluation provides a way of\novercoming this confounding, thus shedding new light on this popular but not\nwell understood trick in the deep RL literature. An alternative approach to\naddress confounding is to leverage techniques developed in the causality\nliterature, notably instrumental variables (IV). We bring together here the\nliterature on IV and RL by investigating whether IV approaches can lead to\nimproved Q-function estimates. This paper analyzes and compares a wide range of\nrecent IV methods in the context of offline policy evaluation (OPE), where the\ngoal is to estimate the value of a policy using logged data only. By applying\ndifferent IV techniques to OPE, we are not only able to recover previously\nproposed OPE methods such as model-based techniques but also to obtain\ncompetitive new techniques. We find empirically that state-of-the-art OPE\nmethods are closely matched in performance by some IV methods such as AGMM,\nwhich were not developed for OPE.

          "description": "Reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to create a decision-making agent for\nautonomous driving. However, previous approaches provide only black-box\nsolutions, which do not offer information on how confident the agent is about\nits decisions. An estimate of both the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of\nthe agent's decisions is fundamental for real-world applications of autonomous\ndriving. Therefore, this paper introduces the Ensemble Quantile Networks (EQN)\nmethod, which combines distributional RL with an ensemble approach, to obtain a\ncomplete uncertainty estimate. The distribution over returns is estimated by\nlearning its quantile function implicitly, which gives the aleatoric\nuncertainty, whereas an ensemble of agents is trained on bootstrapped data to\nprovide a Bayesian estimation of the epistemic uncertainty. A criterion for\nclassifying which decisions that have an unacceptable uncertainty is also\nintroduced. The results show that the EQN method can balance risk and time\nefficiency in different occluded intersection scenarios, by considering the\nestimated aleatoric uncertainty. Furthermore, it is shown that the trained\nagent can use the epistemic uncertainty information to identify situations that\nthe agent has not been trained for and thereby avoid making unfounded,\npotentially dangerous, decisions outside of the training distribution.",

A delayed recognition leads to\npremature mortality due to progressive loss of kidney function. The employment\nof data mining to discover subtle patterns in CKD indicators would contribute\nto an early diagnosis. This work develops a classifier model that would support\nhealthcare professionals in the early diagnosis of CKD patients. Through a data\npipeline, an exhaustive search is performed to find the best data mining\nclassifier with different parameters of the data preparation's sub-stages like\ndata missing or feature selection. Therefore, Extra Trees is selected as the\nbest classifier with a 100% and 99% of accuracy with, respectively,\ncross-validation technique and with new unseen data.

          "description": "First-person object-interaction tasks in high-fidelity, 3D, simulated\nenvironments such as the AI2Thor virtual home-environment pose significant\nsample-efficiency challenges for reinforcement learning (RL) agents learning\nfrom sparse task rewards. To alleviate these challenges, prior work has\nprovided extensive supervision via a combination of reward-shaping,\nground-truth object-information, and expert demonstrations. In this work, we\nshow that one can learn object-interaction tasks from scratch without\nsupervision by learning an attentive object-model as an auxiliary task during\ntask learning with an object-centric relational RL agent. Our key insight is\nthat learning an object-model that incorporates object-attention into forward\nprediction provides a dense learning signal for unsupervised representation\nlearning of both objects and their relationships. This, in turn, enables faster\npolicy learning for an object-centric relational RL agent. We demonstrate our\nagent by introducing a set of challenging object-interaction tasks in the\nAI2Thor environment where learning with our attentive object-model is key to\nstrong performance. Specifically, we compare our agent and relational RL agents\nwith alternative auxiliary tasks to a relational RL agent equipped with\nground-truth object-information, and show that learning with our object-model\nbest closes the performance gap in terms of both learning speed and maximum\nsuccess rate. Additionally, we find that incorporating object-attention into an\nobject-model's forward predictions is key to learning representations which\ncapture object-category and object-state.",

          "description": "We present a simple and intuitive approach for interactive control of\nphysically simulated characters. Our work builds upon generative adversarial\nnetworks (GAN) and reinforcement learning, and introduces an imitation learning\nframework where an ensemble of classifiers and an imitation policy are trained\nin tandem given pre-processed reference clips. The classifiers are trained to\ndiscriminate the reference motion from the motion generated by the imitation\npolicy, while the policy is rewarded for fooling the discriminators. Using our\nGAN-based approach, multiple motor control policies can be trained separately\nto imitate different behaviors. In runtime, our system can respond to external\ncontrol signal provided by the user and interactively switch between different\npolicies. Compared to existing methods, our proposed approach has the following\nattractive properties: 1) achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance\nwithout manually designing and fine tuning a reward function; 2) directly\ncontrols the character without having to track any target reference pose\nexplicitly or implicitly through a phase state; and 3) supports interactive\npolicy switching without requiring any motion generation or motion matching\nmechanism. We highlight the applicability of our approach in a range of\nimitation and interactive control tasks, while also demonstrating its ability\nto withstand external perturbations as well as to recover balance. Overall, our\napproach generates high-fidelity motion, has low runtime cost, and can be\neasily integrated into interactive applications and games.",

          "description": "Pelvic ring disruptions result from blunt injury mechanisms and are often\nfound in patients with multi-system trauma. To grade pelvic fracture severity\nin trauma victims based on whole-body CT, the Tile AO/OTA classification is\nfrequently used. Due to the high volume of whole-body trauma CTs generated in\nbusy trauma centers, an automated approach to Tile classification would provide\nsubstantial value, e.,g., to prioritize the reading queue of the attending\ntrauma radiologist. In such scenario, an automated method should perform\ngrading based on a transparent process and based on interpretable features to\nenable interaction with human readers and lower their workload by offering\ninsights from a first automated read of the scan. This paper introduces an\nautomated yet interpretable pelvic trauma decision support system to assist\nradiologists in fracture detection and Tile grade classification. The method\noperates similarly to human interpretation of CT scans and first detects\ndistinct pelvic fractures on CT with high specificity using a Faster-RCNN model\nthat are then interpreted using a structural causal model based on clinical\nbest practices to infer an initial Tile grade. The Bayesian causal model and\nfinally, the object detector are then queried for likely co-occurring fractures\nthat may have been rejected initially due to the highly specific operating\npoint of the detector, resulting in an updated list of detected fractures and\ncorresponding final Tile grade. Our method is transparent in that it provides\nfinding location and type using the object detector, as well as information on\nimportant counterfactuals that would invalidate the system's recommendation and\nachieves an AUC of 83.3%/85.1% for translational/rotational instability.\nDespite being designed for human-machine teaming, our approach does not\ncompromise on performance compared to previous black-box approaches.",

          "description": "Federated Learning (FL) has shown great potential as a privacy-preserving\nsolution to learning from decentralized data which are only accessible locally\non end devices (i.e., clients). In many scenarios, however, a large proportion\nof the clients are probably in possession of low-quality data that are biased,\nnoisy or even irrelevant. As a result, they could significantly slow down the\nconvergence of the global model we aim to build and also compromise its\nquality. In light of this, we propose FedProf, a novel protocol for optimizing\nFL under such circumstances without breaching data privacy. The key of our\napproach is using the global model to dynamically profile the latent\nrepresentations of data (termed representation footprints) on the clients. By\nmatching local footprints on clients against a baseline footprint on the\nserver, we adaptively score each client and adjust its probability of being\nselected each round so as to mitigate the impact of the clients with\nlow-quality data on the training process. We have conducted extensive\nexperiments on public data sets using various FL settings. The results show\nthat FedProf effectively reduces the number of communication rounds and overall\ntime (providing up to 4.5x speedup) for the global model to converge while\nimproving the accuracy of the final global model.",

In this work, we propose multimodal\nknowledge expansion (MKE), a knowledge distillation-based framework to\neffectively utilize multimodal data without requiring labels. Opposite to\ntraditional knowledge distillation, where the student is designed to be\nlightweight and inferior to the teacher, we observe that a multimodal student\nmodel consistently denoises pseudo labels and generalizes better than its\nteacher. Extensive experiments on four tasks and different modalities verify\nthis finding. Furthermore, we connect the mechanism of MKE to semi-supervised\nlearning and offer both empirical and theoretical explanations to understand\nthe denoising capability of a multimodal student.",

          "description": "Deep learning (DL) has achieved unprecedented success in a variety of tasks.\nHowever, DL systems are notoriously difficult to test and debug due to the lack\nof explainability of DL models and the huge test input space to cover.\nGenerally speaking, it is relatively easy to collect a massive amount of test\ndata, but the labeling cost can be quite high. Consequently, it is essential to\nconduct test selection and label only those selected \"high quality\"\nbug-revealing test inputs for test cost reduction.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel test prioritization technique that brings\norder into the unlabeled test instances according to their bug-revealing\ncapabilities, namely TestRank. Different from existing solutions, TestRank\nleverages both intrinsic attributes and contextual attributes of test instances\nwhen prioritizing them. To be specific, we first build a similarity graph on\ntest instances and training samples, and we conduct graph-based semi-supervised\nlearning to extract contextual features. Then, for a particular test instance,\nthe contextual features extracted from the graph neural network (GNN) and the\nintrinsic features obtained with the DL model itself are combined to predict\nits bug-revealing probability. Finally, TestRank prioritizes unlabeled test\ninstances in descending order of the above probability value. We evaluate the\nperformance of TestRank on a variety of image classification datasets.\nExperimental results show that the debugging efficiency of our method\nsignificantly outperforms existing test prioritization techniques.",

As\nthe modules are physically re-configured, the policy automatically\nre-configures to match the kinematic structure.

With\nenvironments modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDP), most of the existing\nimitation algorithms are contingent on the availability of expert\ndemonstrations in the same MDP as the one in which a new imitation policy is to\nbe learned. In this paper, we study the problem of how to imitate tasks when\nthere exist discrepancies between the expert and agent MDP. These discrepancies\nacross domains could include differing dynamics, viewpoint, or morphology; we\npresent a novel framework to learn correspondences across such domains.\nImportantly, in contrast to prior works, we use unpaired and unaligned\ntrajectories containing only states in the expert domain, to learn this\ncorrespondence.

In addition, we enforce\nconsistency on the temporal position of states via a normalized position\nestimator function, to align the trajectories across the two domains.

However, VO$_2$\nmonitoring is largely limited to specialized laboratory settings, making its\nwidespread monitoring elusive. Here, we investigate temporal prediction of\nVO$_2$ from wearable sensors during cycle ergometer exercise using a temporal\nconvolutional network (TCN). Cardiorespiratory signals were acquired from a\nsmart shirt with integrated textile sensors alongside ground-truth VO$_2$ from\na metabolic system on twenty-two young healthy adults. Participants performed\none ramp-incremental and three pseudorandom binary sequence exercise protocols\nto assess a range of VO$_2$ dynamics. A TCN model was developed using causal\nconvolutions across an effective history length to model the time-dependent\nnature of VO$_2$. Optimal history length was determined through minimum\nvalidation loss across hyperparameter values. The best performing model encoded\n218 s history length (TCN-VO$_2$ A), with 187 s, 97 s, and 76 s yielding less\nthan 3% deviation from the optimal validation loss. TCN-VO$_2$ A showed strong\nprediction accuracy (mean, 95% CI) across all exercise intensities (-22\nml.min$^{-1}$, [-262, 218]), spanning transitions from low-moderate (-23\nml.min$^{-1}$, [-250, 204]), low-heavy (14 ml.min$^{-1}$, [-252, 280]),\nventilatory threshold-heavy (-49 ml.min$^{-1}$, [-274, 176]), and maximal (-32\nml.min$^{-1}$, [-261, 197]) exercise.

          "description": "In this work we study the problem of measuring the fairness of a machine\nlearning model under noisy information. Focusing on group fairness metrics, we\ninvestigate the particular but common situation when the evaluation requires\ncontrolling for the confounding effect of covariate variables. In a practical\nsetting, we might not be able to jointly observe the covariate and group\ninformation, and a standard workaround is to then use proxies for one or more\nof these variables. Prior works have demonstrated the challenges with using a\nproxy for sensitive attributes, and strong independence assumptions are needed\nto provide guarantees on the accuracy of the noisy estimates. In contrast, in\nthis work we study using a proxy for the covariate variable and present a\ntheoretical analysis that aims to characterize weaker conditions under which\naccurate fairness evaluation is possible.\n\nFurthermore, our theory identifies potential sources of errors and decouples\nthem into two interpretable parts $\\gamma$ and $\\epsilon$. The first part\n$\\gamma$ depends solely on the performance of the proxy such as precision and\nrecall, whereas the second part $\\epsilon$ captures correlations between all\nthe variables of interest. We show that in many scenarios the error in the\nestimates is dominated by $\\gamma$ via a linear dependence, whereas the\ndependence on the correlations $\\epsilon$ only constitutes a lower order term.\nAs a result we expand the understanding of scenarios where measuring model\nfairness via proxies can be an effective approach. Finally, we compare, via\nsimulations, the theoretical upper-bounds to the distribution of simulated\nestimation errors and show that assuming some structure on the data, even weak,\nis key to significantly improve both theoretical guarantees and empirical\nresults.",

In this\npaper, we establish an $\\Omega(H^2 S/d_m\\epsilon^2)$ lower bound (over\nmodel-based family) for the global uniform OPE, where $d_m$ is the minimal\nstate-action probability induced by the behavior policy. Next, our main result\nestablishes an episode complexity of $\\tilde{O}(H^2/d_m\\epsilon^2)$ for\n\\emph{local} uniform convergence that applies to all \\emph{near-empirically\noptimal} policies for the MDPs with \\emph{stationary} transition. This result\nimplies the optimal sample complexity for offline learning and separates the\nlocal uniform OPE from the global case due to the extra $S$ factor.\nParamountly, the model-based method combining with our new analysis technique\n(singleton absorbing MDP) can be adapted to the new settings: offline\ntask-agnostic and the offline reward-free with optimal complexity\n$\\tilde{O}(H^2\\log(K)/d_m\\epsilon^2)$ ($K$ is the number of tasks) and\n$\\tilde{O}(H^2S/d_m\\epsilon^2)$ respectively, which provides a unified\nframework for simultaneously solving different offline RL problems.",

The target measure is\ngenerated via a deterministic gradient descent algorithm, so as to match a set\nof statistics of the given, observed realization. Our statistics are estimators\nof the multi-scale wavelet phase harmonic covariance, recently proposed in\nimage modeling.

A Parallel and Distributed\nComputing (or PDC) scheme, termed Federated Learning (FL), has emerged as a new\nparadigm to cope with the privacy issue by allowing clients to perform model\ntraining locally, without the necessity to upload their personal sensitive\ndata. In FL, the number of clients could be sufficiently large, but the\nbandwidth available for model distribution and re-upload is quite limited,\nmaking it sensible to only involve part of the volunteers to participate in the\ntraining process. The client selection policy is critical to an FL process in\nterms of training efficiency, the final model's quality as well as fairness. In\nthis paper, we will model the fairness guaranteed client selection as a\nLyapunov optimization problem and then a C2MAB-based method is proposed for\nestimation of the model exchange time between each client and the server, based\non which we design a fairness guaranteed algorithm termed RBCS-F for\nproblem-solving. The regret of RBCS-F is strictly bounded by a finite constant,\njustifying its theoretical feasibility.

          "description": "Constraint-based methods are one of the main approaches for causal structure\nlearning that are particularly valued as they are asymptotically guaranteed to\nfind a structure that is Markov equivalent to the causal graph of the system.\nOn the other hand, they may require an exponentially large number of\nconditional independence (CI) tests in the number of variables of the system.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel recursive constraint-based method for causal\nstructure learning that significantly reduces the required number of CI tests\ncompared to the existing literature. The idea of the proposed approach is to\nuse Markov boundary information to identify a specific variable that can be\nremoved from the set of variables without affecting the statistical\ndependencies among the other variables. Having identified such a variable, we\ndiscover its neighborhood, remove that variable from the set of variables, and\nrecursively learn the causal structure over the remaining variables. We further\nprovide a lower bound on the number of CI tests required by any\nconstraint-based method. Comparing this lower bound to our achievable bound\ndemonstrates the efficiency of the proposed approach. Our experimental results\nshow that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art both on synthetic\nand real-world structures.",

Existing approaches are usually guided by the test coverage criteria,\ngenerating synthetic test cases that are often difficult for developers to read\nor understand. In this paper we propose AthenaTest, an approach that aims to\ngenerate unit test cases by learning from real-world focal methods and\ndeveloper-written testcases. We formulate unit test case generation as a\nsequence-to-sequence learning task, adopting a two-step training procedure\nconsisting of denoising pretraining on a large unsupervised Java corpus, and\nsupervised finetuning for a downstream translation task of generating unit\ntests. We investigate the impact of natural language and source code\npretraining, as well as the focal context information surrounding the focal\nmethod. Both techniques provide improvements in terms of validation loss, with\npretraining yielding 25% relative improvement and focal context providing\nadditional 11.1% improvement. We also introduce Methods2Test, the largest\npublicly available supervised parallel corpus of unit test case methods and\ncorresponding focal methods in Java, which comprises 780K test cases mined from\n91K open-source repositories from GitHub. We evaluate AthenaTest on five\ndefects4j projects, generating 25K passing test cases covering 43.7% of the\nfocal methods with only 30 attempts. We execute the test cases, collect test\ncoverage information, and compare them with test cases generated by EvoSuite\nand GPT-3, finding that our approach outperforms GPT-3 and has comparable\ncoverage w.r.t.

However, the existing low-memory BLS implementation sacrifices the\ntesting accuracy as a price for efficient usage of memories, since it can no\nlonger obtain the generalized inverse or ridge solution for the output weights\nduring incremental learning, and it cannot work under the very small ridge\nparameter that is utilized in the original BLS. Accordingly, it is required to\ndevelop the low-memory BLS implementations, which can work under very small\nridge parameters and compute the generalized inverse or ridge solution for the\noutput weights in the process of incremental learning. In this paper, firstly\nwe propose the low-memory implementations for the recently proposed recursive\nand square-root BLS algorithms on added inputs and the recently proposed\nsquareroot BLS algorithm on added nodes, by simply processing a batch of inputs\nor nodes in each recursion. Since the recursive BLS implementation includes the\nrecursive updates of the inverse matrix that may introduce numerical\ninstabilities after a large number of iterations, and needs the extra\ncomputational load to decompose the inverse matrix into the Cholesky factor\nwhen cooperating with the proposed low-memory implementation of the square-root\nBLS algorithm on added nodes, we only improve the low-memory implementations of\nthe square-root BLS algorithms on added inputs and nodes, to propose the full\nlowmemory implementation of the square-root BLS algorithm.

The\nvariable at the beginning of such a path is referred to as an ancestor of the\nvariable at the end of the path. Ancestral relations between variables play an\nimportant role in causal modeling. In existing literature on structure\nlearning, these relations are usually deduced from learned structures and used\nfor orienting edges or formulating constraints of the space of possible DAGs.\nHowever, they are usually not posed as immediate target of inference.

          "description": "Train machine learning models on sensitive user data has raised increasing\nprivacy concerns in many areas. Federated learning is a popular approach for\nprivacy protection that collects the local gradient information instead of real\ndata. One way to achieve a strict privacy guarantee is to apply local\ndifferential privacy into federated learning. However, previous works do not\ngive a practical solution due to three issues. First, the noisy data is close\nto its original value with high probability, increasing the risk of information\nexposure. Second, a large variance is introduced to the estimated average,\ncausing poor accuracy. Last, the privacy budget explodes due to the high\ndimensionality of weights in deep learning models. In this paper, we proposed a\nnovel design of local differential privacy mechanism for federated learning to\naddress the abovementioned issues. It is capable of making the data more\ndistinct from its original value and introducing lower variance. Moreover, the\nproposed mechanism bypasses the curse of dimensionality by splitting and\nshuffling model updates. A series of empirical evaluations on three commonly\nused datasets, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10, demonstrate that our solution\ncan not only achieve superior deep learning performance but also provide a\nstrong privacy guarantee at the same time.",

          "description": "In this paper, we consider hybrid parallelism -- a paradigm that employs both\nData Parallelism (DP) and Model Parallelism (MP) -- to scale distributed\ntraining of large recommendation models. We propose a compression framework\ncalled Dynamic Communication Thresholding (DCT) for communication-efficient\nhybrid training. DCT filters the entities to be communicated across the network\nthrough a simple hard-thresholding function, allowing only the most relevant\ninformation to pass through. For communication efficient DP, DCT compresses the\nparameter gradients sent to the parameter server during model synchronization.\nThe threshold is updated only once every few thousand iterations to reduce the\ncomputational overhead of compression. For communication efficient MP, DCT\nincorporates a novel technique to compress the activations and gradients sent\nacross the network during the forward and backward propagation, respectively.\nThis is done by identifying and updating only the most relevant neurons of the\nneural network for each training sample in the data. We evaluate DCT on\npublicly available natural language processing and recommender models and\ndatasets, as well as recommendation systems used in production at Facebook. DCT\nreduces communication by at least $100\\times$ and $20\\times$ during DP and MP,\nrespectively.

However, methods used for this task assume the availability\nof complete and unambiguous labelmaps, with instance boundaries of objects, and\nclass labels for each pixel. This reliance on heavily annotated inputs\nrestricts the application of image synthesis techniques to real-world\napplications, especially under uncertainty due to weather, occlusion, or noise.\nOn the other hand, algorithms that can synthesize images from sparse labelmaps\nor sketches are highly desirable as tools that can guide content creators and\nartists to quickly generate scenes by simply specifying locations of a few\nobjects. In this paper, we address the problem of complex scene completion from\nsparse labelmaps. Under this setting, very few details about the scene (30\\% of\nobject instances) are available as input for image synthesis. We propose a\ntwo-stage deep network based method, called `Halluci-Net', that learns\nco-occurence relationships between objects in scenes, and then exploits these\nrelationships to produce a dense and complete labelmap. The generated dense\nlabelmap can then be used as input by state-of-the-art image synthesis\ntechniques like pix2pixHD to obtain the final image. The proposed method is\nevaluated on the Cityscapes dataset and it outperforms two baselines methods on\nperformance metrics like Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID), semantic\nsegmentation accuracy, and similarity in object co-occurrences.

          "description": "This paper introduces Non-Autonomous Input-Output Stable Network(NAIS-Net), a\nvery deep architecture where each stacked processing block is derived from a\ntime-invariant non-autonomous dynamical system. Non-autonomy is implemented by\nskip connections from the block input to each of the unrolled processing stages\nand allows stability to be enforced so that blocks can be unrolled adaptively\nto a pattern-dependent processing depth. NAIS-Net induces non-trivial,\nLipschitz input-output maps, even for an infinite unroll length. We prove that\nthe network is globally asymptotically stable so that for every initial\ncondition there is exactly one input-dependent equilibrium assuming $tanh$\nunits, and incrementally stable for ReL units. An efficient implementation that\nenforces the stability under derived conditions for both fully-connected and\nconvolutional layers is also presented. Experimental results show how NAIS-Net\nexhibits stability in practice, yielding a significant reduction in\ngeneralization gap compared to ResNets.",

With the recent success of deep\nlearning methods, recent work on SISR focuses solutions with deep learning\nmethodologies and achieves state-of-the-art results. However most of the\nstate-of-the-art SISR methods contain millions of parameters and layers, which\nlimits their practical applications. In this paper, we propose a hardware\n(Synaptics Dolphin NPU) limitation aware, extremely lightweight quantization\nrobust real-time super resolution network (XLSR).

Unfortunately, these methods are\ncompute-demanding and memory-intensive.

We compare four\nsupervised learning techniques on different classification scenarios and\ncharacterize the overall NILM pipeline's implementation on a MCU-based Smart\nMeasurement Node. Experimental results demonstrate that optimizing the feature\nspace enables edge MCU-based NILM with 95.15% accuracy, resulting in a small\ndrop compared to the most-accurate feature vector deployment (96.19%) while\nachieving up to 5.45x speed-up and 80.56% storage reduction.

However,\nthe most popular inference algorithms for SBL become too expensive for\nhigh-dimensional problems due to the need to maintain a large covariance\nmatrix. To resolve this issue, we introduce a new SBL inference algorithm that\navoids explicit computation of the covariance matrix, thereby saving\nsignificant time and space. Instead of performing costly matrix inversions, our\ncovariance-free method solves multiple linear systems to obtain provably\nunbiased estimates of the posterior statistics needed by SBL. These systems can\nbe solved in parallel, enabling further acceleration of the algorithm via\ngraphics processing units. In practice, our method can be up to thousands of\ntimes faster than existing baselines, reducing hours of computation time to\nseconds. We showcase how our new algorithm enables SBL to tractably tackle\nhigh-dimensional signal recovery problems, such as deconvolution of calcium\nimaging data and multi-contrast reconstruction of magnetic resonance images.\nFinally, we open-source a toolbox containing all of our implementations to\ndrive future research in SBL.",

These models are based on multi-head\nself-attention mechanisms that can flexibly attend to a sequence of image\npatches to encode contextual cues. An important question is how such\nflexibility in attending image-wide context conditioned on a given patch can\nfacilitate handling nuisances in natural images e.g., severe occlusions, domain\nshifts, spatial permutations, adversarial and natural perturbations. We\nsystematically study this question via an extensive set of experiments\nencompassing three ViT families and comparisons with a high-performing\nconvolutional neural network (CNN). We show and analyze the following\nintriguing properties of ViT: (a) Transformers are highly robust to severe\nocclusions, perturbations and domain shifts, e.g., retain as high as 60% top-1\naccuracy on ImageNet even after randomly occluding 80% of the image content.\n(b) The robust performance to occlusions is not due to a bias towards local\ntextures, and ViTs are significantly less biased towards textures compared to\nCNNs. When properly trained to encode shape-based features, ViTs demonstrate\nshape recognition capability comparable to that of human visual system,\npreviously unmatched in the literature. (c) Using ViTs to encode shape\nrepresentation leads to an interesting consequence of accurate semantic\nsegmentation without pixel-level supervision. (d) Off-the-shelf features from a\nsingle ViT model can be combined to create a feature ensemble, leading to high\naccuracy rates across a range of classification datasets in both traditional\nand few-shot learning paradigms.

          "description": "The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect phishing emails is\nprimarily dependent on large-scale centralized datasets, which opens it up to a\nmyriad of privacy, trust, and legal issues. Moreover, organizations are loathed\nto share emails, given the risk of leakage of commercially sensitive\ninformation. So, it is uncommon to obtain sufficient emails to train a global\nAI model efficiently. Accordingly, privacy-preserving distributed and\ncollaborative machine learning, particularly Federated Learning (FL), is a\ndesideratum. Already prevalent in the healthcare sector, questions remain\nregarding the effectiveness and efficacy of FL-based phishing detection within\nthe context of multi-organization collaborations. To the best of our knowledge,\nthe work herein is the first to investigate the use of FL in email\nanti-phishing. This paper builds upon a deep neural network model, particularly\nRNN and BERT for phishing email detection. It analyzes the FL-entangled\nlearning performance under various settings, including balanced and\nasymmetrical data distribution. Our results corroborate comparable performance\nstatistics of FL in phishing email detection to centralized learning for\nbalanced datasets, and low organization counts. Moreover, we observe a\nvariation in performance when increasing organizational counts. For a fixed\ntotal email dataset, the global RNN based model suffers by a 1.8% accuracy drop\nwhen increasing organizational counts from 2 to 10. In contrast, BERT accuracy\nrises by 0.6% when going from 2 to 5 organizations. However, if we allow\nincreasing the overall email dataset with the introduction of new organizations\nin the FL framework, the organizational level performance is improved by\nachieving a faster convergence speed. Besides, FL suffers in its overall global\nmodel performance due to highly unstable outputs if the email dataset\ndistribution is highly asymmetric.",

          "description": "Over the last few years, we have seen increasing data generated from\nnon-Euclidean domains, which are usually represented as graphs with complex\nrelationships, and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have gained a high interest\nbecause of their potential in processing graph-structured data. In particular,\nthere is a strong interest in exploring the possibilities in performing\nconvolution on graphs using an extension of the GNN architecture, generally\nreferred to as Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN). Convolution on\ngraphs has been achieved mainly in two forms: spectral and spatial\nconvolutions. Due to the higher flexibility in exploring and exploiting the\ngraph structure of data, recently, there is an increasing interest in\ninvestigating the possibilities that the spatial approach can offer. The idea\nof finding a way to adapt the network behaviour to the inputs they process to\nmaximize the total performances has aroused much interest in the neural\nnetworks literature over the years. This paper presents a novel method to adapt\nthe behaviour of a GCNN to the input proposing two ways to perform spatial\nconvolution on graphs using input-based filters which are dynamically\ngenerated. Our model also investigates the problem of discovering and refining\nrelations among nodes. The experimental assessment confirms the capabilities of\nthe proposed approach, which achieves satisfying results using simple\narchitectures with a low number of filters.",

          "description": "In this work, we propose a data-driven scheme to initialize the parameters of\na deep neural network. This is in contrast to traditional approaches which\nrandomly initialize parameters by sampling from transformed standard\ndistributions. Such methods do not use the training data to produce a more\ninformed initialization. Our method uses a sequential layer-wise approach where\neach layer is initialized using its input activations. The initialization is\ncast as an optimization problem where we minimize a combination of encoding and\ndecoding losses of the input activations, which is further constrained by a\nuser-defined latent code. The optimization problem is then restructured into\nthe well-known Sylvester equation, which has fast and efficient gradient-free\nsolutions. Our data-driven method achieves a boost in performance compared to\nrandom initialization methods, both before start of training and after training\nis over. We show that our proposed method is especially effective in few-shot\nand fine-tuning settings.

          "description": "Random Forest (RFs) are among the most widely used Machine Learning (ML)\nclassifiers. Even though RFs are not interpretable, there are no dedicated\nnon-heuristic approaches for computing explanations of RFs. Moreover, there is\nrecent work on polynomial algorithms for explaining ML models, including naive\nBayes classifiers. Hence, one question is whether finding explanations of RFs\ncan be solved in polynomial time. This paper answers this question negatively,\nby proving that computing one PI-explanation of an RF is D^P-complete.\nFurthermore, the paper proposes a propositional encoding for computing\nexplanations of RFs, thus enabling finding PI-explanations with a SAT solver.\nThis contrasts with earlier work on explaining boosted trees (BTs) and neural\nnetworks (NNs), which requires encodings based on SMT/MILP. Experimental\nresults, obtained on a wide range of publicly available datasets, demontrate\nthat the proposed SAT-based approach scales to RFs of sizes common in practical\napplications. Perhaps more importantly, the experimental results demonstrate\nthat, for the vast majority of examples considered, the SAT-based approach\nproposed in this paper significantly outperforms existing heuristic approaches.",

Probes are often designed\nfor simplicity, which has led to restrictions on probe design that may not\nallow for the full exploitation of the structure of encoded information; one\nsuch restriction is linearity. We examine the case of a structural probe\n(Hewitt and Manning, 2019), which aims to investigate the encoding of syntactic\nstructure in contextual representations through learning only linear\ntransformations. By observing that the structural probe learns a metric, we are\nable to kernelize it and develop a novel non-linear variant with an identical\nnumber of parameters. We test on 6 languages and find that the radial-basis\nfunction (RBF) kernel, in conjunction with regularization, achieves a\nstatistically significant improvement over the baseline in all languages --\nimplying that at least part of the syntactic knowledge is encoded non-linearly.\nWe conclude by discussing how the RBF kernel resembles BERT's self-attention\nlayers and speculate that this resemblance leads to the RBF-based probe's\nstronger performance.",

The labels were given\nto paroxysmal discharges visually observed in both ictal (seizure) and\ninterictal (nonseizure) intervals. Results showed that the mEEGNet detected\nabnormal EEGs with the area under the curve, F1-values, and sensitivity\nequivalent to or higher than those of existing CNNs.

          "description": "Knowledge Graphs (KG) and associated Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models\nhave recently begun to be explored in the context of drug discovery and have\nthe potential to assist in key challenges such as target identification. In the\ndrug discovery domain, KGs can be employed as part of a process which can\nresult in lab-based experiments being performed, or impact on other decisions,\nincurring significant time and financial costs and most importantly, ultimately\ninfluencing patient healthcare. For KGE models to have impact in this domain, a\nbetter understanding of not only of performance, but also the various factors\nwhich determine it, is required.\n\nIn this study we investigate, over the course of many thousands of\nexperiments, the predictive performance of five KGE models on two public drug\ndiscovery-oriented KGs. Our goal is not to focus on the best overall model or\nconfiguration, instead we take a deeper look at how performance can be affected\nby changes in the training setup, choice of hyperparameters, model parameter\ninitialisation seed and different splits of the datasets. Our results highlight\nthat these factors have significant impact on performance and can even affect\nthe ranking of models. Indeed these factors should be reported along with model\narchitectures to ensure complete reproducibility and fair comparisons of future\nwork, and we argue this is critical for the acceptance of use, and impact of\nKGEs in a biomedical setting.

It has\nbeen experimentally shown that HOE can obtain representations of hierarchical\ndata such as a knowledge base and a citation network effectively, owing to\nhyperbolic space's exponential growth property. However, its theoretical\nanalysis has been limited to ideal noiseless settings, and its generalization\nerror in compensation for hyperbolic space's exponential representation ability\nhas not been guaranteed. The difficulty is that existing generalization error\nbound derivations for ordinal embedding based on the Gramian matrix do not work\nin HOE, since hyperbolic space is not inner-product space. In this paper,\nthrough our novel characterization of HOE with decomposed Lorentz Gramian\nmatrices, we provide a generalization error bound of HOE for the first time,\nwhich is at most exponential with respect to the embedding space's radius. Our\ncomparison between the bounds of HOE and Euclidean ordinal embedding shows that\nHOE's generalization error is reasonable as a cost for its exponential\nrepresentation ability.",

          "description": "Robotic manipulation of cloth remains challenging for robotics due to the\ncomplex dynamics of the cloth, lack of a low-dimensional state representation,\nand self-occlusions. In contrast to previous model-based approaches that learn\na pixel-based dynamics model or a compressed latent vector dynamics, we propose\nto learn a particle-based dynamics model from a partial point cloud\nobservation. To overcome the challenges of partial observability, we infer\nwhich visible points are connected on the underlying cloth mesh. We then learn\na dynamics model over this visible connectivity graph. Compared to previous\nlearning-based approaches, our model poses strong inductive bias with its\nparticle based representation for learning the underlying cloth physics; it is\ninvariant to visual features; and the predictions can be more easily\nvisualized. We show that our method greatly outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art model-based and model-free reinforcement learning methods in\nsimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer where we\ndeploy the model trained in simulation on a Franka arm and show that the model\ncan successfully smooth different types of cloth from crumpled configurations.\nVideos can be found on our project website.",

          "description": "In intelligent transportation system, the key problem of traffic forecasting\nis how to extract the periodic temporal dependencies and complex spatial\ncorrelation. Current state-of-the-art methods for traffic flow prediction are\nbased on graph architectures and sequence learning models, but they do not\nfully exploit spatial-temporal dynamic information in traffic system.\nSpecifically, the temporal dependence of short-range is diluted by recurrent\nneural networks, and existing sequence model ignores local spatial information\nbecause the convolution operation uses global average pooling. Besides, there\nwill be some traffic accidents during the transitions of objects causing\ncongestion in the real world that trigger increased prediction deviation. To\novercome these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Conv-sequence\nLearning (STCL), in which a focused temporal block uses unidirectional\nconvolution to effectively capture short-term periodic temporal dependence, and\na spatial-temporal fusion module is able to extract the dependencies of both\ninteractions and decrease the feature dimensions. Moreover, the accidents\nfeatures impact on local traffic congestion and position encoding is employed\nto detect anomalies in complex traffic situations.

          "description": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained using stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD)-based optimizers. Recently, the adaptive moment estimation (Adam)\noptimizer has become very popular due to its adaptive momentum, which tackles\nthe dying gradient problem of SGD. Nevertheless, existing optimizers are still\nunable to exploit the optimization curvature information efficiently. This\npaper proposes a new AngularGrad optimizer that considers the behavior of the\ndirection/angle of consecutive gradients. This is the first attempt in the\nliterature to exploit the gradient angular information apart from its\nmagnitude. The proposed AngularGrad generates a score to control the step size\nbased on the gradient angular information of previous iterations. Thus, the\noptimization steps become smoother as a more accurate step size of immediate\npast gradients is captured through the angular information. Two variants of\nAngularGrad are developed based on the use of Tangent or Cosine functions for\ncomputing the gradient angular information. Theoretically, AngularGrad exhibits\nthe same regret bound as Adam for convergence purposes. Nevertheless, extensive\nexperiments conducted on benchmark data sets against state-of-the-art methods\nreveal a superior performance of AngularGrad.

In this paper, we calculated the Hessian and visualized\nthe loss landscape of variational quantum classifiers at different points in\nparameter space. The curvature information of variational quantum classifiers\n(VQC) is interpreted and the loss function's convergence is shown. It helps us\nbetter understand the behavior of variational quantum circuits to tackle\noptimization problems efficiently. We investigated the variational quantum\nclassifiers via Hessian on quantum computers, started with a simple 4-bit\nparity problem to gain insight into the practical behavior of Hessian, then\nthoroughly analyzed the behavior of Hessian's eigenvalues on training the\nvariational quantum classifier for the Diabetes dataset.",

          "description": "Modeling powerful interactions is a critical challenge in Click-through rate\n(CTR) prediction, which is one of the most typical machine learning tasks in\npersonalized advertising and recommender systems. Although developing\nhand-crafted interactions is effective for a small number of datasets, it\ngenerally requires laborious and tedious architecture engineering for extensive\nscenarios. In recent years, several neural architecture search (NAS) methods\nhave been proposed for designing interactions automatically. However, existing\nmethods only explore limited types and connections of operators for interaction\ngeneration, leading to low generalization ability. To address these problems,\nwe propose a more general automated method for building powerful interactions\nnamed AutoPI. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: AutoPI\nadopts a more general search space in which the computational graph is\ngeneralized from existing network connections, and the interactive operators in\nthe edges of the graph are extracted from representative hand-crafted works. It\nallows searching for various powerful feature interactions to produce higher\nAUC and lower Logloss in a wide variety of applications. Besides, AutoPI\nutilizes a gradient-based search strategy for exploration with a significantly\nlow computational cost. Experimentally, we evaluate AutoPI on a diverse suite\nof benchmark datasets, demonstrating the generalizability and efficiency of\nAutoPI over hand-crafted architectures and state-of-the-art NAS algorithms.",

          "description": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction plays an important role in many\nindustrial applications, and recently a lot of attention is paid to the deep\ninterest models which use attention mechanism to capture user interests from\nhistorical behaviors. However, most current models are based on sequential\nmodels which truncate the behavior sequences by a fixed length, thus have\ndifficulties in handling very long behavior sequences. Another big problem is\nthat sequences with the same length can be quite different in terms of time,\ncarrying completely different meanings. In this paper, we propose a\nnon-sequential approach to tackle the above problems. Specifically, we first\nrepresent the behavior data in a sparse key-vector format, where the vector\ncontains rich behavior info such as time, count and category. Next, we enhance\nthe Deep Interest Network to take such rich information into account by a novel\nattention network. The sparse representation makes it practical to handle large\nscale long behavior sequences. Finally, we introduce a multidimensional\npartition framework to mine behavior interactions. The framework can partition\ndata into custom designed time buckets to capture the interactions among\ninformation aggregated in different time buckets. Similarly, it can also\npartition the data into different categories and capture the interactions among\nthem. Experiments are conducted on two public datasets: one is an advertising\ndataset and the other is a production recommender dataset. Our models\noutperform other state-of-the-art models on both datasets.",

          "description": "Users' clicks on Web search results are one of the key signals for evaluating\nand improving web search quality and have been widely used as part of current\nstate-of-the-art Learning-To-Rank(LTR) models. With a large volume of search\nlogs available for major search engines, effective models of searcher click\nbehavior have emerged to evaluate and train LTR models. However, when modeling\nthe users' click behavior, considering the bias of the behavior is imperative.\nIn particular, when a search result is not clicked, it is not necessarily\nchosen as not relevant by the user, but instead could have been simply missed,\nespecially for lower-ranked results. These kinds of biases in the click log\ndata can be incorporated into the click models, propagating the errors to the\nresulting LTR ranking models or evaluation metrics. In this paper, we propose\nthe De-biased Reinforcement Learning Click model (DRLC). The DRLC model relaxes\npreviously made assumptions about the users' examination behavior and resulting\nlatent states. To implement the DRLC model, convolutional neural networks are\nused as the value networks for reinforcement learning, trained to learn a\npolicy to reduce bias in the click logs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe DRLC model, we first compare performance with the previous state-of-art\napproaches using established click prediction metrics, including log-likelihood\nand perplexity. We further show that DRLC also leads to improvements in ranking\nperformance. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRLC model in\nlearning to reduce bias in click logs, leading to improved modeling performance\nand showing the potential for using DRLC for improving Web search quality.",

          "description": "The performance of a cross-sectional currency strategy depends crucially on\naccurately ranking instruments prior to portfolio construction. While this\nranking step is traditionally performed using heuristics, or by sorting outputs\nproduced by pointwise regression or classification models, Learning to Rank\nalgorithms have recently presented themselves as competitive and viable\nalternatives. Despite improving ranking accuracy on average however, these\ntechniques do not account for the possibility that assets positioned at the\nextreme ends of the ranked list -- which are ultimately used to construct the\nlong/short portfolios -- can assume different distributions in the input space,\nand thus lead to sub-optimal strategy performance. Drawing from research in\nInformation Retrieval that demonstrates the utility of contextual information\nembedded within top-ranked documents to learn the query's characteristics to\nimprove ranking, we propose an analogous approach: exploiting the features of\nboth out- and under-performing instruments to learn a model for refining the\noriginal ranked list. Under a re-ranking framework, we adapt the Transformer\narchitecture to encode the features of extreme assets for refining our\nselection of long/short instruments obtained with an initial retrieval.\nBacktesting on a set of 31 currencies, our proposed methodology significantly\nboosts Sharpe ratios -- by approximately 20% over the original LTR algorithms\nand double that of traditional baselines.",

          "description": "To support complex search tasks, where the initial information requirements\nare complex or may change during the search, a search engine must adapt the\ninformation delivery as the user's information requirements evolve. To support\nthis dynamic ranking paradigm effectively, search result ranking must\nincorporate both the user feedback received, and the information displayed so\nfar. To address this problem, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning-based\napproach, RLIrank. We first build an adapted reinforcement learning framework\nto integrate the key components of the dynamic search. Then, we implement a new\nLearning to Rank (LTR) model for each iteration of the dynamic search, using a\nrecurrent Long Short Term Memory neural network (LSTM), which estimates the\ngain for each next result, learning from each previously ranked document. To\nincorporate the user's feedback, we develop a word-embedding variation of the\nclassic Rocchio Algorithm, to help guide the ranking towards the high-value\ndocuments. Those innovations enable RLIrank to outperform the previously\nreported methods from the TREC Dynamic Domain Tracks 2017 and exceed all the\nmethods in 2016 TREC Dynamic Domain after multiple search iterations, advancing\nthe state of the art for dynamic search.",

However, automatic localization of RFID-tagged goods in stores is still\na challenging problem. To address this issue, we equip fixtures (e.g., shelves)\nwith reference tags and use data we collect during RFID-based stocktakes to map\narticles to fixtures. Knowing the location of goods enables the implementation\nof several practical applications, such as automated Money Mapping (i.e., a\nheat map of sales across fixtures). Specifically, we conduct controlled lab\nexperiments and a case-study in two fashion retail stores to evaluate our\narticle-to-fixture prediction approaches. The approaches are based on\ncalculating distances between read event time series using DTW, and clustering\nof read events using DBSCAN. We find that, read events collected during\nRFID-based stocktakes can be used to assign articles to fixtures with an\naccuracy of more than 90%. Additionally, we conduct a pilot to investigate the\nchallenges related to the integration of such a localization system in the\nday-to-day business of retail stores.

          "description": "Recommender systems (RSs) are software tools and algorithms developed to\nalleviate the problem of information overload, which makes it difficult for a\nuser to make right decisions. Two main paradigms toward the recommendation\nproblem are collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, which try to\nrecommend the best items using ratings and content available. These methods\ntypically face infamous problems including cold-start, diversity, scalability,\nand great computational expense. We argue that the uptake of deep learning and\nreinforcement learning methods is also questionable due to their computational\ncomplexities and uninterpretability. In this paper, we approach the\nrecommendation problem from a new prospective. We borrow ideas from cluster\nhead selection algorithms in wireless sensor networks and adapt them to the\nrecommendation problem. In particular, we propose Load Balanced Recommender\nSystem (LBRS), which uses a probabilistic scheme for item recommendation.\nFurthermore, we factor in the importance of items in the recommendation\nprocess, which significantly improves the recommendation accuracy. We also\nintroduce a method that considers a heterogeneity among items, in order to\nbalance the similarity and diversity trade-off. Finally, we propose a new\nmetric for diversity, which emphasizes the importance of diversity not only\nfrom an intra-list perspective, but also from a between-list point of view.\nWith experiments in a simulation study performed on RecSim, we show that LBRS\nis effective and can outperform baseline methods.",

A major\ndrawback of this approach is high query latency due to the cost of evaluating\nevery passage in the document with BERT. To make matters worse, this high\ninference cost and latency varies based on the length of the…",
