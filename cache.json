          "description": "Multimodal pre-training with text, layout, and image has achieved SOTA\nperformance for visually-rich document understanding tasks recently, which\ndemonstrates the great potential for joint learning across different\nmodalities. In this paper, we present LayoutXLM, a multimodal pre-trained model\nfor multilingual document understanding, which aims to bridge the language\nbarriers for visually-rich document understanding. To accurately evaluate\nLayoutXLM, we also introduce a multilingual form understanding benchmark\ndataset named XFUND, which includes form understanding samples in 7 languages\n(Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese), and\nkey-value pairs are manually labeled for each language. Experiment results show\nthat the LayoutXLM model has significantly outperformed the existing SOTA\ncross-lingual pre-trained models on the XFUND dataset. The pre-trained\nLayoutXLM model and the XFUND dataset are publicly available at\nhttps://aka.ms/layoutxlm.",

          "description": "Most existing NER methods rely on extensive labeled data for model training,\nwhich struggles in the low-resource scenarios with limited training data.\nRecently, prompt-tuning methods for pre-trained language models have achieved\nremarkable performance in few-shot learning by exploiting prompts as task\nguidance to reduce the gap between training progress and downstream tuning.\nInspired by prompt learning, we propose a novel lightweight generative\nframework with prompt-guided attention for low-resource NER (LightNER).\nSpecifically, we construct the semantic-aware answer space of entity categories\nfor prompt learning to generate the entity span sequence and entity categories\nwithout any label-specific classifiers. We further propose prompt-guided\nattention by incorporating continuous prompts into the self-attention layer to\nre-modulate the attention and adapt pre-trained weights. Note that we only tune\nthose continuous prompts with the whole parameter of the pre-trained language\nmodel fixed, thus, making our approach lightweight and flexible for\nlow-resource scenarios and can better transfer knowledge across domains.\nExperimental results show that LightNER can obtain comparable performance in\nthe standard supervised setting and outperform strong baselines in low-resource\nsettings by tuning only a small part of the parameters.",

          "description": "In this work, we introduce back-training, an alternative to self-training for\nunsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) from source to target domain. While\nself-training generates synthetic training data where natural inputs are\naligned with noisy outputs, back-training results in natural outputs aligned\nwith noisy inputs. This significantly reduces the gap between the target domain\nand synthetic data distribution, and reduces model overfitting to the source\ndomain. We run UDA experiments on question generation and passage retrieval\nfrom the \\textit{Natural Questions} domain to machine learning and biomedical\ndomains. We find that back-training vastly outperforms self-training by a mean\nimprovement of 7.8 BLEU-4 points on generation, and 17.6\\% top-20 retrieval\naccuracy across both domains. We further propose consistency filters to remove\nlow-quality synthetic data before training.

          "description": "Recently, prompt-tuning has achieved promising results for certain few-shot\nclassification tasks. The core idea of prompt-tuning is to insert text pieces\n(i.e., templates) into the input and transform a classification task into a\nmasked language modeling problem. However, for relation extraction, determining\nan appropriate prompt template requires domain expertise, and it is cumbersome\nand time-consuming to obtain a suitable label word. Furthermore, there exist\nabundant semantic knowledge among the entities and relations that cannot be\nignored. To this end, we focus on incorporating knowledge into prompt-tuning\nfor relation extraction and propose a knowledge-aware prompt-tuning approach\nwith synergistic optimization (KnowPrompt). Specifically, we inject entity and\nrelation knowledge into prompt construction with learnable virtual template\nwords as well as answer words and synergistically optimize their representation\nwith knowledge constraints. Extensive experimental results on five datasets\nwith standard and low-resource settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach.",

Among many options of models, we\npropose the generative model and the inference model for variational learning\nof the end-to-end TOD system, both as auto-regressive language models based on\nGPT-2, which can be further trained over a mix of labeled and unlabeled dialog\ndata in a semi-supervised manner. We develop the strategy of\nsampling-then-forward-computation, which successfully overcomes the memory\nexplosion issue of using GPT in variational learning and speeds up training.\nSemi-supervised TOD experiments are conducted on two benchmark multi-domain\ndatasets of different languages - MultiWOZ2.1 and CrossWOZ.

Standard representational similarity measures\nsuch as cosine similarity and Euclidean distance have been successfully used in\nstatic word embedding models to understand how words cluster in semantic space.\nRecently, these measures have been applied to embeddings from contextualized\nmodels such as BERT and GPT-2. In this work, we call into question the\ninformativity of such measures for contextualized language models. We find that\na small number of rogue dimensions, often just 1-3, dominate these measures.\nMoreover, we find a striking mismatch between the dimensions that dominate\nsimilarity measures and those which are important to the behavior of the model.\nWe show that simple postprocessing techniques such as standardization are able\nto correct for rogue dimensions and reveal underlying representational quality.\nWe argue that accounting for rogue dimensions is essential for any\nsimilarity-based analysis of contextual language models.",

MATE uses sparse attention in a way that\nallows heads to efficiently attend to either rows or columns in a table. This\narchitecture scales linearly with respect to speed and memory, and can handle\ndocuments containing more than 8000 tokens with current accelerators. MATE also\nhas a more appropriate inductive bias for tabular data, and sets a new\nstate-of-the-art for three table reasoning datasets.

          "description": "Despite their success in a variety of NLP tasks, pre-trained language models,\ndue to their heavy reliance on compositionality, fail in effectively capturing\nthe meanings of multiword expressions (MWEs), especially idioms. Therefore,\ndatasets and methods to improve the representation of MWEs are urgently needed.\nExisting datasets are limited to providing the degree of idiomaticity of\nexpressions along with the literal and, where applicable, (a single)\nnon-literal interpretation of MWEs. This work presents a novel dataset of\nnaturally occurring sentences containing MWEs manually classified into a\nfine-grained set of meanings, spanning both English and Portuguese. We use this\ndataset in two tasks designed to test i) a language model's ability to detect\nidiom usage, and ii) the effectiveness of a language model in generating\nrepresentations of sentences containing idioms. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat, on the task of detecting idiomatic usage, these models perform reasonably\nwell in the one-shot and few-shot scenarios, but that there is significant\nscope for improvement in the zero-shot scenario. On the task of representing\nidiomaticity, we find that pre-training is not always effective, while\nfine-tuning could provide a sample efficient method of learning representations\nof sentences containing MWEs.",

          "description": "Recent coreference resolution models rely heavily on span representations to\nfind coreference links between word spans. As the number of spans is $O(n^2)$\nin the length of text and the number of potential links is $O(n^4)$, various\npruning techniques are necessary to make this approach computationally\nfeasible. We propose instead to consider coreference links between individual\nwords rather than word spans and then reconstruct the word spans. This reduces\nthe complexity of the coreference model to $O(n^2)$ and allows it to consider\nall potential mentions without pruning any of them out. We also demonstrate\nthat, with these changes, SpanBERT for coreference resolution will be\nsignificantly outperformed by RoBERTa. While being highly efficient, our model\nperforms competitively with recent coreference resolution systems on the\nOntoNotes benchmark.",

          "description": "In cross-lingual text classification, it is required that task-specific\ntraining data in high-resource source languages are available, where the task\nis identical to that of a low-resource target language. However, collecting\nsuch training data can be infeasible because of the labeling cost, task\ncharacteristics, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes an alternative\nsolution that uses only task-independent word embeddings of high-resource\nlanguages and bilingual dictionaries. First, we construct a dictionary-based\nheterogeneous graph (DHG) from bilingual dictionaries. This opens the\npossibility to use graph neural networks for cross-lingual transfer. The\nremaining challenge is the heterogeneity of DHG because multiple languages are\nconsidered. To address this challenge, we propose dictionary-based\nheterogeneous graph neural network (DHGNet) that effectively handles the\nheterogeneity of DHG by two-step aggregations, which are word-level and\nlanguage-level aggregations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\noutperforms pretrained models even though it does not access to large corpora.\nFurthermore, it can perform well even though dictionaries contain many\nincorrect translations. Its robustness allows the usage of a wider range of\ndictionaries such as an automatically constructed dictionary and crowdsourced\ndictionary, which are convenient for real-world applications.",

          "description": "A key challenge in training neural networks for a given medical imaging task\nis often the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of manually labeled\nexamples. In contrast, textual imaging reports, which are often readily\navailable in medical records, contain rich but unstructured interpretations\nwritten by experts as part of standard clinical practice. We propose using\nthese textual reports as a form of weak supervision to improve the image\ninterpretation performance of a neural network without requiring additional\nmanually labeled examples. We use an image-text matching task to train a\nfeature extractor and then fine-tune it in a transfer learning setting for a\nsupervised task using a small labeled dataset. The end result is a neural\nnetwork that automatically interprets imagery without requiring textual reports\nduring inference. This approach can be applied to any task for which text-image\npairs are readily available. We evaluate our method on three classification\ntasks and find consistent performance improvements, reducing the need for\nlabeled data by 67%-98%.",

          "description": "The ability to identify and resolve uncertainty is crucial for the robustness\nof a dialogue system. Indeed, this has been confirmed empirically on systems\nthat utilise Bayesian approaches to dialogue belief tracking. However, such\nsystems consider only confidence estimates and have difficulty scaling to more\ncomplex settings. Neural dialogue systems, on the other hand, rarely take\nuncertainties into account. They are therefore overconfident in their decisions\nand less robust. Moreover, the performance of the tracking task is often\nevaluated in isolation, without consideration of its effect on the downstream\npolicy optimisation. We propose the use of different uncertainty measures in\nneural belief tracking. The effects of these measures on the downstream task of\npolicy optimisation are evaluated by adding selected measures of uncertainty to\nthe feature space of the policy and training policies through interaction with\na user simulator. Both human and simulated user results show that incorporating\nthese measures leads to improvements both of the performance and of the\nrobustness of the downstream dialogue policy. This highlights the importance of\ndeveloping neural dialogue belief trackers that take uncertainty into account.",

          "description": "Pretrained Masked Language Models (MLMs) have revolutionised NLP in recent\nyears. However, previous work has indicated that off-the-shelf MLMs are not\neffective as universal lexical or sentence encoders without further\ntask-specific fine-tuning on NLI, sentence similarity, or paraphrasing tasks\nusing annotated task data. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to\nturn MLMs into effective universal lexical and sentence encoders even without\nany additional data and without any supervision. We propose an extremely\nsimple, fast and effective contrastive learning technique, termed Mirror-BERT,\nwhich converts MLMs (e.g., BERT and RoBERTa) into such encoders in 20-30\nseconds without any additional external knowledge. Mirror-BERT relies on fully\nidentical or slightly modified string pairs as positive (i.e., synonymous)\nfine-tuning examples, and aims to maximise their similarity during identity\nfine-tuning. We report huge gains over off-the-shelf MLMs with Mirror-BERT in\nboth lexical-level and sentence-level tasks, across different domains and\ndifferent languages. Notably, in the standard sentence semantic similarity\n(STS) tasks, our self-supervised Mirror-BERT model even matches the performance\nof the task-tuned Sentence-BERT models from prior work. Finally, we delve\ndeeper into the inner workings of MLMs, and suggest some evidence on why this\nsimple approach can yield effective universal lexical and sentence encoders.",

          "description": "Many implicit inferences exist in text depending on how it is structured that\ncan critically impact the text's interpretation and meaning. One such\nstructural aspect present in text with chronology is the order of its\npresentation. For narratives or stories, this is known as the narrative order.\nReordering a narrative can impact the temporal, causal, event-based, and other\ninferences readers draw from it, which in turn can have strong effects both on\nits interpretation and interestingness. In this paper, we propose and\ninvestigate the task of Narrative Reordering (NAREOR) which involves rewriting\na given story in a different narrative order while preserving its plot. We\npresent a dataset, NAREORC, with human rewritings of stories within ROCStories\nin non-linear orders, and conduct a detailed analysis of it. Further, we\npropose novel task-specific training methods with suitable evaluation metrics.\nWe perform experiments on NAREORC using state-of-the-art models such as BART\nand T5 and conduct extensive automatic and human evaluations. We demonstrate\nthat although our models can perform decently, NAREOR is a challenging task\nwith potential for further exploration. We also investigate two applications of\nNAREOR: generation of more interesting variations of stories and serving as\nadversarial sets for temporal/event-related tasks, besides discussing other\nprospective ones, such as for pedagogical setups related to language skills\nlike essay writing and applications to medicine involving clinical narratives.",

          "description": "Pretrained vision-and-language BERTs aim to learn representations that\ncombine information from both modalities. We propose a diagnostic method based\non cross-modal input ablation to assess the extent to which these models\nactually integrate cross-modal information. This method involves ablating\ninputs from one modality, either entirely or selectively based on cross-modal\ngrounding alignments, and evaluating the model prediction performance on the\nother modality. Model performance is measured by modality-specific tasks that\nmirror the model pretraining objectives (e.g. masked language modelling for\ntext). Models that have learned to construct cross-modal representations using\nboth modalities are expected to perform worse when inputs are missing from a\nmodality. We find that recently proposed models have much greater relative\ndifficulty predicting text when visual information is ablated, compared to\npredicting visual object categories when text is ablated, indicating that these\nmodels are not symmetrically cross-modal.",

          "description": "Prompts for pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown remarkable\nperformance by bridging the gap between pre-training tasks and various\ndownstream tasks. Among these methods, prompt tuning, which freezes PLMs and\nonly tunes soft prompts, provides an efficient and effective solution for\nadapting large-scale PLMs to downstream tasks. However, prompt tuning is yet to\nbe fully explored. In our pilot experiments, we find that prompt tuning\nperforms comparably with conventional full-model fine-tuning when downstream\ndata are sufficient, whereas it performs much worse under few-shot learning\nsettings, which may hinder the application of prompt tuning in practice. We\nattribute this low performance to the manner of initializing soft prompts.\nTherefore, in this work, we propose to pre-train prompts by adding soft prompts\ninto the pre-training stage to obtain a better initialization. We name this\nPre-trained Prompt Tuning framework \"PPT\". To ensure the generalization of PPT,\nwe formulate similar classification tasks into a unified task form and\npre-train soft prompts for this unified task. Extensive experiments show that\ntuning pre-trained prompts for downstream tasks can reach or even outperform\nfull-model fine-tuning under both full-data and few-shot settings.

          "description": "Recently, the textual adversarial attack models become increasingly popular\ndue to their successful in estimating the robustness of NLP models. However,\nexisting works have obvious deficiencies. (1) They usually consider only a\nsingle granularity of modification strategies (e.g. word-level or\nsentence-level), which is insufficient to explore the holistic textual space\nfor generation; (2) They need to query victim models hundreds of times to make\na successful attack, which is highly inefficient in practice. To address such\nproblems, in this paper we propose MAYA, a Multi-grAnularitY Attack model to\neffectively generate high-quality adversarial samples with fewer queries to\nvictim models. Furthermore, we propose a reinforcement-learning based method to\ntrain a multi-granularity attack agent through behavior cloning with the expert\nknowledge from our MAYA algorithm to further reduce the query times.\nAdditionally, we also adapt the agent to attack black-box models that only\noutput labels without confidence scores. We conduct comprehensive experiments\nto evaluate our attack models by attacking BiLSTM, BERT and RoBERTa in two\ndifferent black-box attack settings and three benchmark datasets. Experimental\nresults show that our models achieve overall better attacking performance and\nproduce more fluent and grammatical adversarial samples compared to baseline\nmodels. Besides, our adversarial attack agent significantly reduces the query\ntimes in both attack settings. Our codes are released at\nhttps://github.com/Yangyi-Chen/MAYA.",

To address the above issue in a more principled\nmanner, we propose a new computational framework for robust and efficient\nfine-tuning for pre-trained language models. Specifically, our proposed\nframework contains two important ingredients: 1. Smoothness-inducing\nregularization, which effectively manages the capacity of the model; 2.

Besides being computationally efficient, KnowledgeEditordoes not\nrequire any modifications in LM pre-training (e.g., the use of meta-learning).\nIn our approach, we train a hyper-network with constrained optimization to\nmodify a fact without affecting the rest of the knowledge; the trained\nhyper-network is then used to predict the weight update at test time.

          "description": "Contrastive learning has been attracting much attention for learning\nunsupervised sentence embeddings. The current state-of-the-art unsupervised\nmethod is the unsupervised SimCSE (unsup-SimCSE). Unsup-SimCSE takes dropout as\na minimal data augmentation method, and passes the same input sentence to a\npre-trained Transformer encoder (with dropout turned on) twice to obtain the\ntwo corresponding embeddings to build a positive pair. As the length\ninformation of a sentence will generally be encoded into the sentence\nembeddings due to the usage of position embedding in Transformer, each positive\npair in unsup-SimCSE actually contains the same length information. And thus\nunsup-SimCSE trained with these positive pairs is probably biased, which would\ntend to consider that sentences of the same or similar length are more similar\nin semantics. Through statistical observations, we find that unsup-SimCSE does\nhave such a problem. To alleviate it, we apply a simple repetition operation to\nmodify the input sentence, and then pass the input sentence and its modified\ncounterpart to the pre-trained Transformer encoder, respectively, to get the\npositive pair. Additionally, we draw inspiration from the community of computer\nvision and introduce a momentum contrast, enlarging the number of negative\npairs without additional calculations. The proposed two modifications are\napplied on positive and negative pairs separately, and build a new sentence\nembedding method, termed Enhanced Unsup-SimCSE (ESimCSE). We evaluate the\nproposed ESimCSE on several benchmark datasets w.r.t the semantic text\nsimilarity (STS) task. Experimental results show that ESimCSE outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art unsup-SimCSE by an average Spearman correlation of 2.02% on\nBERT-base.",

          "description": "This article describes an efficient end-to-end speech translation (E2E-ST)\nframework based on non-autoregressive (NAR) models. End-to-end speech\ntranslation models have several advantages over traditional cascade systems\nsuch as inference latency reduction. However, conventional AR decoding methods\nare not fast enough because each token is generated incrementally. NAR models,\nhowever, can accelerate the decoding speed by generating multiple tokens in\nparallel on the basis of the token-wise conditional independence assumption. We\npropose a unified NAR E2E-ST framework called Orthros, which has an NAR decoder\nand an auxiliary shallow AR decoder on top of the shared encoder. The auxiliary\nshallow AR decoder selects the best hypothesis by rescoring multiple candidates\ngenerated from the NAR decoder in parallel (parallel AR rescoring). We adopt\nconditional masked language model (CMLM) and a connectionist temporal\nclassification (CTC)-based model as NAR decoders for Orthros, referred to as\nOrthros-CMLM and Orthros-CTC, respectively. We also propose two training\nmethods to enhance the CMLM decoder. Experimental evaluations on three\nbenchmark datasets with six language directions demonstrated that Orthros\nachieved large improvements in translation quality with a very small overhead\ncompared with the baseline NAR model. Moreover, the Conformer encoder\narchitecture enabled large quality improvements, especially for CTC-based\nmodels. Orthros-CTC with the Conformer encoder increased decoding speed by\n3.63x on CPU with translation quality comparable to that of an AR model.",

          "description": "Opinion summarization has been traditionally approached with unsupervised,\nweakly-supervised and few-shot learning techniques. In this work, we collect a\nlarge dataset of summaries paired with user reviews for over 31,000 products,\nenabling supervised training. However, the number of reviews per product is\nlarge (320 on average), making summarization - and especially training a\nsummarizer - impractical. Moreover, the content of many reviews is not\nreflected in the human-written summaries, and, thus, the summarizer trained on\nrandom review subsets hallucinates. In order to deal with both of these\nchallenges, we formulate the task as jointly learning to select informative\nsubsets of reviews and summarizing the opinions expressed in these subsets. The\nchoice of the review subset is treated as a latent variable, predicted by a\nsmall and simple selector. The subset is then fed into a more powerful\nsummarizer. For joint training, we use amortized variational inference and\npolicy gradient methods. Our experiments demonstrate the importance of\nselecting informative reviews resulting in improved quality of summaries and\nreduced hallucinations.",

Enforcing\nconstraints to uphold such criteria may render attacks unsuccessful, raising\nthe question of whether valid attacks are actually feasible. In this work, we\ninvestigate this through the lens of human language ability. We report on\ncrowdsourcing studies in which we task humans with iteratively modifying words\nin an input text, while receiving immediate model feedback, with the aim of\ncausing a sentiment classification model to misclassify the example. Our\nfindings suggest that humans are capable of generating a substantial amount of\nadversarial examples using semantics-preserving word substitutions. We analyze\nhow human-generated adversarial examples compare to the recently proposed\nTextFooler, Genetic, BAE and SememePSO attack algorithms on the dimensions\nnaturalness, preservation of sentiment, grammaticality and substitution rate.\nOur findings suggest that human-generated adversarial examples are not more\nable than the best algorithms to generate natural-reading, sentiment-preserving\nexamples, though they do so by being much more computationally efficient.",

          "description": "Currently, multilingual machine translation is receiving more and more\nattention since it brings better performance for low resource languages (LRLs)\nand saves more space. However, existing multilingual machine translation models\nface a severe challenge: imbalance. As a result, the translation performance of\ndifferent languages in multilingual translation models are quite different. We\nargue that this imbalance problem stems from the different learning\ncompetencies of different languages. Therefore, we focus on balancing the\nlearning competencies of different languages and propose Competence-based\nCurriculum Learning for Multilingual Machine Translation, named CCL-M.\nSpecifically, we firstly define two competencies to help schedule the high\nresource languages (HRLs) and the low resource languages: 1) Self-evaluated\nCompetence, evaluating how well the language itself has been learned; and 2)\nHRLs-evaluated Competence, evaluating whether an LRL is ready to be learned\naccording to HRLs' Self-evaluated Competence. Based on the above competencies,\nwe utilize the proposed CCL-M algorithm to gradually add new languages into the\ntraining set in a curriculum learning manner. Furthermore, we propose a novel\ncompetenceaware dynamic balancing sampling strategy for better selecting\ntraining samples in multilingual training. Experimental results show that our\napproach has achieved a steady and significant performance gain compared to the\nprevious state-of-the-art approach on the TED talks dataset.",

We design a hierarchical relational-graph-based message passing mechanism,\nwhich can allow the representations of injected KG and text to mutually update\neach other and can dynamically select ambiguous mentioned entities that share\nthe same text. Our empirical results show that our model can efficiently\nincorporate world knowledge from KGs into existing language models such as\nBERT, and achieve significant improvement on the machine reading comprehension\n(MRC) task compared with other knowledge-enhanced models.",

          "description": "When trained on large, unfiltered crawls from the internet, language models\npick up and reproduce all kinds of undesirable biases that can be found in the\ndata: they often generate racist, sexist, violent or otherwise toxic language.\nAs large models require millions of training examples to achieve good\nperformance, it is difficult to completely prevent them from being exposed to\nsuch content. In this paper, we first demonstrate a surprising finding:\npretrained language models recognize, to a considerable degree, their\nundesirable biases and the toxicity of the content they produce. We refer to\nthis capability as self-diagnosis. Based on this finding, we then propose a\ndecoding algorithm that, given only a textual description of the undesired\nbehavior, reduces the probability of a language model producing problematic\ntext. We refer to this approach as self-debiasing. Self-debiasing does not rely\non manually curated word lists, nor does it require any training data or\nchanges to the model's parameters. While we by no means eliminate the issue of\nlanguage models generating biased text, we believe our approach to be an\nimportant step in this direction.",

Next, we show that counter machines cannot\nevaluate boolean expressions, even though they can weakly validate their\nsyntax. This has implications for the interpretability and evaluation of neural\nnetwork systems: successfully matching syntactic patterns does not guarantee\nthat counter memory accurately encodes compositional semantics.

          "description": "Code representation learning, which aims to encode the semantics of source\ncode into distributed vectors, plays an important role in recent\ndeep-learning-based models for code intelligence. Recently, many pre-trained\nlanguage models for source code (e.g., CuBERT and CodeBERT) have been proposed\nto model the context of code and serve as a basis for downstream code\nintelligence tasks such as code search, code clone detection, and program\ntranslation. Current approaches typically consider the source code as a plain\nsequence of tokens, or inject the structure information (e.g., AST and\ndata-flow) into the sequential model pre-training. To further explore the\nproperties of programming languages, this paper proposes SynCoBERT, a\nsyntax-guided multi-modal contrastive pre-training approach for better code\nrepresentations. Specially, we design two novel pre-training objectives\noriginating from the symbolic and syntactic properties of source code, i.e.,\nIdentifier Prediction (IP) and AST Edge Prediction (TEP), which are designed to\npredict identifiers, and edges between two nodes of AST, respectively.\nMeanwhile, to exploit the complementary information in semantically equivalent\nmodalities (i.e., code, comment, AST) of the code, we propose a multi-modal\ncontrastive learning strategy to maximize the mutual information among\ndifferent modalities. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks related to\ncode intelligence show that SynCoBERT advances the state-of-the-art with the\nsame pre-training corpus and model size.",

Introducing such multi label examples\nat the cost of annotating fewer examples brings clear gains on natural language\ninference task and entity typing task, even when we simply first train with a\nsingle label data and then fine tune with multi label examples.

          "description": "Existing conversational systems are mostly agent-centric, which assumes the\nuser utterances would closely follow the system ontology (for NLU or dialogue\nstate tracking). However, in real-world scenarios, it is highly desirable that\nthe users can speak freely in their own way. It is extremely hard, if not\nimpossible, for the users to adapt to the unknown system ontology. In this\nwork, we attempt to build a user-centric dialogue system. As there is no clean\nmapping for a user's free form utterance to an ontology, we first model the\nuser preferences as estimated distributions over the system ontology and map\nthe users' utterances to such distributions. Learning such a mapping poses new\nchallenges on reasoning over existing knowledge, ranging from factoid\nknowledge, commonsense knowledge to the users' own situations. To this end, we\nbuild a new dataset named NUANCED that focuses on such realistic settings for\nconversational recommendation. Collected via dialogue simulation and\nparaphrasing, NUANCED contains 5.1k dialogues, 26k turns of high-quality user\nresponses. We conduct experiments, showing both the usefulness and challenges\nof our problem setting.

          "description": "The goal of building intelligent dialogue systems has largely been\n\\textit{separately} pursued under two paradigms: task-oriented dialogue (TOD)\nsystems, which perform goal-oriented functions, and open-domain dialogue (ODD)\nsystems, which focus on non-goal-oriented chitchat. The two dialogue modes can\npotentially be intertwined together seamlessly in the same conversation, as\neasily done by a friendly human assistant. Such ability is desirable in\nconversational agents, as the integration makes them more accessible and\nuseful. Our paper addresses this problem of fusing TODs and ODDs in multi-turn\ndialogues. Based on the popular TOD dataset MultiWOZ, we build a new dataset\nFusedChat, by rewriting the existing TOD turns and adding new ODD turns. This\nprocedure constructs conversation sessions containing exchanges from both\ndialogue modes. It features inter-mode contextual dependency, i.e., the\ndialogue turns from the two modes depend on each other. Rich dependency\npatterns including co-reference and ellipsis are features. The new dataset,\nwith 60k new human-written ODD turns and 5k re-written TOD turns, offers a\nbenchmark to test a dialogue model's ability to perform inter-mode\nconversations. This is a more challenging task since the model has to determine\nthe appropriate dialogue mode and generate the response based on the inter-mode\ncontext. But such models would better mimic human-level conversation\ncapabilities. We evaluate baseline models on this task, including\n\\textit{classification-based} two-stage models and \\textit{two-in-one} fused\nmodels.

          "description": "Transformers have recently become very popular for sequence-to-sequence\napplications such as machine translation and speech recognition. In this work,\nwe propose a multi-task learning-based transformer model for low-resource\nmultilingual speech recognition for Indian languages. Our proposed model\nconsists of a conformer [1] encoder and two parallel transformer decoders. We\nuse a phoneme decoder (PHN-DEC) for the phoneme recognition task and a grapheme\ndecoder (GRP-DEC) to predict grapheme sequence. We consider the phoneme\nrecognition task as an auxiliary task for our multi-task learning framework. We\njointly optimize the network for both phoneme and grapheme recognition tasks\nusing Joint CTC-Attention [2] training. We use a conditional decoding scheme to\ninject the language information into the model before predicting the grapheme\nsequence. Our experiments show that our proposed approach can obtain\nsignificant improvement over previous approaches [4]. We also show that our\nconformer-based dual-decoder approach outperforms both the transformer-based\ndual-decoder approach and single decoder approach. Finally, We compare\nmonolingual ASR models with our proposed multilingual ASR approach.",

          "description": "Recent works have found evidence of gender bias in models of machine\ntranslation and coreference resolution using mostly synthetic diagnostic\ndatasets. While these quantify bias in a controlled experiment, they often do\nso on a small scale and consist mostly of artificial, out-of-distribution\nsentences. In this work, we find grammatical patterns indicating stereotypical\nand non-stereotypical gender-role assignments (e.g., female nurses versus male\ndancers) in corpora from three domains, resulting in a first large-scale gender\nbias dataset of 108K diverse real-world English sentences. We manually verify\nthe quality of our corpus and use it to evaluate gender bias in various\ncoreference resolution and machine translation models. We find that all tested\nmodels tend to over-rely on gender stereotypes when presented with natural\ninputs, which may be especially harmful when deployed in commercial systems.\nFinally, we show that our dataset lends itself to finetuning a coreference\nresolution model, finding it mitigates bias on a held out set. Our dataset and\nmodels are publicly available at www.github.com/SLAB-NLP/BUG. We hope they will\nspur future research into gender bias evaluation mitigation techniques in\nrealistic settings.",

          "description": "Knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA) requires answering questions\nwith external knowledge in addition to the content of images. One dataset that\nis mostly used in evaluating knowledge-based VQA is OK-VQA, but it lacks a gold\nstandard knowledge corpus for retrieval. Existing work leverage different\nknowledge bases (e.g., ConceptNet and Wikipedia) to obtain external knowledge.\nBecause of varying knowledge bases, it is hard to fairly compare models'\nperformance. To address this issue, we collect a natural language knowledge\nbase that can be used for any VQA system. Moreover, we propose a Visual\nRetriever-Reader pipeline to approach knowledge-based VQA. The visual retriever\naims to retrieve relevant knowledge, and the visual reader seeks to predict\nanswers based on given knowledge. We introduce various ways to retrieve\nknowledge using text and images and two reader styles: classification and\nextraction. Both the retriever and reader are trained with weak supervision.\nOur experimental results show that a good retriever can significantly improve\nthe reader's performance on the OK-VQA challenge.

While a number of works have considered table-based fact\nverification, direct alignments of tabular data with tokens in textual\nstatements are rarely available.

From the other perspective, our\nsystem applies salience-aware data augmentation to generate a more diverse set\nof training instances by replacing non-salient terms.

The mutual information, however, assumes\nthe true probability distribution of a pair of random variables is known,\nleading to unintuitive results in settings where it is not. This paper proposes\na new framework to measure what we term Bayesian mutual information, which\nanalyses information from the perspective of Bayesian agents -- allowing for\nmore intuitive findings in scenarios with finite data. For instance, under\nBayesian MI we have that data can add information, processing can help, and\ninformation can hurt, which makes it more intuitive for machine learning\napplications.

          "description": "Transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range of\nNLP tasks including summarization. Training and inference using large\ntransformer models can be computationally expensive. Previous work has focused\non one important bottleneck, the quadratic self-attention mechanism in the\nencoder. Modified encoder architectures such as LED or LoBART use local\nattention patterns to address this problem for summarization. In contrast, this\nwork focuses on the transformer's encoder-decoder attention mechanism. The cost\nof this attention becomes more significant in inference or training approaches\nthat require model-generated histories. First, we examine the complexity of the\nencoder-decoder attention. We demonstrate empirically that there is a sparse\nsentence structure in document summarization that can be exploited by\nconstraining the attention mechanism to a subset of input sentences, whilst\nmaintaining system performance. Second, we propose a modified architecture that\nselects the subset of sentences to constrain the encoder-decoder attention.\nExperiments are carried out on abstractive summarization tasks, including\nCNN/DailyMail, XSum, Spotify Podcast, and arXiv.",

In this\narticle, we probe BERT specifically to understand and measure the relational\nknowledge it captures in its parametric memory. While probing for linguistic\nunderstanding is commonly applied to all layers of BERT as well as fine-tuned\nmodels, this has not been done for factual knowledge. We utilize existing\nknowledge base completion tasks (LAMA) to probe every layer of pre-trained as\nwell as fine-tuned BERT models(ranking, question answering, NER). Our findings\nshow that knowledge is not just contained in BERT's final layers. Intermediate\nlayers contribute a significant amount (17-60%) to the total knowledge found.\nProbing intermediate layers also reveals how different types of knowledge\nemerge at varying rates. When BERT is fine-tuned, relational knowledge is\nforgotten. The extent of forgetting is impacted by the fine-tuning objective\nand the training data. We found that ranking models forget the least and retain\nmore knowledge in their final layer compared to masked language modeling and\nquestion-answering.

In this work, we study\nwhat specific traits in the pre-training data, other than the semantics, make a\npre-trained LM superior to their counterparts trained from scratch on\ndownstream tasks. We propose to use artificially constructed datasets as the\npre-training data to exclude the effect of semantics, and further control what\ncharacteristics the pre-training corpora have. By fine-tuning the pre-trained\nmodels on GLUE benchmark, we can learn how beneficial it is to transfer the\nknowledge from the model trained on the dataset possessing that specific trait.\nWe define and discuss three different characteristics in the artificial\ndataset: 1) matching the token's uni-gram or bi-gram distribution between\npre-training and downstream fine-tuning, 2) the presence of the explicit\ndependencies among the tokens in a sequence, 3) the length of the implicit\ndependencies among the tokens in a sequence. Our experiments show that the\nexplicit dependencies in the sequences of the pre-training data are critical to\nthe downstream performance. Our results also reveal that models achieve better\ndownstream performance when pre-trained on a dataset with a longer range of\nimplicit dependencies. Based on our analysis, we find that models pre-trained\nwith artificial datasets are prone to learn spurious correlation in downstream\ntasks. Our work reveals that even if the LMs are not pre-trained on natural\nlanguage, they still gain transferability on certain human language downstream\ntasks once the LMs learn to model the token dependencies in the sequences. This\nresult helps us understand the exceptional transferability of pre-trained LMs.",

In our\nexperiments on TACRED we attain 63% F1 zero-shot, 69% with 16 examples per\nrelation (17% points better than the best supervised system on the same\nconditions), and only 4 points short to the state-of-the-art (which uses 20\ntimes more training data).

For generative dialogue models, being trained on real human\nconversations containing unbalanced gender and race/ethnicity references can\nlead to models that display learned biases, which we define here broadly as any\nmeasurable differences in the distributions of words or semantic content of\nconversations based on demographic groups. We measure the strength of such\nbiases by producing artificial conversations between two copies of a dialogue\nmodel, conditioning one conversational partner to state a name commonly\nassociated with a certain gender and/or race/ethnicity. We find that larger\ncapacity models tend to exhibit more gender bias and greater stereotyping of\noccupations by gender. We show that several methods of tuning these dialogue\nmodels, specifically name scrambling, controlled generation, and unlikelihood\ntraining, are effective in reducing bias in conversation, including on a\ndownstream conversational task. Name scrambling is also effective in lowering\ndifferences in token usage across conversations where partners have names\nassociated with different genders or races/ethnicities.",

For zero-shot performance,\nit makes sense to design patterns that closely resemble the text seen during\nself-supervised pretraining because the model has never seen anything else.\nSupervised training allows for more flexibility. If we allow for tokens outside\nthe PLM's vocabulary, patterns can be adapted more flexibly to a PLM's\nidiosyncrasies. Contrasting patterns where a \"token\" can be any continuous\nvector vs. those where a discrete choice between vocabulary elements has to be\nmade, we call our method CONtinuous pAtterNs (CONAN). We evaluate CONAN on two\nestablished benchmarks for lexical inference in context (LIiC) a.k.a. predicate\nentailment, a challenging natural language understanding task with relatively\nsmall training sets. In a direct comparison with discrete patterns, CONAN\nconsistently leads to improved performance, setting a new state of the art.

When BERT is\nfine-tuned, relational knowledge is forgotten but the extent of forgetting is\nimpacted by the fine-tuning objective but not the size of the dataset.

We improve upon this\nparadigm by proposing a novel chart-based method and an effective top-K\nensemble technique. Moreover, we demonstrate that we can broaden the scope of\napplication of the approach into multilingual settings. Specifically, we show\nthat by applying our method on multilingual PLMs, it becomes possible to induce\nnon-trivial parses for sentences from nine languages in an integrated and\nlanguage-agnostic manner, attaining performance superior or comparable to that\nof unsupervised PCFGs. We also verify that our approach is robust to\ncross-lingual transfer. Finally, we provide analyses on the inner workings of\nour method.

In this\npaper, we develop an unsupervised OOD detection method, in which only the\nin-distribution (ID) data are used in training. We propose to fine-tune the\nTransformers with a contrastive loss, which improves the compactness of\nrepresentations, such that OOD instances can be better differentiated from ID\nones.

          "description": "Unfair stereotypical biases (e.g., gender, racial, or religious biases)\nencoded in modern pretrained language models (PLMs) have negative ethical\nimplications for widespread adoption of state-of-the-art language technology.\nTo remedy for this, a wide range of debiasing techniques have recently been\nintroduced to remove such stereotypical biases from PLMs. Existing debiasing\nmethods, however, directly modify all of the PLMs parameters, which -- besides\nbeing computationally expensive -- comes with the inherent risk of\n(catastrophic) forgetting of useful language knowledge acquired in pretraining.\nIn this work, we propose a more sustainable modular debiasing approach based on\ndedicated debiasing adapters, dubbed ADELE. Concretely, we (1) inject adapter\nmodules into the original PLM layers and (2) update only the adapters (i.e., we\nkeep the original PLM parameters frozen) via language modeling training on a\ncounterfactually augmented corpus. We showcase ADELE, in gender debiasing of\nBERT: our extensive evaluation, encompassing three intrinsic and two extrinsic\nbias measures, renders ADELE, very effective in bias mitigation. We further\nshow that -- due to its modular nature -- ADELE, coupled with task adapters,\nretains fairness even after large-scale downstream training. Finally, by means\nof multilingual BERT, we successfully transfer ADELE, to six target languages.",

          "description": "Pretrained language models (PLM) have recently advanced graph-to-text\ngeneration, where the input graph is linearized into a sequence and fed into\nthe PLM to obtain its representation. However, efficiently encoding the graph\nstructure in PLMs is challenging because such models were pretrained on natural\nlanguage, and modeling structured data may lead to catastrophic forgetting of\ndistributional knowledge. In this paper, we propose StructAdapt, an adapter\nmethod to encode graph structure into PLMs. Contrary to prior work, StructAdapt\neffectively models interactions among the nodes based on the graph\nconnectivity, only training graph structure-aware adapter parameters. In this\nway, we incorporate task-specific knowledge while maintaining the topological\nstructure of the graph. We empirically show the benefits of explicitly encoding\ngraph structure into PLMs using StructAdapt, outperforming the state of the art\non two AMR-to-text datasets, training only 5.1% of the PLM parameters.",

          "description": "Large pre-trained language models (LMs) such as GPT-3 have acquired a\nsurprising ability to perform zero-shot learning.

However, the next word prediction training\nobjective is still misaligned with the target zero-shot learning objective. To\naddress this weakness, we propose meta-tuning, which directly optimizes the\nzero-shot learning objective by fine-tuning pre-trained language models on a\ncollection of datasets. We focus on classification tasks, and construct the\nmeta-dataset by aggregating 43 existing datasets and annotating 441 label\ndescriptions in a question-answering (QA) format. When evaluated on unseen\ntasks, meta-tuned models outperform a same-sized QA model and the previous SOTA\nzero-shot learning system based on natural language inference. Additionally,\nincreasing parameter count from 220M to 770M improves AUC-ROC scores by 6.3%,\nand we forecast that even larger models would perform better. Therefore,\nmeasuring zero-shot learning performance on language models out-of-the-box\nmight underestimate their true potential, and community-wide efforts on\naggregating datasets and unifying their formats can help build models that\nanswer prompts better.",

This work presents Referee, a robust\nreference-free CSST approach for expressive TTS, which fully leverages\nlow-quality data to learn speaking styles from text.

A novel pretrain-refinement method is adopted to\nlearn a robust T2S model by only using readily accessible low-quality data. The\nS2W model is trained with high-quality target data, which is adopted to\neffectively aggregate style descriptors and generate high-fidelity speech in\nthe target speaker's voice.

The recent advance\nin OCR enables the accurate recognition of text blocks, yet it is still\nchallenging to extract key information from documents due to the diversity of\ntheir layouts. Although recent studies on pre-trained language models show the\nimportance of incorporating layout information on this task, the conjugation of\ntexts and their layouts still follows the style of BERT optimized for\nunderstanding the 1D text. This implies there is room for further improvement\nconsidering the 2D nature of text layouts. This paper introduces a pre-trained\nlanguage model, BERT Relying On Spatiality (BROS), which effectively utilizes\nthe information included in individual text blocks and their layouts.\nSpecifically, BROS encodes spatial information by utilizing relative positions\nand learns spatial dependencies between OCR blocks with a novel area-masking\nstrategy. These two novel approaches lead to an efficient encoding of spatial\nlayout information highlighted by the robust performance of BROS under\nlow-resource environments. We also introduce a general-purpose parser that can\nbe combined with BROS to extract key information even when there is no order\ninformation between text blocks. BROS shows its superiority on four public\nbenchmarks -- FUNSD, SROIE*, CORD, and SciTSR -- and its robustness in\npractical cases where order information of text blocks is not available.\nFurther experiments with a varying number of training examples demonstrate the\nhigh training efficiency of our approach.

Many DA approaches aim at expanding the\nsupport of the empirical data distribution by generating new sentence pairs\nthat contain infrequent words, thus making it closer to the true data\ndistribution of parallel sentences. In this paper, we propose to follow a\ncompletely different approach and present a multi-task DA approach in which we\ngenerate new sentence pairs with transformations, such as reversing the order\nof the target sentence, which produce unfluent target sentences. During\ntraining, these augmented sentences are used as auxiliary tasks in a multi-task\nframework with the aim of providing new contexts where the target prefix is not\ninformative enough to predict the next word. This strengthens the encoder and\nforces the decoder to pay more attention to the source representations of the\nencoder. Experiments carried out on six low-resource translation tasks show\nconsistent improvements over the baseline and over DA methods aiming at\nextending the support of the empirical data distribution.

          "description": "Despite significant progress has been achieved in text summarization, factual\ninconsistency in generated summaries still severely limits its practical\napplications. Among the key factors to ensure factual consistency, a reliable\nautomatic evaluation metric is the first and the most crucial one. However,\nexisting metrics either neglect the intrinsic cause of the factual\ninconsistency or rely on auxiliary tasks, leading to an unsatisfied correlation\nwith human judgments or increasing the inconvenience of usage in practice. In\nlight of these challenges, we propose a novel metric to evaluate the factual\nconsistency in text summarization via counterfactual estimation, which\nformulates the causal relationship among the source document, the generated\nsummary, and the language prior. We remove the effect of language prior, which\ncan cause factual inconsistency, from the total causal effect on the generated\nsummary, and provides a simple yet effective way to evaluate consistency\nwithout relying on other auxiliary tasks. We conduct a series of experiments on\nthree public abstractive text summarization datasets, and demonstrate the\nadvantages of the proposed metric in both improving the correlation with human\njudgments and the convenience of usage.

          "description": "Language use differs between domains and even within a domain, language use\nchanges over time. For pre-trained language models like BERT, domain adaptation\nthrough continued pre-training has been shown to improve performance on\nin-domain downstream tasks. In this article, we investigate whether temporal\nadaptation can bring additional benefits. For this purpose, we introduce a\ncorpus of social media comments sampled over three years. It contains\nunlabelled data for adaptation and evaluation on an upstream masked language\nmodelling task as well as labelled data for fine-tuning and evaluation on a\ndownstream document classification task. We find that temporality matters for\nboth tasks: temporal adaptation improves upstream and temporal fine-tuning\ndownstream task performance. Time-specific models generally perform better on\npast than on future test sets, which matches evidence on the bursty usage of\ntopical words. However, adapting BERT to time and domain does not improve\nperformance on the downstream task over only adapting to domain. Token-level\nanalysis shows that temporal adaptation captures event-driven changes in\nlanguage use in the downstream task, but not those changes that are actually\nrelevant to task performance. Based on our findings, we discuss when temporal\nadaptation may be more effective.",

While it is very costly to filter noisy labels in\nlarge learning resources, recent studies show that such labels take more\ntraining steps to be memorized and are more frequently forgotten than clean\nlabels, therefore are identifiable in training. Motivated by such properties,\nwe propose a simple co-regularization framework for entity-centric information\nextraction, which consists of several neural models with identical structures\nbut different parameter initialization. These models are jointly optimized with\nthe task-specific losses and are regularized to generate similar predictions\nbased on an agreement loss, which prevents overfitting on noisy labels.\nExtensive experiments on two widely used but noisy benchmarks for information\nextraction, TACRED and CoNLL03, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.\nWe release our code to the community for future research.",

          "description": "Speech pre-training has primarily demonstrated efficacy on classification\ntasks, while its capability of generating novel speech, similar to how GPT-2\ncan generate coherent paragraphs, has barely been explored. Generative Spoken\nLanguage Modeling (GSLM) (Lakhotia et al., 2021) is the only prior work\naddressing the generative aspects of speech pre-training, which replaces text\nwith discovered phone-like units for language modeling and shows the ability to\ngenerate meaningful novel sentences. Unfortunately, despite eliminating the\nneed of text, the units used in GSLM discard most of the prosodic information.\nHence, GSLM fails to leverage prosody for better comprehension, and does not\ngenerate expressive speech. In this work, we present a prosody-aware generative\nspoken language model (pGSLM). It is composed of a multi-stream transformer\nlanguage model (MS-TLM) of speech, represented as discovered unit and prosodic\nfeature streams, and an adapted HiFi-GAN model converting MS-TLM outputs to\nwaveforms. We devise a series of metrics for prosody modeling and generation,\nand re-use metrics from GSLM for content modeling. Experimental results show\nthat the pGSLM can utilize prosody to improve both prosody and content\nmodeling, and also generate natural, meaningful, and coherent speech given a\nspoken prompt.

In this\npaper, we propose novel training schemes for spoken question answering with a\nself-supervised training stage and a contrastive representation learning stage.\nIn the self-supervised stage, we propose three auxiliary self-supervised tasks,\nincluding utterance restoration, utterance insertion, and question\ndiscrimination, and jointly train the model to capture consistency and\ncoherence among speech documents without any additional data or annotations. We\nthen propose to learn noise-invariant utterance representations in a\ncontrastive objective by adopting multiple augmentation strategies, including\nspan deletion and span substitution. Besides, we design a Temporal-Alignment\nattention to semantically align the speech-text clues in the learned common\nspace and benefit the SQA tasks. By this means, the training schemes can more\neffectively guide the generation model to predict more proper answers.\nExperimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on\nthree SQA benchmarks.",

Higher usage of these low-touch systems\nis a win-win for both customers and the organization since it enables\norganizations to attain a low cost of service while customers get served\nwithout delay. In this paper, we propose a two-part framework where the first\npart describes methods to combine the information from different interaction\nchannels like call, search, and chat. We do this by summarizing (using a\nstacked Bi-LSTM network) the high-touch interaction channel data such as call\nand chat into short searchquery like customer intents and then creating an\norganically grown intent taxonomy from interaction data (using Hierarchical\nAgglomerative Clustering). The second part of the framework focuses on\nextracting customer questions by analyzing interaction data sources. It\ncalculates similarity scores using TF-IDF and BERT(Devlin et al., 2019).

          "description": "We introduce MULTI-EURLEX, a new multilingual dataset for topic\nclassification of legal documents. The dataset comprises 65k European Union\n(EU) laws, officially translated in 23 languages, annotated with multiple\nlabels from the EUROVOC taxonomy. We highlight the effect of temporal concept\ndrift and the importance of chronological, instead of random splits. We use the\ndataset as a testbed for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, where we exploit\nannotated training documents in one language (source) to classify documents in\nanother language (target). We find that fine-tuning a multilingually pretrained\nmodel (XLM-ROBERTA, MT5) in a single source language leads to catastrophic\nforgetting of multilingual knowledge and, consequently, poor zero-shot transfer\nto other languages. Adaptation strategies, namely partial fine-tuning,\nadapters, BITFIT, LNFIT, originally proposed to accelerate fine-tuning for new\nend-tasks, help retain multilingual knowledge from pretraining, substantially\nimproving zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, but their impact also depends on\nthe pretrained model used and the size of the label set.",

In this paper, we propose NumGPT, a generative pre-trained model\nthat explicitly models the numerical properties of numbers in texts.\nSpecifically, it leverages a prototype-based numeral embedding to encode the\nmantissa of the number and an individual embedding to encode the exponent of\nthe number. A numeral-aware loss function is designed to integrate numerals\ninto the pre-training objective of NumGPT. We conduct extensive experiments on\nfour different datasets to evaluate the numeracy ability of NumGPT. The\nexperiment results show that NumGPT outperforms baseline models (e.g., GPT and\nGPT with DICE) on a range of numerical reasoning tasks such as measurement\nestimation, number comparison, math word problems, and magnitude\nclassification.

The lack of\nsufficient information might cause the monotonic attention to take poor\nread/write decisions, which in turn negatively affects the performance of the\nSNMT model. On the other hand, human translators make better read/write\ndecisions since they can anticipate the immediate future words using linguistic\ninformation and domain knowledge.Motivated by human translators, in this work,\nwe propose a framework to aid monotonic attention with an external language\nmodel to improve its decisions.We conduct experiments on the MuST-C\nEnglish-German and English-French speech-to-text translation tasks to show the\neffectiveness of the proposed framework.The proposed SNMT method improves the\nquality-latency trade-off over the state-of-the-art monotonic multihead\nattention.",

          "description": "Aspect-level sentiment classification (ALSC) aims at identifying the\nsentiment polarity of a specified aspect in a sentence. ALSC is a practical\nsetting in aspect-based sentiment analysis due to no opinion term labeling\nneeded, but it fails to interpret why a sentiment polarity is derived for the\naspect. To address this problem, recent works fine-tune pre-trained Transformer\nencoders for ALSC to extract an aspect-centric dependency tree that can locate\nthe opinion words. However, the induced opinion words only provide an intuitive\ncue far below human-level interpretability. Besides, the pre-trained encoder\ntends to internalize an aspect's intrinsic sentiment, causing sentiment bias\nand thus affecting model performance. In this paper, we propose a span-based\nanti-bias aspect representation learning framework. It first eliminates the\nsentiment bias in the aspect embedding by adversarial learning against aspects'\nprior sentiment. Then, it aligns the distilled opinion candidates with the\naspect by span-based dependency modeling to highlight the interpretable opinion\nterms. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks,\nwith the capability of unsupervised opinion extraction.",

          "description": "Conversation disentanglement aims to separate intermingled messages into\ndetached sessions, which is a fundamental task in understanding multi-party\nconversations. Existing work on conversation disentanglement relies heavily\nupon human-annotated datasets, which are expensive to obtain in practice. In\nthis work, we explore to train a conversation disentanglement model without\nreferencing any human annotations. Our method is built upon a deep co-training\nalgorithm, which consists of two neural networks: a message-pair classifier and\na session classifier. The former is responsible for retrieving local relations\nbetween two messages while the latter categorizes a message to a session by\ncapturing context-aware information. Both networks are initialized respectively\nwith pseudo data built from an unannotated corpus. During the deep co-training\nprocess, we use the session classifier as a reinforcement learning component to\nlearn a session assigning policy by maximizing the local rewards given by the\nmessage-pair classifier. For the message-pair classifier, we enrich its\ntraining data by retrieving message pairs with high confidence from the\ndisentangled sessions predicted by the session classifier. Experimental results\non the large Movie Dialogue Dataset demonstrate that our proposed approach\nachieves competitive performance compared to the previous supervised methods.\nFurther experiments show that the predicted disentangled conversations can\npromote the performance on the downstream task of multi-party response\nselection.",

In this paper, we target at how to further improve the token\nrepresentations on the language models. We, therefore, propose a simple yet\neffective plug-and-play module, Sequential Attention Module (SAM), on the token\nembeddings learned from a pre-trained language model. Our proposed SAM consists\nof two main attention modules deployed sequentially: Feature-wise Attention\nModule (FAM) and Token-wise Attention Module (TAM). More specifically, FAM can\neffectively identify the importance of features at each dimension and promote\nthe effect via dot-product on the original token embeddings for downstream NLP\napplications. Meanwhile, TAM can further re-weight the features at the\ntoken-wise level. Moreover, we propose an adaptive filter on FAM to prevent\nnoise impact and increase information absorption. Finally, we conduct extensive\nexperiments to demonstrate the advantages and properties of our proposed SAM.\nWe first show how SAM plays a primary role in the champion solution of two\nsubtasks of SemEval'21 Task 7.

While this task was previously\nrendered through expensive and time-consuming human labor, we present this\nnovel task of automatic naturalness evaluation of generated language. By\nfine-tuning the BERT model, our proposed naturalness evaluation method shows\nrobust results and outperforms the baselines: support vector machines,\nbi-directional LSTMs, and BLEURT. In addition, the training speed and\nevaluation performance of naturalness model are improved by transfer learning\nfrom quality and informativeness linguistic knowledge.",

          "description": "This paper explores augmenting monolingual data for knowledge distillation in\nneural machine translation. Source language monolingual text can be\nincorporated as a forward translation. Interestingly, we find the best way to\nincorporate target language monolingual text is to translate it to the source\nlanguage and round-trip translate it back to the target language, resulting in\na fully synthetic corpus. We find that combining monolingual data from both\nsource and target languages yields better performance than a corpus twice as\nlarge only in one language. Moreover, experiments reveal that the improvement\ndepends upon the provenance of the test set. If the test set was originally in\nthe source language (with the target side written by translators), then forward\ntranslating source monolingual data matters.

Our\nframework is capable of performing explainable reasoning without the need of\nany corpus-specific annotations, such as the ground-truth reasoning chain, or\nhuman-annotated entity mentions. Specifically, we first generate reasoning\nchains from a semantic graph constructed by Abstract Meaning Representation of\nretrieved evidence facts. A \\textit{Chain-aware loss}, concerning both local\nand global chain information, is also designed to enable the generated chains\nto serve as distant supervision signals for training the retriever, where\nreinforcement learning is also adopted to maximize the utility of the reasoning\nchains. Our framework allows the retriever to capture step-by-step clues of the\nentire reasoning process, which is not only shown to be effective on two\nchallenging multi-hop Science QA tasks, namely OpenBookQA and ARC-Challenge,\nbut also favors explainability.",

Online toxicity -\nan umbrella term for online hateful behavior, manifests itself in forms such as\nonline hate speech. Hate speech is a deliberate attack directed towards an\nindividual or a group motivated by the targeted entity's identity or opinions.\nThe rising mass communication through social media further exacerbates the\nharmful consequences of online hate speech. While there has been significant\nresearch on hate-speech identification using Natural Language Processing (NLP),\nthe work on utilizing NLP for prevention and intervention of online hate speech\nlacks relatively. This paper presents a holistic conceptual framework on\nhate-speech NLP countering methods along with a thorough survey on the current\nprogress of NLP for countering online hate speech. It classifies the countering\ntechniques based on their time of action, and identifies potential future\nresearch areas on this topic.",

The lower level of the hierarchy models modality-specific word\nrepresentations through dedicated but communicating graphs, while the higher\nlevel puts these representations together on a single graph to learn a\nrepresentation jointly from both modalities. The topology of each graph models\nsimilarity relations among words, and is estimated jointly with the graph\nembedding. The assumption underlying this model is that words sharing similar\nmeaning correspond to communities in an underlying similarity graph in a\nlow-dimensional space.

To\ncollect labels of human perception, we curate a new dataset, Hummingbird, on\ntop of benchmarking style datasets. We have crowd workers highlight the\nrepresentative words in the text that makes them think the text has the\nfollowing styles: politeness, sentiment, offensiveness, and five emotion types.\nWe then compare these human word labels with word importance derived from a\npopular fine-tuned style classifier like BERT.

          "description": "Pretrained contextualized representations offer great success for many\ndownstream tasks, including document ranking. The multilingual versions of such\npretrained representations provide a possibility of jointly learning many\nlanguages with the same model. Although it is expected to gain big with such\njoint training, in the case of cross lingual information retrieval (CLIR), the\nmodels under a multilingual setting are not achieving the same level of\nperformance as those under a monolingual setting. We hypothesize that the\nperformance drop is due to the translation gap between query and documents. In\nthe monolingual retrieval task, because of the same lexical inputs, it is\neasier for model to identify the query terms that occurred in documents.\nHowever, in the multilingual pretrained models that the words in different\nlanguages are projected into the same hyperspace, the model tends to translate\nquery terms into related terms, i.e., terms that appear in a similar context,\nin addition to or sometimes rather than synonyms in the target language. This\nproperty is creating difficulties for the model to connect terms that cooccur\nin both query and document. To address this issue, we propose a novel Mixed\nAttention Transformer (MAT) that incorporates external word level knowledge,\nsuch as a dictionary or translation table. We design a sandwich like\narchitecture to embed MAT into the recent transformer based deep neural models.\nBy encoding the translation knowledge into an attention matrix, the model with\nMAT is able to focus on the mutually translated words in the input sequence.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the external knowledge\nand the significant improvement of MAT embedded neural reranking model on CLIR\ntask.",

Recent works only propose lightweight model updates as models may\nalready possess useful knowledge from past experience, but a challenge remains\nin understanding what parts and to what extent models should be refined for a\ngiven task. In this paper, we investigate what models learn from commonsense\nreasoning datasets. We measure the impact of three different adaptation methods\non the generalization and accuracy of models.

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural approach for information\nstatus classification. Our approach consists of a mention extraction component\nand an information status assignment component. During the inference time, our\nsystem takes a raw text as the input and generates mentions together with their\ninformation status. On the ISNotes corpus (Markert et al., 2012), we show that\nour information status assignment component achieves new state-of-the-art\nresults on fine-grained IS classification based on gold mentions. Furthermore,\nour system performs significantly better than other baselines for both mention\nextraction and fine-grained IS classification in the end-to-end setting.\nFinally, we apply our system on BASHI (Roesiger, 2018) and SciCorp (Roesiger,\n2016) to recognize referential bridging anaphora. We find that our end-to-end\nsystem trained on ISNotes achieves competitive results on bridging anaphora\nrecognition compared to the previous state-of-the-art system that relies on\nsyntactic information and is trained on the in-domain datasets (Yu and Poesio,\n2020).",

          "description": "Toxic comment classification models are often found biased toward identity\nterms which are terms characterizing a specific group of people such as\n\"Muslim\" and \"black\". Such bias is commonly reflected in false-positive\npredictions, i.e. non-toxic comments with identity terms. In this work, we\npropose a novel approach to tackle such bias in toxic comment classification,\nleveraging the notion of subjectivity level of a comment and the presence of\nidentity terms. We hypothesize that when a comment is made about a group of\npeople that is characterized by an identity term, the likelihood of that\ncomment being toxic is associated with the subjectivity level of the comment,\ni.e. the extent to which the comment conveys personal feelings and opinions.\nBuilding upon the BERT model, we propose a new structure that is able to\nleverage these features, and thoroughly evaluate our model on 4 datasets of\nvarying sizes and representing different social media platforms.

In text-to-table, given a text, one creates a table or several\ntables expressing the main content of the text, while the model is learned from\ntext-table pair data. The problem setting differs from those of the existing\nmethods for IE. First, the extraction can be carried out from long texts to\nlarge tables with complex structures. Second, the extraction is entirely\ndata-driven, and there is no need to explicitly define the schemas. As far as\nwe know, there has been no previous work that studies the problem. In this\nwork, we formalize text-to-table as a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) problem.\nWe first employ a seq2seq model fine-tuned from a pre-trained language model to\nperform the task. We also develop a new method within the seq2seq approach,\nexploiting two additional techniques in table generation: table constraint and\ntable relation embeddings. We make use of four existing table-to-text datasets\nin our experiments on text-to-table. Experimental results show that the vanilla\nseq2seq model can outperform the baseline methods of using relation extraction\nand named entity extraction. The results also show that our method can further\nboost the performances of the vanilla seq2seq model. We further discuss the\nmain challenges of the proposed task.

          "description": "Relation Extraction (RE) from tables is the task of identifying relations\nbetween pairs of columns of a table. Generally, RE models for this task require\nlabelled tables for training. These labelled tables can also be generated\nartificially from a Knowledge Graph (KG), which makes the cost to acquire them\nmuch lower in comparison to manual annotations. However, unlike real tables,\nthese synthetic tables lack associated metadata, such as, column-headers,\ncaptions, etc; this is because synthetic tables are created out of KGs that do\nnot store such metadata. Meanwhile, previous works have shown that metadata is\nimportant for accurate RE from tables. To address this issue, we propose\nmethods to artificially create some of this metadata for synthetic tables.\nAfterward, we experiment with a BERT-based model, in line with recently\npublished works, that takes as input a combination of proposed artificial\nmetadata and table content. Our empirical results show that this leads to an\nimprovement of 9\\%-45\\% in F1 score, in absolute terms, over 2 tabular\ndatasets.",

          "description": "Coherence is an important aspect of text quality and is crucial for ensuring\nits readability. It is essential desirable for outputs from text generation\nsystems like summarization, question answering, machine translation, question\ngeneration, table-to-text, etc. An automated coherence scoring model is also\nhelpful in essay scoring or providing writing feedback. A large body of\nprevious work has leveraged entity-based methods, syntactic patterns, discourse\nrelations, and more recently traditional deep learning architectures for text\ncoherence assessment. Previous work suffers from drawbacks like the inability\nto handle long-range dependencies, out-of-vocabulary words, or model sequence\ninformation. We hypothesize that coherence assessment is a cognitively complex\ntask that requires deeper models and can benefit from other related tasks.\nAccordingly, in this paper, we propose four different Transformer-based\narchitectures for the task: vanilla Transformer, hierarchical Transformer,\nmulti-task learning-based model, and a model with fact-based input\nrepresentation. Our experiments with popular benchmark datasets across multiple\ndomains on four different coherence assessment tasks demonstrate that our\nmodels achieve state-of-the-art results outperforming existing models by a good\nmargin.",

          "description": "The task of learning from only a few examples (called a few-shot setting) is\nof key importance and relevance to a real-world setting. For question answering\n(QA), the current state-of-the-art pre-trained models typically need\nfine-tuning on tens of thousands of examples to obtain good results. Their\nperformance degrades significantly in a few-shot setting (< 100 examples). To\naddress this, we propose a simple fine-tuning framework that leverages\npre-trained text-to-text models and is directly aligned with their pre-training\nframework. Specifically, we construct the input as a concatenation of the\nquestion, a mask token representing the answer span and a context. Given this\ninput, the model is fine-tuned using the same objective as that of its\npre-training objective. Through experimental studies on various few-shot\nconfigurations, we show that this formulation leads to significant gains on\nmultiple QA benchmarks (an absolute gain of 34.2 F1 points on average when\nthere are only 16 training examples). The gains extend further when used with\nlarger models (Eg:- 72.3 F1 on SQuAD using BART-large with only 32 examples)\nand translate well to a multilingual setting . On the multilingual TydiQA\nbenchmark, our model outperforms the XLM-Roberta-large by an absolute margin of\nupto 40 F1 points and an average of 33 F1 points in a few-shot setting (<= 64\ntraining examples). We conduct detailed ablation studies to analyze factors\ncontributing to these gains.",

Given an input, a target head is the head\nthat is selected for outputting the final prediction. In this work, we examine\nthe behaviour of non-target heads, that is, the output of heads when given\ninput that belongs to a different task than the one they were trained for. We\nfind that non-target heads exhibit emergent behaviour, which may either explain\nthe target task, or generalize beyond their original task. For example, in a\nnumerical reasoning task, a span extraction head extracts from the input the\narguments to a computation that results in a number generated by a target\ngenerative head. In addition, a summarization head that is trained with a\ntarget question answering head, outputs query-based summaries when given a\nquestion and a context from which the answer is to be extracted. This emergent\nbehaviour suggests that multi-task training leads to non-trivial extrapolation\nof skills, which can be harnessed for interpretability and generalization.",

We experiments with two classes of\nuncertainty measures on multilingual (16 languages with 4 settings) and\nmulti-domain settings (4 for in-domain and 2 for out-of-domain on\nEnglish-German translation) and demonstrate our approach MultiUAT substantially\noutperforms its baselines, including both static and dynamic strategies. We\nanalyze the cross-domain transfer and show the deficiency of static and\nsimilarity based methods.",

          "description": "Dialogue summarization has drawn much attention recently. Especially in the\ncustomer service domain, agents could use dialogue summaries to help boost\ntheir works by quickly knowing customer's issues and service progress. These\napplications require summaries to contain the perspective of a single speaker\nand have a clear topic flow structure, while neither are available in existing\ndatasets. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel Chinese dataset for\nCustomer Service Dialogue Summarization (CSDS). CSDS improves the abstractive\nsummaries in two aspects: (1) In addition to the overall summary for the whole\ndialogue, role-oriented summaries are also provided to acquire different\nspeakers' viewpoints. (2) All the summaries sum up each topic separately, thus\ncontaining the topic-level structure of the dialogue. We define tasks in CSDS\nas generating the overall summary and different role-oriented summaries for a\ngiven dialogue. Next, we compare various summarization methods on CSDS, and\nexperiment results show that existing methods are prone to generate redundant\nand incoherent summaries. Besides, the performance becomes much worse when\nanalyzing the performance on role-oriented summaries and topic structures. We\nhope that this study could benchmark Chinese dialogue summarization and benefit\nfurther studies.",

Past work has shown\nthat recurrent neural networks (RNNs) struggle to generalize on held-out\nalgorithmic or syntactic patterns without supervision or some inductive bias.\nTo remedy this, many papers have explored augmenting RNNs with various\ndifferentiable stacks, by analogy with finite automata and pushdown automata.\nIn this paper, we present a stack RNN model based on the recently proposed\nNondeterministic Stack RNN (NS-RNN) that achieves lower cross-entropy than all\nprevious stack RNNs on five context-free language modeling tasks (within 0.05\nnats of the information-theoretic lower bound), including a task in which the\nNS-RNN previously failed to outperform a deterministic stack RNN baseline. Our\nmodel assigns arbitrary positive weights instead of probabilities to stack\nactions, and we provide an analysis of why this improves training.

Given a sentence (unstructured text) and its graph, we use\ncontrastive learning to impose relation-related structure on the token-level\nrepresentations of the sentence obtained with a CharacterBERT (El Boukkouri et\nal.,2020) model. The resulting relation-aware sentence embeddings achieve\nstate-of-the-art results on the relation extraction task using only a simple\nKNN classifier, thereby demonstrating the success of the proposed method.\nAdditional visualization by a tSNE analysis shows the effectiveness of the\nlearned representation space compared to baselines.

          "description": "Transformer-based pre-trained language models boost the performance of\nopen-domain dialogue systems. Prior works leverage Transformer-based\npre-trained language models to generate texts with desired attributes in two\ngeneral approaches: (1) gradient-based methods: updating all latent\nrepresentations of pre-trained models with gradients from attribute models; (2)\nweighted-decoding methods: re-ranking beam candidates from pre-trained models\nwith attribute functions. However, gradient-based methods lead to high\ncomputation cost and can easily get overfitted on small training sets, while\nweighted-decoding methods are inherently constrained by the low-variance\nhigh-bias pre-trained model. In this work, we propose a novel approach to\ncontrol the generation of Transformer-based pre-trained language models: the\nSideControl framework, which leverages a novel control attributes loss to\nincorporate useful control signals, and is shown to perform well with very\nlimited training samples. We evaluate our proposed method on two benchmark\nopen-domain dialogue datasets, and results show that the SideControl framework\nhas better controllability, higher generation quality and better\nsample-efficiency than existing gradient-based and weighted-decoding baselines.",

          "description": "Language models trained on large-scale unfiltered datasets curated from the\nopen web acquire systemic biases, prejudices, and harmful views from their\ntraining data. We present a methodology for programmatically identifying and\nremoving harmful text from web-scale datasets. A pretrained language model is\nused to calculate the log-likelihood of researcher-written trigger phrases\nconditioned on a specific document, which is used to identify and filter\ndocuments from the dataset. We demonstrate that models trained on this filtered\ndataset exhibit lower propensity to generate harmful text, with a marginal\ndecrease in performance on standard language modeling benchmarks compared to\nunfiltered baselines. We provide a partial explanation for this performance gap\nby surfacing examples of hate speech and other undesirable content from\nstandard language modeling benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the generalization\nof this method and how trigger phrases which reflect specific values can be\nused by researchers to build language models which are more closely aligned\nwith their values.",

          "description": "Medical dialogue systems (MDSs) aim to assist doctors and patients with a\nrange of professional medical services, i.e., diagnosis, consultation, and\ntreatment. However, one-stop MDS is still unexplored because: (1) no dataset\nhas so large-scale dialogues contains both multiple medical services and\nfine-grained medical labels (i.e., intents, slots, values); (2) no model has\naddressed a MDS based on multiple-service conversations in a unified framework.\nIn this work, we first build a Multiple-domain Multiple-service medical\ndialogue (M^2-MedDialog)dataset, which contains 1,557 conversations between\ndoctors and patients, covering 276 types of diseases, 2,468 medical entities,\nand 3 specialties of medical services. To the best of our knowledge, it is the\nonly medical dialogue dataset that includes both multiple medical services and\nfine-grained medical labels. Then, we formulate a one-stop MDS as a\nsequence-to-sequence generation problem. We unify a MDS with causal language\nmodeling and conditional causal language modeling, respectively. Specifically,\nwe employ several pretrained models (i.e., BERT-WWM, BERT-MED, GPT2, and MT5)\nand their variants to get benchmarks on M^2-MedDialog dataset. We also propose\npseudo labeling and natural perturbation methods to expand M2-MedDialog dataset\nand enhance the state-of-the-art pretrained models. We demonstrate the results\nachieved by the benchmarks so far through extensive experiments on\nM2-MedDialog.

          "description": "We study the problem of query attribute value extraction, which aims to\nidentify named entities from user queries as diverse surface form attribute\nvalues and afterward transform them into formally canonical forms. Such a\nproblem consists of two phases: {named entity recognition (NER)} and {attribute\nvalue normalization (AVN)}. However, existing works only focus on the NER phase\nbut neglect equally important AVN. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a\nunified query attribute value extraction system in e-commerce search named\nQUEACO, which involves both two phases. Moreover, by leveraging large-scale\nweakly-labeled behavior data, we further improve the extraction performance\nwith less supervision cost. Specifically, for the NER phase, QUEACO adopts a\nnovel teacher-student network, where a teacher network that is trained on the\nstrongly-labeled data generates pseudo-labels to refine the weakly-labeled data\nfor training a student network. Meanwhile, the teacher network can be\ndynamically adapted by the feedback of the student's performance on\nstrongly-labeled data to maximally denoise the noisy supervisions from the weak\nlabels. For the AVN phase, we also leverage the weakly-labeled\nquery-to-attribute behavior data to normalize surface form attribute values\nfrom queries into canonical forms from products. Extensive experiments on a\nreal-world large-scale E-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of\nQUEACO.",

Little is known about the factors\ncontributing to their impressive performance and whether the\nover-parameterization is needed. In this work, we shed some light on the inner\nworking mechanisms of these large BERT-based models.

          "description": "The rapid growth in published clinical trials makes it difficult to maintain\nup-to-date systematic reviews, which requires finding all relevant trials. This\nleads to policy and practice decisions based on out-of-date, incomplete, and\nbiased subsets of available clinical evidence. Extracting and then normalising\nPopulation, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) information from\nclinical trial articles may be an effective way to automatically assign trials\nto systematic reviews and avoid searching and screening - the two most\ntime-consuming systematic review processes. We propose and test a novel\napproach to PICO span detection. The major difference between our proposed\nmethod and previous approaches comes from detecting spans without needing\nannotated span data and using only crowdsourced sentence-level annotations.\nExperiments on two datasets show that PICO span detection results achieve much\nhigher results for recall when compared to fully supervised methods with PICO\nsentence detection at least as good as human annotations. By removing the\nreliance on expert annotations for span detection, this work could be used in\nhuman-machine pipeline for turning low-quality crowdsourced, and sentence-level\nPICO annotations into structured information that can be used to quickly assign\ntrials to relevant systematic reviews.",

          "description": "In joint entity and relation extraction, existing work either sequentially\nencode task-specific features, leading to an imbalance in inter-task feature\ninteraction where features extracted later have no direct contact with those\nthat come first. Or they encode entity features and relation features in a\nparallel manner, meaning that feature representation learning for each task is\nlargely independent of each other except for input sharing. We propose a\npartition filter network to model two-way interaction between tasks properly,\nwhere feature encoding is decomposed into two steps: partition and filter. In\nour encoder, we leverage two gates: entity and relation gate, to segment\nneurons into two task partitions and one shared partition. The shared partition\nrepresents inter-task information valuable to both tasks and is evenly shared\nacross two tasks to ensure proper two-way interaction. The task partitions\nrepresent intra-task information and are formed through concerted efforts of\nboth gates, making sure that encoding of task-specific features is dependent\nupon each other. Experiment results on six public datasets show that our model\nperforms significantly better than previous approaches. In addition, contrary\nto what previous work claims, our auxiliary experiments suggest that relation\nprediction is contributory to named entity prediction in a non-negligible way.\nThe source code can be found at https://github.com/Coopercoppers/PFN.",

NLP models built with the conventional paradigm, however, often\nstruggle with generalization across tasks (e.g., a question-answering system\ncannot solve classification tasks). A long-standing challenge in AI is to build\na model that is equipped with the understanding of human-readable instructions\nthat define the tasks, and can generalize to new tasks. To study this, we\nintroduce NATURAL INSTRUCTIONS, a dataset of 61 distinct tasks, their\nhuman-authored instructions and 193k task instances. The instructions are\nobtained from crowdsourcing instructions used to collect existing NLP datasets\nand mapped to a unified schema. We adopt generative pre-trained language models\nto encode task-specific instructions along with input and generate task output.\nOur results indicate that models can benefit from instructions to generalize\nacross tasks.

          "description": "Over the past few years, various word-level textual attack approaches have\nbeen proposed to reveal the vulnerability of deep neural networks used in\nnatural language processing. Typically, these approaches involve an important\noptimization step to determine which substitute to be used for each word in the\noriginal input. However, current research on this step is still rather limited,\nfrom the perspectives of both problem-understanding and problem-solving. In\nthis paper, we address these issues by uncovering the theoretical properties of\nthe problem and proposing an efficient local search algorithm (LS) to solve it.\nWe establish the first provable approximation guarantee on solving the problem\nin general cases. Notably, for adversarial textual attack, it is even better\nthan the previous bound which only holds in special case. Extensive experiments\ninvolving five NLP tasks, six datasets and eleven NLP models show that LS can\nlargely reduce the number of queries usually by an order of magnitude to\nachieve high attack success rates. Further experiments show that the\nadversarial examples crafted by LS usually have higher quality, exhibit better\ntransferability, and can bring more robustness improvement to victim models by\nadversarial training.",

We show that\nfeed-forward layers in transformer-based language models operate as key-value\nmemories, where each key correlates with textual patterns in the training\nexamples, and each value induces a distribution over the output vocabulary. Our\nexperiments show that the learned patterns are human-interpretable, and that\nlower layers tend to capture shallow patterns, while upper layers learn more\nsemantic ones. The values complement the keys' input patterns by inducing\noutput distributions that concentrate probability mass on tokens likely to\nappear immediately after each pattern, particularly in the upper layers.\nFinally, we demonstrate that the output of a feed-forward layer is a\ncomposition of its memories, which is subsequently refined throughout the\nmodel's layers via residual connections to produce the final output\ndistribution.",

A common\napproach is to represent data objects as binary vectors, denoted \\textit{hash\ncodes}, which require little storage and enable efficient similarity search\nthrough direct indexing into a hash table or through similarity computations in\nan appropriate space. Due to the limited expressibility of hash codes, compared\nto real-valued representations, a core open challenge is how to generate hash\ncodes that well capture semantic content or latent properties using a small\nnumber of bits, while ensuring that the hash codes are distributed in a way\nthat does not reduce their search efficiency. State of the art methods use\nrepresentation learning for generating such hash codes, focusing on neural\nautoencoder architectures where semantics are encoded into the hash codes by\nlearning to reconstruct the original inputs of the hash codes. This thesis\naddresses the above challenge and makes a number of contributions to\nrepresentation learning that (i) improve effectiveness of hash codes through\nmore expressive representations and a more effective similarity measure than\nthe current state of the art, namely the Hamming distance, and (ii) improve\nefficiency of hash codes by learning representations that are especially suited\nto the choice of search method.

To this end, we propose a novel method using sampling\ntechniques based on submodular optimization and optimal transport for active\nlearning in language models, dubbed ALLWAS. We construct a sampling strategy\nbased on submodular optimization of the designed objective in the gradient\ndomain. Furthermore, to enable learning from few samples, we propose a novel\nstrategy for sampling from the Wasserstein barycenters. Our empirical\nevaluations on standard benchmark datasets for text classification show that\nour methods perform significantly better (>20% relative increase in some cases)\nthan existing approaches for active learning on language models.",

          "description": "Neural network models are resource hungry. It is difficult to deploy such\ndeep networks on devices with limited resources, like smart wearables,\ncellphones, drones, and autonomous vehicles. Low bit quantization such as\nbinary and ternary quantization is a common approach to alleviate this resource\nrequirements. Ternary quantization provides a more flexible model and\noutperforms binary quantization in terms of accuracy, however doubles the\nmemory footprint and increases the computational cost. Contrary to these\napproaches, mixed quantized models allow a trade-off between accuracy and\nmemory footprint. In such models, quantization depth is often chosen manually,\nor is tuned using a separate optimization routine. The latter requires training\na quantized network multiple times. Here, we propose an adaptive combination of\nbinary and ternary quantization, namely Smart Quantization (SQ), in which the\nquantization depth is modified directly via a regularization function, so that\nthe model is trained only once. Our experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod adapts quantization depth successfully while keeping the model accuracy\nhigh on MNIST and CIFAR10 benchmarks.",

          "description": "Employing large-scale pre-trained model CLIP to conduct video-text retrieval\ntask (VTR) has become a new trend, which exceeds previous VTR methods. Though,\ndue to the heterogeneity of structures and contents between video and text,\nprevious CLIP-based models are prone to overfitting in the training phase,\nresulting in relatively poor retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a\nmulti-stream Corpus Alignment network with single gate Mixture-of-Experts\n(CAMoE) and a novel Dual Softmax Loss (DSL) to solve the two heterogeneity. The\nCAMoE employs Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to extract multi-perspective video\nrepresentations, including action, entity, scene, etc., then align them with\nthe corresponding part of the text. In this stage, we conduct massive\nexplorations towards the feature extraction module and feature alignment\nmodule. DSL is proposed to avoid the one-way optimum-match which occurs in\nprevious contrastive methods. Introducing the intrinsic prior of each pair in a\nbatch, DSL serves as a reviser to correct the similarity matrix and achieves\nthe dual optimal match. DSL is easy to implement with only one-line code but\nimproves significantly. The results show that the proposed CAMoE and DSL are of\nstrong efficiency, and each of them is capable of achieving State-of-The-Art\n(SOTA) individually on various benchmarks such as MSR-VTT, MSVD, and LSMDC.\nFurther, with both of them, the performance is advanced to a big extend,\nsurpassing the previous SOTA methods for around 4.6\\% R@1 in MSR-VTT.",

          "description": "We formulate a practical yet challenging problem: General Partial Label\nLearning (GPLL). Compared to the traditional Partial Label Learning (PLL)\nproblem, GPLL relaxes the supervision assumption from instance-level -- a label\nset partially labels an instance -- to group-level: 1) a label set partially\nlabels a group of instances, where the within-group instance-label link\nannotations are missing, and 2) cross-group links are allowed -- instances in a\ngroup may be partially linked to the label set from another group. Such\nambiguous group-level supervision is more practical in real-world scenarios as\nadditional annotation on the instance-level is no longer required, e.g.,\nface-naming in videos where the group consists of faces in a frame, labeled by\na name set in the corresponding caption. In this paper, we propose a novel\ngraph convolutional network (GCN) called Dual Bipartite Graph Autoencoder\n(DB-GAE) to tackle the label ambiguity challenge of GPLL. First, we exploit the\ncross-group correlations to represent the instance groups as dual bipartite\ngraphs: within-group and cross-group, which reciprocally complements each other\nto resolve the linking ambiguities. Second, we design a GCN autoencoder to\nencode and decode them, where the decodings are considered as the refined\nresults. It is worth noting that DB-GAE is self-supervised and transductive, as\nit only uses the group-level supervision without a separate offline training\nstage. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DB-GAE\nsignificantly outperforms the best baseline over absolute 0.159 F1-score and\n24.8% accuracy. We further offer analysis on various levels of label\nambiguities.",

          "description": "Detecting distracted driving behaviours is important to reduce millions of\ndeaths and injuries occurring worldwide. Distracted or anomalous driving\nbehaviours are deviations from the 'normal' driving that need to be identified\ncorrectly to alert the driver. However, these driving behaviours do not\ncomprise of one specific type of driving style and their distribution can be\ndifferent during training and testing phases of a classifier. We formulate this\nproblem as a supervised contrastive learning approach to learn a visual\nrepresentation to detect normal, and seen and unseen anomalous driving\nbehaviours. We made a change to the standard contrastive loss function to\nadjust the similarity of negative pairs to aid the optimization. Normally, the\n(self) supervised contrastive framework contains an encoder followed by a\nprojection head, which is omitted during testing phase as the encoding layers\nare considered to contain general visual representative information. However,\nwe assert that for supervised contrastive learning task, including projection\nhead will be beneficial. We showed our results on a Driver Anomaly Detection\ndataset that contains 783 minutes of video recordings of normal and anomalous\ndriving behaviours of 31 drivers from various from top and front cameras (both\ndepth and infrared). We also performed an extra step of fine tuning the labels\nin this dataset. Out of 9 video modalities combinations, our modified\ncontrastive approach improved the ROC AUC on 7 in comparison to the baseline\nmodels (from 3.12% to 8.91% for different modalities); the remaining two models\nalso had manual labelling. We performed statistical tests that showed evidence\nthat our modifications perform better than the baseline contrastive models.\nFinally, the results showed that the fusion of depth and infrared modalities\nfrom top and front view achieved the best AUC ROC of 0.9738 and AUC PR of\n0.9772.",

          "description": "In object re-identification (ReID), the development of deep learning\ntechniques often involves model updates and deployment. It is unbearable to\nre-embedding and re-index with the system suspended when deploying new models.\nTherefore, backward-compatible representation is proposed to enable \"new\"\nfeatures to be compared with \"old\" features directly, which means that the\ndatabase is active when there are both \"new\" and \"old\" features in it. Thus we\ncan scroll-refresh the database or even do nothing on the database to update.\n\nThe existing backward-compatible methods either require a strong overlap\nbetween old and new training data or simply conduct constraints at the instance\nlevel. Thus they are difficult in handling complicated cluster structures and\nare limited in eliminating the impact of outliers in old embeddings, resulting\nin a risk of damaging the discriminative capability of new features. In this\nwork, we propose a Neighborhood Consensus Contrastive Learning (NCCL) method.\nWith no assumptions about the new training data, we estimate the sub-cluster\nstructures of old embeddings. A new embedding is constrained with multiple old\nembeddings in both embedding space and discrimination space at the sub-class\nlevel. The effect of outliers diminished, as the multiple samples serve as\n\"mean teachers\". Besides, we also propose a scheme to filter the old embeddings\nwith low credibility, further improving the compatibility robustness. Our\nmethod ensures backward compatibility without impairing the accuracy of the new\nmodel. And it can even improve the new model's accuracy in most scenarios.",

          "description": "Vehicle Re-identification (ReID) is an important yet challenging problem in\ncomputer vision. Compared to other visual objects like faces and persons,\nvehicles simultaneously exhibit much larger intraclass viewpoint variations and\ninterclass visual similarities, making most exiting loss functions designed for\nface recognition and person ReID unsuitable for vehicle ReID. To obtain a\nhigh-performance vehicle ReID model, we present a novel Distance Shrinking with\nAngular Marginalizing (DSAM) loss function to perform hybrid learning in both\nthe Original Feature Space (OFS) and the Feature Angular Space (FAS) using the\nlocal verification and the global identification information. Specifically, it\nshrinks the distance between samples of the same class locally in the Original\nFeature Space while keeps samples of different classes far away in the Feature\nAngular Space. The shrinking and marginalizing operations are performed during\neach iteration of the training process and are suitable for different SoftMax\nbased loss functions. We evaluate the DSAM loss function on three large vehicle\nReID datasets with detailed analyses and extensive comparisons with many\ncompeting vehicle ReID methods.

          "description": "Nowadays, scene text recognition has attracted more and more attention due to\nits various applications. Most state-of-the-art methods adopt an\nencoder-decoder framework with attention mechanism, which generates text\nautoregressively from left to right. Despite the convincing performance, the\nspeed is limited because of the one-by-one decoding strategy. As opposed to\nautoregressive models, non-autoregressive models predict the results in\nparallel with a much shorter inference time, but the accuracy falls behind the\nautoregressive counterpart considerably. In this paper, we propose a Parallel,\nIterative and Mimicking Network (PIMNet) to balance accuracy and efficiency.\nSpecifically, PIMNet adopts a parallel attention mechanism to predict the text\nfaster and an iterative generation mechanism to make the predictions more\naccurate. In each iteration, the context information is fully explored. To\nimprove learning of the hidden layer, we exploit the mimicking learning in the\ntraining phase, where an additional autoregressive decoder is adopted and the\nparallel decoder mimics the autoregressive decoder with fitting outputs of the\nhidden layer. With the shared backbone between the two decoders, the proposed\nPIMNet can be trained end-to-end without pre-training. During inference, the\nbranch of the autoregressive decoder is removed for a faster speed. Extensive\nexperiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency\nof PIMNet.

          "description": "Learning the similarity between images constitutes the foundation for\nnumerous vision tasks. The common paradigm is discriminative metric learning,\nwhich seeks an embedding that separates different training classes. However,\nthe main challenge is to learn a metric that not only generalizes from training\nto novel, but related, test samples. It should also transfer to different\nobject classes. So what complementary information is missed by the\ndiscriminative paradigm? Besides finding characteristics that separate between\nclasses, we also need them to likely occur in novel categories, which is\nindicated if they are shared across training classes. This work investigates\nhow to learn such characteristics without the need for extra annotations or\ntraining data. By formulating our approach as a novel triplet sampling\nstrategy, it can be easily applied on top of recent ranking loss frameworks.\nExperiments show that, independent of the underlying network architecture and\nthe specific ranking loss, our approach significantly improves performance in\ndeep metric learning, leading to new the state-of-the-art results on various\nstandard benchmark datasets.

          "description": "Automatic building segmentation is an important task for satellite imagery\nanalysis and scene understanding. Most existing segmentation methods focus on\nthe case where the images are taken from directly overhead (i.e., low\noff-nadir/viewing angle). These methods often fail to provide accurate results\non satellite images with larger off-nadir angles due to the higher noise level\nand lower spatial resolution. In this paper, we propose a method that is able\nto provide accurate building segmentation for satellite imagery captured from a\nlarge range of off-nadir angles. Based on Bayesian deep learning, we explicitly\ndesign our method to learn the data noise via aleatoric and epistemic\nuncertainty modeling. Satellite image metadata (e.g., off-nadir angle and\nground sample distance) is also used in our model to further improve the\nresult. We show that with uncertainty modeling and metadata injection, our\nmethod achieves better performance than the baseline method, especially for\nnoisy images taken from large off-nadir angles.",

As the name\nsuggests, this new model is derived by isolating the topmost layer from the\nremainder of the neural network, followed by imposing certain constraints\nseparately on the two parts of the network. We demonstrate that the\nLayer-Peeled Model, albeit simple, inherits many characteristics of\nwell-trained neural networks, thereby offering an effective tool for explaining\nand predicting common empirical patterns of deep learning training. First, when\nworking on class-balanced datasets, we prove that any solution to this model\nforms a simplex equiangular tight frame, which in part explains the recently\ndiscovered phenomenon of neural collapse \\cite{papyan2020prevalence}. More\nimportantly, when moving to the imbalanced case, our analysis of the\nLayer-Peeled Model reveals a hitherto unknown phenomenon that we term\n\\textit{Minority Collapse}, which fundamentally limits the performance of deep\nlearning models on the minority classes. In addition, we use the Layer-Peeled\nModel to gain insights into how to mitigate Minority Collapse.

          "description": "Like many scientific fields, new chemistry literature has grown at a\nstaggering pace, with thousands of papers released every month. A large portion\nof chemistry literature focuses on new molecules and reactions between\nmolecules. Most vital information is conveyed through 2-D images of molecules,\nrepresenting the underlying molecules or reactions described. In order to\nensure reproducible and machine-readable molecule representations, text-based\nmolecule descriptors like SMILES and SELFIES were created. These text-based\nmolecule representations provide molecule generation but are unfortunately\nrarely present in published literature. In the absence of molecule descriptors,\nthe generation of molecule descriptors from the 2-D images present in the\nliterature is necessary to understand chemistry literature at scale. Successful\nmethods such as Optical Structure Recognition Application (OSRA), and\nChemSchematicResolver are able to extract the locations of molecules structures\nin chemistry papers and infer molecular descriptions and reactions. While\neffective, existing systems expect chemists to correct outputs, making them\nunsuitable for unsupervised large-scale data mining. Leveraging the task\nformulation of image captioning introduced by DECIMER, we introduce IMG2SMI, a\nmodel which leverages Deep Residual Networks for image feature extraction and\nan encoder-decoder Transformer layers for molecule description generation.\nUnlike previous Neural Network-based systems, IMG2SMI builds around the task of\nmolecule description generation, which enables IMG2SMI to outperform OSRA-based\nsystems by 163% in molecule similarity prediction as measured by the molecular\nMACCS Fingerprint Tanimoto Similarity. Additionally, to facilitate further\nresearch on this task, we release a new molecule prediction dataset. including\n81 million molecules for molecule description generation",

          "description": "In this study, we introduce a measure for machine perception, inspired by the\nconcept of Just Noticeable Difference (JND) of human perception. Based on this\nmeasure, we suggest an adversarial image generation algorithm, which\niteratively distorts an image by an additive noise until the model detects the\nchange in the image by outputting a false label. The noise added to the\noriginal image is defined as the gradient of the cost function of the model. A\nnovel cost function is defined to explicitly minimize the amount of\nperturbation applied to the input image while enforcing the perceptual\nsimilarity between the adversarial and input images. For this purpose, the cost\nfunction is regularized by the well-known total variation and bounded range\nterms to meet the natural appearance of the adversarial image. We evaluate the\nadversarial images generated by our algorithm both qualitatively and\nquantitatively on CIFAR10, ImageNet, and MS COCO datasets. Our experiments on\nimage classification and object detection tasks show that adversarial images\ngenerated by our JND method are both more successful in deceiving the\nrecognition/detection models and less perturbed compared to the images\ngenerated by the state-of-the-art methods, namely, FGV, FSGM, and DeepFool\nmethods.",

          "description": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently received explosive popularity, but\nthe huge computational cost is still a severe issue. Since the computation\ncomplexity of ViT is quadratic with respect to the input sequence length, a\nmainstream paradigm for computation reduction is to reduce the number of\ntokens. Existing designs include structured spatial compression that uses a\nprogressive shrinking pyramid to reduce the computations of large feature maps,\nand unstructured token pruning that dynamically drops redundant tokens.\nHowever, the limitation of existing token pruning lies in two folds: 1) the\nincomplete spatial structure caused by pruning is not compatible with\nstructured spatial compression that is commonly used in modern deep-narrow\ntransformers; 2) it usually requires a time-consuming pre-training procedure.\nTo tackle the limitations and expand the applicable scenario of token pruning,\nwe present Evo-ViT, a self-motivated slow-fast token evolution approach for\nvision transformers. Specifically, we conduct unstructured instance-wise token\nselection by taking advantage of the simple and effective global class\nattention that is native to vision transformers. Then, we propose to update the\nselected informative tokens and uninformative tokens with different computation\npaths, namely, slow-fast updating. Since slow-fast updating mechanism maintains\nthe spatial structure and information flow, Evo-ViT can accelerate vanilla\ntransformers of both flat and deep-narrow structures from the very beginning of\nthe training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly reduces the computational cost of vision transformers while\nmaintaining comparable performance on image classification.",

          "description": "Narrated instructional videos often show and describe manipulations of\nsimilar objects, e.g., repairing a particular model of a car or laptop. In this\nwork we aim to reconstruct such objects and to localize associated narrations\nin 3D. Contrary to the standard scenario of instance-level 3D reconstruction,\nwhere identical objects or scenes are present in all views, objects in\ndifferent instructional videos may have large appearance variations given\nvarying conditions and versions of the same product. Narrations may also have\nlarge variation in natural language expressions. We address these challenges by\nthree contributions. First, we propose an approach for correspondence\nestimation combining learnt local features and dense flow. Second, we design a\ntwo-step divide and conquer reconstruction approach where the initial 3D\nreconstructions of individual videos are combined into a 3D alignment graph.\nFinally, we propose an unsupervised approach to ground natural language in\nobtained 3D reconstructions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach\nfor the domain of car maintenance. Given raw instructional videos and no manual\nsupervision, our method successfully reconstructs engines of different car\nmodels and associates textual descriptions with corresponding objects in 3D.",

          "description": "Detection faults in seismic data is a crucial step for seismic structural\ninterpretation, reservoir characterization and well placement. Some recent\nworks regard it as an image segmentation task. The task of image segmentation\nrequires huge labels, especially 3D seismic data, which has a complex structure\nand lots of noise. Therefore, its annotation requires expert experience and a\nhuge workload. In this study, we present lambda-BCE and lambda-smooth L1loss to\neffectively train 3D-CNN by some slices from 3D seismic data, so that the model\ncan learn the segmentation of 3D seismic data from a few 2D slices. In order to\nfully extract information from limited data and suppress seismic noise, we\npropose an attention module that can be used for active supervision training\nand embedded in the network. The attention heatmap label is generated by the\noriginal label, and letting it supervise the attention module using the\nlambda-smooth L1loss. The experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of our loss\nfunction, the method can extract 3D seismic features from a few 2D slice\nlabels. And it also shows the advanced performance of the attention module,\nwhich can significantly suppress the noise in the seismic data while increasing\nthe model's sensitivity to the foreground. Finally, on the public test set, we\nonly use the 2D slice labels training that accounts for 3.3% of the 3D volume\nlabel, and achieve similar performance to the 3D volume label training.",

Most of the existing methods in literature require a large amount\nof fully labeled training data, but it is extremely time-consuming to obtain\nthese training data by manually labeling massive point clouds. Addressing this\nproblem, we propose a superpoint-guided semi-supervised segmentation network\nfor 3D point clouds, which jointly utilizes a small portion of labeled scene\npoint clouds and a large number of unlabeled point clouds for network training.\nThe proposed network is iteratively updated with its predicted pseudo labels,\nwhere a superpoint generation module is introduced for extracting superpoints\nfrom 3D point clouds, and a pseudo-label optimization module is explored for\nautomatically assigning pseudo labels to the unlabeled points under the\nconstraint of the extracted superpoints. Additionally, there are some 3D points\nwithout pseudo-label supervision. We propose an edge prediction module to\nconstrain features of edge points. A superpoint feature aggregation module and\na superpoint feature consistency loss function are introduced to smooth\nsuperpoint features.

As an\nautomotive supercomputer, ProAI delivers an excellent combination of\nperformance and efficiency, managing nearly twice the number of FPS per watt\nthan a modern workstation laptop and almost four times compared to the Jetson\nNano.

          "description": "Since many safety-critical systems, such as surgical robots and autonomous\ndriving cars operate in unstable environments with sensor noise and incomplete\ndata, it is desirable for object detectors to take the localization uncertainty\ninto account. However, there are several limitations of the existing\nuncertainty estimation methods for anchor-based object detection. 1) They model\nthe uncertainty of the heterogeneous object properties with different\ncharacteristics and scales, such as location (center point) and scale (width,\nheight), which could be difficult to estimate. 2) They model box offsets as\nGaussian distributions, which is not compatible with the ground truth bounding\nboxes that follow the Dirac delta distribution. 3) Since anchor-based methods\nare sensitive to anchor hyperparameters, the localization uncertainty for them\ncould be also highly sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters as well. To\ntackle these limitations, we propose a new localization uncertainty estimation\nmethod called UAD for anchor-free object detection. Our method captures the\nuncertainty in four directions of box offsets~(left, right, top, bottom) that\nare homogeneous, so that it can tell which direction is uncertain, and provides\na quantitative value of uncertainty in $[0, 1]$. To enable such uncertainty\nestimation, we design a new uncertainty loss, negative power log-likelihood\nloss, to measure the localization uncertainty by weighting the likelihood loss\nby its IoU, which alleviates the model misspecification problem. Furthermore,\nwe propose an uncertainty-aware focal loss for reflecting the estimated\nuncertainty to the classification score. Experimental results on COCO datasets\ndemonstrate that our method significantly improves FCOS, by up to 1.8 points,\nwithout sacrificing computational efficiency.",

In contrast, textual imaging reports, which are often readily\navailable in medical records, contain rich but unstructured interpretations\nwritten by experts as part of standard clinical practice. We propose using\nthese textual reports as a form of weak supervision to improve the image\ninterpretation performance of a neural network without requiring additional\nmanually labeled examples. We use an image-text matching task to train a\nfeature extractor and then fine-tune it in a transfer learning setting for a\nsupervised task using a small labeled dataset. The end result is a neural\nnetwork that automatically interprets imagery without requiring textual reports\nduring inference. This approach can be applied to any task for which text-image\npairs are readily available.

In order to\naddress these concerns, we conduct an extensive analysis using formalized group\nfairness metrics. We find systematic disparities in cropping and identify\ncontributing factors, including the fact that the cropping based on the single\nmost salient point can amplify the disparities because of an effect we term\nargmax bias. However, we demonstrate that formalized fairness metrics and\nquantitative analysis on their own are insufficient for capturing the risk of\nrepresentational harm in automatic cropping. We suggest the removal of\nsaliency-based cropping in favor of a solution that better preserves user\nagency.

Attack vectors cause not only image classifiers to\nfail, but also collaterally disrupt incidental structure in the image. We\ndemonstrate that modifying the attacked image to restore the natural structure\nwill reverse many types of attacks, providing a defense. Experiments\ndemonstrate significantly improved robustness for several state-of-the-art\nmodels across the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets. Our results\nshow that our defense is still effective even if the attacker is aware of the\ndefense mechanism. Since our defense is deployed during inference instead of\ntraining, it is compatible with pre-trained networks as well as most other\ndefenses. Our results suggest deep networks are vulnerable to adversarial\nexamples partly because their representations do not enforce the natural\nstructure of images.",

          "description": "Reconstructing 3D object from a single image (RGB or depth) is a fundamental\nproblem in visual scene understanding and yet remains challenging due to its\nill-posed nature and complexity in real-world scenes. To address those\nchallenges, we adopt a primitive-based representation for 3D object, and\npropose a two-stage graph network for primitive-based 3D object estimation,\nwhich consists of a sequential proposal module and a graph reasoning module.\nGiven a 2D image, our proposal module first generates a sequence of 3D\nprimitives from input image with local feature attention. Then the graph\nreasoning module performs joint reasoning on a primitive graph to capture the\nglobal shape context for each primitive. Such a framework is capable of taking\ninto account rich geometry and semantic constraints during 3D structure\nrecovery, producing 3D objects with more coherent structure even under\nchallenging viewing conditions. We train the entire graph neural network in a\nstage-wise strategy and evaluate it on three benchmarks: Pix3D, ModelNet and\nNYU Depth V2.

Generally, existing multi-modal datasets are\neither limited in scale or modality diversity. Differently, our M5Product is\nfeatured from the following aspects. First, the M5Product dataset is 500 times\nlarger than the public multimodal dataset with the same number of modalities\nand nearly twice larger compared with the largest available text-image\ncross-modal dataset. Second, the dataset contains rich information of multiple\nmodalities including image, text, table, video and audio, in which each\nmodality can capture different views of semantic information (e.g. category,\nattributes, affordance, brand, preference) and complements the other. Third, to\nbetter accommodate with real-world problems, a few portion of M5Product\ncontains incomplete modality pairs and noises while having the long-tailed\ndistribution, which aligns well with real-world scenarios. Finally, we provide\na baseline model M5-MMT that makes the first attempt to integrate the different\nmodality configuration into an unified model for feature fusion to address the\ngreat challenge for semantic alignment. We also evaluate various multi-model\npre-training state-of-the-arts for benchmarking their capabilities in learning\nfrom unlabeled data under the different number of modalities on the M5Product\ndataset.

Firstly, speed-up robust feature (SURF) descriptor in log-polar space\nand scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) descriptor are extracted from an\nentire forged image. Secondly, generalized 2 nearest neighbor (g2NN) is\nemployed to get massive matched pairs. Then, random sample consensus (RANSAC)\nalgorithm is employed to filter out mismatched pairs, thus allowing rough\nlocalization of the counterfeit areas. To present more accurately these forgery\nareas more accurately, we propose an efficient and accurate algorithm, evolving\ncircular domains coverage (ECDC), to cover present them. This algorithm aims to\nfind satisfactory threshold areas by extracting block features from jointly\nevolving circular domains, which are centered on the matched pairs.

          "description": "Correctly capturing intraoperative brain shift in image-guided neurosurgical\nprocedures is a critical task for aligning preoperative data with\nintraoperative geometry, ensuring effective surgical navigation and optimal\nsurgical precision. While the finite element method (FEM) is a proven technique\nto effectively approximate soft tissue deformation through biomechanical\nformulations, their degree of success boils down to a trade-off between\naccuracy and speed. To circumvent this problem, the most recent works in this\ndomain have proposed leveraging data-driven models obtained by training various\nmachine learning algorithms, e.g. random forests, artificial neural networks\n(ANNs), with the results of finite element analysis (FEA) to speed up tissue\ndeformation approximations by prediction. These methods, however, do not\naccount for the structure of the finite element (FE) mesh during training that\nprovides information on node connectivities as well as the distance between\nthem, which can aid with approximating tissue deformation based on the\nproximity of force load points with the rest of the mesh nodes. Therefore, this\nwork proposes a novel framework, PhysGNN, a data-driven model that approximates\nthe solution of FEA by leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs), which are\ncapable of accounting for the mesh structural information and inductive\nlearning over unstructured grids and complex topological structures.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate that the proposed architecture, PhysGNN, promises\naccurate and fast soft tissue deformation approximations while remaining\ncomputationally feasible, suitable for neurosurgical settings.",

However, the task of\nstreet scene semantic segmentation requires expensive annotations. Furthermore,\nsegmentation algorithms are often trained irrespective of the actual driving\ntask, using auxiliary image-space loss functions which are not guaranteed to\nmaximize driving metrics such as safety or distance traveled per intervention.\nIn this work, we seek to quantify the impact of reducing segmentation\nannotation costs on learned behavior cloning agents. We analyze several\nsegmentation-based intermediate representations. We use these visual\nabstractions to systematically study the trade-off between annotation\nefficiency and driving performance, i.e., the types of classes labeled, the\nnumber of image samples used to learn the visual abstraction model, and their\ngranularity (e.g., object masks vs. 2D bounding boxes). Our analysis uncovers\nseveral practical insights into how segmentation-based visual abstractions can\nbe exploited in a more label efficient manner. Surprisingly, we find that\nstate-of-the-art driving performance can be achieved with orders of magnitude\nreduction in annotation cost. Beyond label efficiency, we find several\nadditional training benefits when leveraging visual abstractions, such as a\nsignificant reduction in the variance of the learned policy when compared to\nstate-of-the-art end-to-end driving models.",

          "description": "With the advent of advances in self-supervised learning, paired clean-noisy\ndata are no longer required in deep learning-based image denoising. However,\nexisting blind denoising methods still require the assumption with regard to\nnoise characteristics, such as zero-mean noise distribution and pixel-wise\nnoise-signal independence; this hinders wide adaptation of the method in the\nmedical domain. On the other hand, unpaired learning can overcome limitations\nrelated to the assumption on noise characteristics, which makes it more\nfeasible for collecting the training data in real-world scenarios. In this\npaper, we propose a novel image denoising scheme, Interdependent\nSelf-Cooperative Learning (ISCL), that leverages unpaired learning by combining\ncyclic adversarial learning with self-supervised residual learning. Unlike the\nexisting unpaired image denoising methods relying on matching data\ndistributions in different domains, the two architectures in ISCL, designed for\ndifferent tasks, complement each other and boost the learning process. To\nassess the performance of the proposed method, we conducted extensive\nexperiments in various biomedical image degradation scenarios, such as noise\ncaused by physical characteristics of electron microscopy (EM) devices (film\nand charging noise), and structural noise found in low-dose computer tomography\n(CT). We demonstrate that the image quality of our method is superior to\nconventional and current state-of-the-art deep learning-based image denoising\nmethods, including supervised learning.",

          "description": "Existing person re-identification (re-id) methods are stuck when deployed to\na new unseen scenario despite the success in cross-camera person matching.\nRecent efforts have been substantially devoted to domain adaptive person re-id\nwhere extensive unlabeled data in the new scenario are utilized in a\ntransductive learning manner. However, for each scenario, it is required to\nfirst collect enough data and then train such a domain adaptive re-id model,\nthus restricting their practical application. Instead, we aim to explore\nmultiple labeled datasets to learn generalized domain-invariant representations\nfor person re-id, which is expected universally effective for each new-coming\nre-id scenario. To pursue practicability in real-world systems, we collect all\nthe person re-id datasets (20 datasets) in this field and select the three most\nfrequently used datasets (i.e., Market1501, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17) as unseen\ntarget domains. In addition, we develop DataHunter that collects over 300K+\nweak annotated images named YouTube-Human from YouTube street-view videos,\nwhich joins 17 remaining full labeled datasets to form multiple source domains.\nOn such a large and challenging benchmark called FastHuman (~440K+ labeled\nimages), we further propose a simple yet effective Semi-Supervised Knowledge\nDistillation (SSKD) framework. SSKD effectively exploits the weakly annotated\ndata by assigning soft pseudo labels to YouTube-Human to improve models'\ngeneralization ability. Experiments on several protocols verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed SSKD framework on domain generalizable person\nre-id, which is even comparable to supervised learning on the target domains.\nLastly, but most importantly, we hope the proposed benchmark FastHuman could\nbring the next development of domain generalizable person re-id algorithms.",

          "description": "Deep metric learning (DML) is a cornerstone of many computer vision\napplications. It aims at learning a mapping from the input domain to an\nembedding space, where semantically similar objects are located nearby and\ndissimilar objects far from another. The target similarity on the training data\nis defined by user in form of ground-truth class labels. However, while the\nembedding space learns to mimic the user-provided similarity on the training\ndata, it should also generalize to novel categories not seen during training.\nBesides user-provided groundtruth training labels, a lot of additional visual\nfactors (such as viewpoint changes or shape peculiarities) exist and imply\ndifferent notions of similarity between objects, affecting the generalization\non the images unseen during training. However, existing approaches usually\ndirectly learn a single embedding space on all available training data,\nstruggling to encode all different types of relationships, and do not\ngeneralize well. We propose to build a more expressive representation by\njointly splitting the embedding space and the data hierarchically into smaller\nsub-parts. We successively focus on smaller subsets of the training data,\nreducing its variance and learning a different embedding subspace for each data\nsubset. Moreover, the subspaces are learned jointly to cover not only the\nintricacies, but the breadth of the data as well. Only after that, we build the\nfinal embedding from the subspaces in the conquering stage. The proposed\nalgorithm acts as a transparent wrapper that can be placed around arbitrary\nexisting DML methods. Our approach significantly improves upon the\nstate-of-the-art on image retrieval, clustering, and re-identification tasks\nevaluated using CUB200-2011, CARS196, Stanford Online Products, In-shop\nClothes, and PKU VehicleID datasets.",

We propose a diagnostic method based\non cross-modal input ablation to assess the extent to which these models\nactually integrate cross-modal information. This method involves ablating\ninputs from one modality, either entirely or selectively based on cross-modal\ngrounding alignments, and evaluating the model prediction performance on the\nother modality. Model performance is measured by modality-specific tasks that\nmirror the model pretraining objectives (e.g. masked language modelling for\ntext). Models that have learned to construct cross-modal representations using\nboth modalities are expected to perform worse when inputs are missing from a\nmodality.

In this paper, we posit that adversarial attacks on transformers\nshould be specially tailored for their architecture, jointly considering both\npatches and self-attention, in order to achieve high transferability. More\nspecifically, we introduce a dual attack framework, which contains a Pay No\nAttention (PNA) attack and a PatchOut attack, to improve the transferability of\nadversarial samples across different ViTs. We show that skipping the gradients\nof attention during backpropagation can generate adversarial examples with high\ntransferability. In addition, adversarial perturbations generated by optimizing\nrandomly sampled subsets of patches at each iteration achieve higher attack\nsuccess rates than attacks using all patches. We evaluate the transferability\nof attacks on state-of-the-art ViTs, CNNs and robustly trained CNNs. The\nresults of these experiments demonstrate that the proposed dual attack can\ngreatly boost transferability between ViTs and from ViTs to CNNs.

          "description": "Facial editing is an important task in vision and graphics with numerous\napplications. However, existing works are incapable to deliver a continuous and\nfine-grained editing mode (e.g., editing a slightly smiling face to a big\nlaughing one) with natural interactions with users. In this work, we propose\nTalk-to-Edit, an interactive facial editing framework that performs\nfine-grained attribute manipulation through dialog between the user and the\nsystem. Our key insight is to model a continual \"semantic field\" in the GAN\nlatent space. 1) Unlike previous works that regard the editing as traversing\nstraight lines in the latent space, here the fine-grained editing is formulated\nas finding a curving trajectory that respects fine-grained attribute landscape\non the semantic field. 2) The curvature at each step is location-specific and\ndetermined by the input image as well as the users' language requests. 3) To\nengage the users in a meaningful dialog, our system generates language feedback\nby considering both the user request and the current state of the semantic\nfield.\n\nWe also contribute CelebA-Dialog, a visual-language facial editing dataset to\nfacilitate large-scale study. Specifically, each image has manually annotated\nfine-grained attribute annotations as well as template-based textual\ndescriptions in natural language. Extensive quantitative and qualitative\nexperiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework in terms of 1) the\nsmoothness of fine-grained editing, 2) the identity/attribute preservation, and\n3) the visual photorealism and dialog fluency.

          "description": "Deep learning has achieved remarkable progress for visual recognition on\nlarge-scale balanced datasets but still performs poorly on real-world\nlong-tailed data. Previous methods often adopt class re-balanced training\nstrategies to effectively alleviate the imbalance issue, but might be a risk of\nover-fitting tail classes. The recent decoupling method overcomes over-fitting\nissues by using a multi-stage training scheme, yet, it is still incapable of\ncapturing tail class information in the feature learning stage. In this paper,\nwe show that soft label can serve as a powerful solution to incorporate label\ncorrelation into a multi-stage training scheme for long-tailed recognition. The\nintrinsic relation between classes embodied by soft labels turns out to be\nhelpful for long-tailed recognition by transferring knowledge from head to tail\nclasses.\n\nSpecifically, we propose a conceptually simple yet particularly effective\nmulti-stage training scheme, termed as Self Supervised to Distillation (SSD).\nThis scheme is composed of two parts. First, we introduce a self-distillation\nframework for long-tailed recognition, which can mine the label relation\nautomatically. Second, we present a new distillation label generation module\nguided by self-supervision. The distilled labels integrate information from\nboth label and data domains that can model long-tailed distribution\neffectively.

          "description": "Most recent semantic segmentation methods adopt a U-Net framework with an\nencoder-decoder architecture. It is still challenging for U-Net with a simple\nskip connection scheme to model the global multi-scale context: 1) Not each\nskip connection setting is effective due to the issue of incompatible feature\nsets of encoder and decoder stage, even some skip connection negatively\ninfluence the segmentation performance; 2) The original U-Net is worse than the\none without any skip connection on some datasets. Based on our findings, we\npropose a new segmentation framework, named UCTransNet (with a proposed CTrans\nmodule in U-Net), from the channel perspective with attention mechanism.\nSpecifically, the CTrans module is an alternate of the U-Net skip connections,\nwhich consists of a sub-module to conduct the multi-scale Channel Cross fusion\nwith Transformer (named CCT) and a sub-module Channel-wise Cross-Attention\n(named CCA) to guide the fused multi-scale channel-wise information to\neffectively connect to the decoder features for eliminating the ambiguity.\nHence, the proposed connection consisting of the CCT and CCA is able to replace\nthe original skip connection to solve the semantic gaps for an accurate\nautomatic medical image segmentation. The experimental results suggest that our\nUCTransNet produces more precise segmentation performance and achieves\nconsistent improvements over the state-of-the-art for semantic segmentation\nacross different datasets and conventional architectures involving transformer\nor U-shaped framework.

Three different languages are acquired in\nthis dataset to include the problem of language dependency of the speaker\nrecognition systems.

          "description": "Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID) are ubiquitous in several\nmanufacturing, oil and gas enterprises for representing engineering schematics\nand equipment layout. There is an urgent need to extract and digitize\ninformation from P&IDs without the cost of annotating a varying set of symbols\nfor each new use case. A robust one-shot learning approach for symbol\nrecognition i.e., localization followed by classification, would therefore go a\nlong way towards this goal. Our method works by sampling pixels sequentially\nalong the different contour boundaries in the image. These sampled points form\npaths which are used in the prototypical line diagram to construct a graph that\ncaptures the structure of the contours. Subsequently, the prototypical graphs\nare fed into a Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) which is\ntrained to classify graphs into one of the given symbol classes. Further, we\nappend embeddings from a Resnet-34 network which is trained on symbol images\ncontaining sampled points to make the classification network more robust.\nSince, many symbols in P&ID are structurally very similar to each other, we\nutilize Arcface loss during DGCNN training which helps in maximizing symbol\nclass separability by producing highly discriminative embeddings. The images\nconsist of components attached on the pipeline (straight line). The sampled\npoints segregated around the symbol regions are used for the classification\ntask. The proposed pipeline, named OSSR-PID, is fast and gives outstanding\nperformance for recognition of symbols on a synthetic dataset of 100 P&ID\ndiagrams. We also compare our method against prior-work on a real-world private\ndataset of 12 P&ID sheets and obtain comparable/superior results. Remarkably,\nit is able to achieve such excellent performance using only one prototypical\nexample per symbol.",

          "description": "Deep learning models usually require a large amount of labeled data to\nachieve satisfactory performance. In multimedia analysis, domain adaptation\nstudies the problem of cross-domain knowledge transfer from a label rich source\ndomain to a label scarce target domain, thus potentially alleviates the\nannotation requirement for deep learning models. However, we find that\ncontemporary domain adaptation methods for cross-domain image understanding\nperform poorly when source domain is noisy. Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation\n(WSDA) studies the domain adaptation problem under the scenario where source\ndata can be noisy. Prior methods on WSDA remove noisy source data and align the\nmarginal distribution across domains without considering the fine-grained\nsemantic structure in the embedding space, which have the problem of class\nmisalignment, e.g., features of cats in the target domain might be mapped near\nfeatures of dogs in the source domain. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmethod, termed Noise Tolerant Domain Adaptation, for WSDA. Specifically, we\nadopt the cluster assumption and learn cluster discriminatively with class\nprototypes in the embedding space. We propose to leverage the location\ninformation of the data points in the embedding space and model the location\ninformation with a Gaussian mixture model to identify noisy source data. We\nthen design a network which incorporates the Gaussian mixture noise model as a\nsub-module for unsupervised noise removal and propose a novel cluster-level\nadversarial adaptation method which aligns unlabeled target data with the less\nnoisy class prototypes for mapping the semantic structure across domains. We\nconduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method on\nboth general images and medical images from COVID-19 and e-commerce datasets.\nThe results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nWSDA methods.",

          "description": "While post-training quantization receives popularity mostly due to its\nevasion in accessing the original complete training dataset, its poor\nperformance also stems from this limitation. To alleviate this limitation, in\nthis paper, we leverage the synthetic data introduced by zero-shot quantization\nwith calibration dataset and we propose a fine-grained data distribution\nalignment (FDDA) method to boost the performance of post-training quantization.\nThe method is based on two important properties of batch normalization\nstatistics (BNS) we observed in deep layers of the trained network, i.e.,\ninter-class separation and intra-class incohesion. To preserve this\nfine-grained distribution information: 1) We calculate the per-class BNS of the\ncalibration dataset as the BNS centers of each class and propose a\nBNS-centralized loss to force the synthetic data distributions of different\nclasses to be close to their own centers. 2) We add Gaussian noise into the\ncenters to imitate the incohesion and propose a BNS-distorted loss to force the\nsynthetic data distribution of the same class to be close to the distorted\ncenters. By introducing these two fine-grained losses, our method shows the\nstate-of-the-art performance on ImageNet, especially when the first and last\nlayers are quantized to low-bit as well.

          "description": "This work studies the problem of high-dimensional data (referred to tensors)\ncompletion from partially observed samplings. We consider that a tensor is a\nsuperposition of multiple low-rank components. In particular, each component\ncan be represented as multilinear connections over several latent factors and\nnaturally mapped to a specific tensor network (TN) topology. In this paper, we\npropose a fundamental tensor decomposition (TD) framework: Multi-Tensor Network\nRepresentation (MTNR), which can be regarded as a linear combination of a range\nof TD models, e.g., CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition, Tensor Train (TT),\nand Tensor Ring (TR). Specifically, MTNR represents a high-order tensor as the\naddition of multiple TN models, and the topology of each TN is automatically\ngenerated instead of manually pre-designed. For the optimization phase, an\nadaptive topology learning (ATL) algorithm is presented to obtain latent\nfactors of each TN based on a rank incremental strategy and a projection error\nmeasurement strategy. In addition, we theoretically establish the fundamental\nmultilinear operations for the tensors with TN representation, and reveal the\nstructural transformation of MTNR to a single TN. Finally, MTNR is applied to a\ntypical task, tensor completion, and two effective algorithms are proposed for\nthe exact recovery of incomplete data based on the Alternating Least Squares\n(ALS) scheme and Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM) framework.\nExtensive numerical experiments on synthetic data and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of MTNR compared with the start-of-the-art\nmethods.",

          "description": "Biometric systems are vulnerable to the Presentation Attacks (PA) performed\nusing various Presentation Attack Instruments (PAIs). Even though there are\nnumerous Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) techniques based on both deep\nlearning and hand-crafted features, the generalization of PAD for unknown PAI\nis still a challenging problem. The common problem with existing deep\nlearning-based PAD techniques is that they may struggle with local optima,\nresulting in weak generalization against different PAs. In this work, we\npropose to use self-supervised learning to find a reasonable initialization\nagainst local trap, so as to improve the generalization ability in detecting\nPAs on the biometric system.The proposed method, denoted as IF-OM, is based on\na global-local view coupled with De-Folding and De-Mixing to derive the\ntask-specific representation for PAD.During De-Folding, the proposed technique\nwill learn region-specific features to represent samples in a local pattern by\nexplicitly maximizing cycle consistency. While, De-Mixing drives detectors to\nobtain the instance-specific features with global information for more\ncomprehensive representation by maximizing topological consistency. Extensive\nexperimental results show that the proposed method can achieve significant\nimprovements in terms of both face and fingerprint PAD in more complicated and\nhybrid datasets, when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Specifically,\nwhen training in CASIA-FASD and Idiap Replay-Attack, the proposed method can\nachieve 18.60% Equal Error Rate (EER) in OULU-NPU and MSU-MFSD, exceeding\nbaseline performance by 9.54%.

Furthermore,\nwe demonstrate that judging a model by a single evaluation metric can be\nmisleading by developing an additional model adding local self-attention which\nscores a higher IS, outperforming the state of the art on the CUB dataset, but\ngenerates unrealistic images through feature repetition.",

The purpose\nof this study is to develop an improved iterative neural network (INN) for\nhigh-quality image-domain material decomposition in DECT, and to study its\nproperties. We propose a new INN architecture for DECT material decomposition.\nThe proposed INN architecture uses distinct cross-material convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) in image refining modules, and uses image decomposition physics\nin image reconstruction modules. The distinct cross-material CNN refiners\nincorporate distinct encoding-decoding filters and cross-material model that\ncaptures correlations between different materials. We study the distinct\ncross-material CNN refiner with patch-based reformulation and tight-frame\ncondition. Numerical experiments with extended cardiactorso (XCAT) phantom and\nclinical data show that the proposed INN significantly improves the image\nquality over several image-domain material decomposition methods, including a\nconventional model-based image decomposition (MBID) method using an\nedge-preserving regularizer, a recent MBID method using pre-learned\nmaterial-wise sparsifying transforms, and a noniterative deep CNN method.

          "description": "Image translation methods typically aim to manipulate a set of labeled\nattributes (given as supervision at training time e.g. domain label) while\nleaving the unlabeled attributes intact. Current methods achieve either: (i)\ndisentanglement, which exhibits low visual fidelity and can only be satisfied\nwhere the attributes are perfectly uncorrelated. (ii) visually-plausible\ntranslations, which are clearly not disentangled. In this work, we propose\nOverLORD, a single framework for disentangling labeled and unlabeled attributes\nas well as synthesizing high-fidelity images, which is composed of two stages;\n(i) Disentanglement: Learning disentangled representations with latent\noptimization. Differently from previous approaches, we do not rely on\nadversarial training or any architectural biases. (ii) Synthesis: Training\nfeed-forward encoders for inferring the learned attributes and tuning the\ngenerator in an adversarial manner to increase the perceptual quality. When the\nlabeled and unlabeled attributes are correlated, we model an additional\nrepresentation that accounts for the correlated attributes and improves\ndisentanglement. We highlight that our flexible framework covers multiple\nsettings as disentangling labeled attributes, pose and appearance, localized\nconcepts, and shape and texture.

          "description": "One-stage object detectors rely on a point feature to predict the detection\nresults. However, the point feature often lacks the information of the whole\nobject, thereby leading to a misalignment between the object and the point\nfeature. Meanwhile, the classification and regression tasks are sensitive to\ndifferent object regions, but their features are spatially aligned. Both of\nthese two problems hinder the detection performance. In order to solve these\ntwo problems, we propose a simple and plug-in operator that can generate\naligned and disentangled features for each task, respectively, without breaking\nthe fully convolutional manner. By predicting two task-aware point sets that\nare located in each sensitive region, the proposed operator can align the point\nfeature with the object and disentangle the two tasks from the spatial\ndimension. We also reveal an interesting finding of the opposite effect of the\nlong-range skip connection for classification and regression. On the basis of\nthe Object-Aligned and Task-disentangled operator (OAT), we propose OAT-Net,\nwhich explicitly exploits point-set features for accurate detection results.\nExtensive experiments on the MS-COCO dataset show that OAT can consistently\nboost different state-of-the-art one-stage detectors by $\\sim$2 AP.

To\nfacilitate integrity learning for salient object detection, we design a novel\nIntegrity Cognition Network (ICON), which explores three important components\nto learn strong integrity features. 1) Unlike the existing models that focus\nmore on feature discriminability, we introduce a diverse feature aggregation\n(DFA) component to aggregate features with various receptive fields (i.e.,,\nkernel shape and context) and increase the feature diversity. Such diversity is\nthe foundation for mining the integral salient objects. 2) Based on the DFA\nfeatures, we introduce the integrity channel enhancement (ICE) component with\nthe goal of enhancing feature channels that highlight the integral salient\nobjects at the macro level, while suppressing the other distracting ones. 3)\nAfter extracting the enhanced features, the part-whole verification (PWV)\nmethod is employed to determine whether the part and whole object features have\nstrong agreement.

First, we propose a new margin-based min-max surrogate loss\nfunction for the AUC score (named as AUC min-max-margin loss or simply AUC\nmargin loss for short). It is more robust than the commonly used AUC square\nloss, while enjoying the same advantage in terms of large-scale stochastic\noptimization. Second, we conduct extensive empirical studies of our DAM method\non four difficult medical image classification tasks, namely (i) classification\nof chest x-ray images for identifying many threatening diseases, (ii)\nclassification of images of skin lesions for identifying melanoma, (iii)\nclassification of mammogram for breast cancer screening, and (iv)\nclassification of microscopic images for identifying tumor tissue. Our studies\ndemonstrate that the proposed DAM method improves the performance of optimizing\ncross-entropy loss by a large margin, and also achieves better performance than\noptimizing the existing AUC square loss on these medical image classification\ntasks. Specifically, our DAM method has achieved the 1st place on Stanford\nCheXpert competition on Aug. 31, 2020. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first work that makes DAM succeed on large-scale medical image datasets. We\nalso conduct extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the advantages of the\nnew AUC margin loss over the AUC square loss on benchmark datasets. The\nproposed method is implemented in our open-sourced library LibAUC\n(www.libauc.org).",

          "description": "Object manipulation from 3D visual inputs poses many challenges on building\ngeneralizable perception and policy models. However, 3D assets in existing\nbenchmarks mostly lack the diversity of 3D shapes that align with real-world\nintra-class complexity in topology and geometry. Here we propose SAPIEN\nManipulation Skill Benchmark (ManiSkill) to benchmark manipulation skills over\ndiverse objects in a full-physics simulator. 3D assets in ManiSkill include\nlarge intra-class topological and geometric variations. Tasks are carefully\nchosen to cover distinct types of manipulation challenges. Latest progress in\n3D vision also makes us believe that we should customize the benchmark so that\nthe challenge is inviting to researchers working on 3D deep learning. To this\nend, we simulate a moving panoramic camera that returns ego-centric point\nclouds or RGB-D images. In addition, we would like ManiSkill to serve a broad\nset of researchers interested in manipulation research. Besides supporting the\nlearning of policies from interactions, we also support\nlearning-from-demonstrations (LfD) methods, by providing a large number of\nhigh-quality demonstrations (~36,000 successful trajectories, ~1.5M point\ncloud/RGB-D frames in total). We provide baselines using 3D deep learning and\nLfD algorithms.

          "description": "Choroid plexuses (CP) are structures of the ventricles of the brain which\nproduce most of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Several postmortem and in vivo\nstudies have pointed towards their role in the inflammatory process in multiple\nsclerosis (MS). Automatic segmentation of CP from MRI thus has high value for\nstudying their characteristics in large cohorts of patients. To the best of our\nknowledge, the only freely available tool for CP segmentation is FreeSurfer but\nits accuracy for this specific structure is poor. In this paper, we propose to\nautomatically segment CP from non-contrast enhanced T1-weighted MRI. To that\nend, we introduce a new model called \"Axial-MLP\" based on an assembly of Axial\nmulti-layer perceptrons (MLPs). This is inspired by recent works which showed\nthat the self-attention layers of Transformers can be replaced with MLPs. This\napproach is systematically compared with a standard 3D U-Net, nnU-Net,\nFreesurfer and FastSurfer. For our experiments, we make use of a dataset of 141\nsubjects (44 controls and 97 patients with MS). We show that all the tested\ndeep learning (DL) methods outperform FreeSurfer (Dice around 0.7 for DL vs\n0.33 for FreeSurfer). Axial-MLP is competitive with U-Nets even though it is\nslightly less accurate. The conclusions of our paper are two-fold: 1) the\nstudied deep learning methods could be useful tools to study CP in large\ncohorts of MS patients; 2)~Axial-MLP is a potentially viable alternative to\nconvolutional neural networks for such tasks, although it could benefit from\nfurther improvements.",

In this work, we develop a technique to derive explainable\nsaliency models from their corresponding deep neural architecture based\nsaliency models by applying human perception theories and the conventional\nconcepts of saliency. This technique helps us understand the learning pattern\nof the deep network at its intermediate layers through their activation maps.\nInitially, we consider two state-of-the-art deep saliency models, namely UNISAL\nand MSI-Net for our interpretation. We use a set of biologically plausible\nlog-gabor filters for identifying and reconstructing the activation maps of\nthem using our explainable saliency model. The final saliency map is generated\nusing these reconstructed activation maps. We also build our own deep saliency\nmodel named cross-concatenated multi-scale residual block based network\n(CMRNet) for saliency prediction. Then, we evaluate and compare the performance\nof the explainable models derived from UNISAL, MSI-Net and CMRNet on three\nbenchmark datasets with other state-of-the-art methods.

The proposed magnetic\nresonance-guided deep decoder (MR-GDD) utilizes the spatial details and\nsemantic features of MR-guidance image more effectively by introducing\nencoder-decoder and deep decoder subnetworks. Moreover, the specific shapes and\npatterns of the guidance image do not affect the denoised PET image, because\nthe guidance image is input to the network through an attention gate.

          "description": "Vision-based depth estimation is a key feature in autonomous systems, which\noften relies on a single camera or several independent ones. In such a\nmonocular setup, dense depth is obtained with either additional input from one\nor several expensive LiDARs, e.g., with 64 beams, or camera-only methods, which\nsuffer from scale-ambiguity and infinite-depth problems. In this paper, we\npropose a new alternative of densely estimating metric depth by combining a\nmonocular camera with a light-weight LiDAR, e.g., with 4 beams, typical of\ntoday's automotive-grade mass-produced laser scanners. Inspired by recent\nself-supervised methods, we introduce a novel framework, called LiDARTouch, to\nestimate dense depth maps from monocular images with the help of ``touches'' of\nLiDAR, i.e., without the need for dense ground-truth depth. In our setup, the\nminimal LiDAR input contributes on three different levels: as an additional\nmodel's input, in a self-supervised LiDAR reconstruction objective function,\nand to estimate changes of pose (a key component of self-supervised depth\nestimation architectures). Our LiDARTouch framework achieves new state of the\nart in self-supervised depth estimation on the KITTI dataset, thus supporting\nour choices of integrating the very sparse LiDAR signal with other visual\nfeatures. Moreover, we show that the use of a few-beam LiDAR alleviates scale\nambiguity and infinite-depth issues that camera-only methods suffer from. We\nalso demonstrate that methods from the fully-supervised depth-completion\nliterature can be adapted to a self-supervised regime with a minimal LiDAR\nsignal.",

          "description": "Face anti-spoofing is essential to prevent false facial verification by using\na photo, video, mask, or a different substitute for an authorized person's\nface. Most of the state-of-the-art presentation attack detection (PAD) systems\nsuffer from overfitting, where they achieve near-perfect scores on a single\ndataset but fail on a different dataset with more realistic data. This problem\ndrives researchers to develop models that perform well under real-world\nconditions. This is an especially challenging problem for frame-based\npresentation attack detection systems that use convolutional neural networks\n(CNN). To this end, we propose a new PAD approach, which combines pixel-wise\nbinary supervision with patch-based CNN. We believe that training a CNN with\nface patches allows the model to distinguish spoofs without learning background\nor dataset-specific traces. We tested the proposed method both on the standard\nbenchmark datasets -- Replay-Mobile, OULU-NPU -- and on a real-world dataset.\nThe proposed approach shows its superiority on challenging experimental setups.\nNamely, it achieves higher performance on OULU-NPU protocol 3, 4 and on\ninter-dataset real-world experiments.",

With the gating mechanism to build fine\nproposal features and the self-attention mechanism to model relationships, our\nmethod can produce high-quality predictions with a small computation budget in\nan end-to-end manner.

The data mining technique of anomaly detection\nincludes unsupervised approaches that do not require rare samples for training\nclassifiers.

The manner in which the\nsensor contacts a stimulus is entangled with the tactile information about the\ngeometry of the stimulus. In this work, we propose a supervised convolutional\ndeep neural network model that learns to disentangle, in the latent space, the\ncomponents of sensor deformations caused by contact geometry from those due to\nsliding-induced shear. The approach is validated by reconstructing unsheared\ntactile images from sheared images and showing they match unsheared tactile\nimages collected with no sliding motion. In addition, the unsheared tactile\nimages give a faithful reconstruction of the contact geometry that is not\npossible from the sheared data, and robust estimation of the contact pose that\ncan be used for servo control sliding around various 2D shapes. Finally, the\ncontact geometry reconstruction in conjunction with servo control sliding were\nused for faithful full object reconstruction of various 2D shapes.

          "description": "Due to the large success in object detection and instance segmentation, Mask\nR-CNN attracts great attention and is widely adopted as a strong baseline for\narbitrary-shaped scene text detection and spotting. However, two issues remain\nto be settled. The first is dense text case, which is easy to be neglected but\nquite practical. There may exist multiple instances in one proposal, which\nmakes it difficult for the mask head to distinguish different instances and\ndegrades the performance. In this work, we argue that the performance\ndegradation results from the learning confusion issue in the mask head. We\npropose to use an MLP decoder instead of the \"deconv-conv\" decoder in the mask\nhead, which alleviates the issue and promotes robustness significantly. And we\npropose instance-aware mask learning in which the mask head learns to predict\nthe shape of the whole instance rather than classify each pixel to text or\nnon-text. With instance-aware mask learning, the mask branch can learn\nseparated and compact masks. The second is that due to large variations in\nscale and aspect ratio, RPN needs complicated anchor settings, making it hard\nto maintain and transfer across different datasets. To settle this issue, we\npropose an adaptive label assignment in which all instances especially those\nwith extreme aspect ratios are guaranteed to be associated with enough anchors.\nEquipped with these components, the proposed method named MAYOR achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks including DAST1500, MSRA-TD500,\nICDAR2015, CTW1500, and Total-Text.",

          "description": "Early and accurate severity assessment of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nbased on computed tomography (CT) images offers a great help to the estimation\nof intensive care unit event and the clinical decision of treatment planning.\nTo augment the labeled data and improve the generalization ability of the\nclassification model, it is necessary to aggregate data from multiple sites.\nThis task faces several challenges including class imbalance between mild and\nsevere infections, domain distribution discrepancy between sites, and presence\nof heterogeneous features. In this paper, we propose a novel domain adaptation\n(DA) method with two components to address these problems. The first component\nis a stochastic class-balanced boosting sampling strategy that overcomes the\nimbalanced learning problem and improves the classification performance on\npoorly-predicted classes. The second component is a representation learning\nthat guarantees three properties: 1) domain-transferability by prototype\ntriplet loss, 2) discriminant by conditional maximum mean discrepancy loss, and\n3) completeness by multi-view reconstruction loss. Particularly, we propose a\ndomain translator and align the heterogeneous data to the estimated class\nprototypes (i.e., class centers) in a hyper-sphere manifold. Experiments on\ncross-site severity assessment of COVID-19 from CT images show that the\nproposed method can effectively tackle the imbalanced learning problem and\noutperform recent DA approaches.",

          "description": "This paper presents a method of learning Local-GlObal Contextual Adaptation\nfor fully end-to-end and fast bottom-up human Pose estimation, dubbed as\nLOGO-CAP. It is built on the conceptually simple center-offset formulation that\nlacks inaccuracy for pose estimation. When revisiting the bottom-up human pose\nestimation with the thought of \"thinking, fast and slow\" by D. Kahneman, we\nintroduce a \"slow keypointer\" to remedy the lack of sufficient accuracy of the\n\"fast keypointer\". In learning the \"slow keypointer\", the proposed LOGO-CAP\nlifts the initial \"fast\" keypoints by offset predictions to keypoint expansion\nmaps (KEMs) to counter their uncertainty in two modules. Firstly, the local\nKEMs (e.g., 11x11) are extracted from a low-dimensional feature map. A proposed\nconvolutional message passing module learns to \"re-focus\" the local KEMs to the\nkeypoint attraction maps (KAMs) by accounting for the structured output\nprediction nature of human pose estimation, which is directly supervised by the\nobject keypoint similarity (OKS) loss in training. Secondly, the global KEMs\nare extracted, with a sufficiently large region-of-interest (e.g., 97x97), from\nthe keypoint heatmaps that are computed by a direct map-to-map regression.\nThen, a local-global contextual adaptation module is proposed to convolve the\nglobal KEMs using the learned KAMs as the kernels. This convolution can be\nunderstood as the learnable offsets guided deformable and dynamic convolution\nin a pose-sensitive way. The proposed method is end-to-end trainable with near\nreal-time inference speed, obtaining state-of-the-art performance on the COCO\nkeypoint benchmark for bottom-up human pose estimation. With the COCO trained\nmodel, our LOGO-CAP also outperforms prior arts by a large margin on the\nchallenging OCHuman dataset.",

However, recent studies have indicated that both digital and\nphysical adversarial examples can fool neural networks. Face-recognition\nsystems are used in various applications that involve security threats from\nphysical adversarial examples. Herein, we propose a physical adversarial attack\nwith the use of full-face makeup. The presence of makeup on the human face is a\nreasonable possibility, which possibly increases the imperceptibility of\nattacks. In our attack framework, we combine the cycle-adversarial generative\nnetwork (cycle-GAN) and a victimized classifier. The Cycle-GAN is used to\ngenerate adversarial makeup, and the architecture of the victimized classifier\nis VGG 16. Our experimental results show that our attack can effectively\novercome manual errors in makeup application, such as color and\nposition-related errors. We also demonstrate that the approaches used to train\nthe models can influence physical attacks; the adversarial perturbations\ncrafted from the pre-trained model are affected by the corresponding training\ndata.",

          "description": "Astounding results from Transformer models on natural language tasks have\nintrigued the vision community to study their application to computer vision\nproblems. Among their salient benefits, Transformers enable modeling long\ndependencies between input sequence elements and support parallel processing of\nsequence as compared to recurrent networks e.g., Long short-term memory (LSTM).\nDifferent from convolutional networks, Transformers require minimal inductive\nbiases for their design and are naturally suited as set-functions. Furthermore,\nthe straightforward design of Transformers allows processing multiple\nmodalities (e.g., images, videos, text and speech) using similar processing\nblocks and demonstrates excellent scalability to very large capacity networks\nand huge datasets. These strengths have led to exciting progress on a number of\nvision tasks using Transformer networks. This survey aims to provide a\ncomprehensive overview of the Transformer models in the computer vision\ndiscipline. We start with an introduction to fundamental concepts behind the\nsuccess of Transformers i.e., self-attention, large-scale pre-training, and\nbidirectional encoding. We then cover extensive applications of transformers in\nvision including popular recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, object\ndetection, action recognition, and segmentation), generative modeling,\nmulti-modal tasks (e.g., visual-question answering, visual reasoning, and\nvisual grounding), video processing (e.g., activity recognition, video\nforecasting), low-level vision (e.g., image super-resolution, image\nenhancement, and colorization) and 3D analysis (e.g., point cloud\nclassification and segmentation). We compare the respective advantages and\nlimitations of popular techniques both in terms of architectural design and\ntheir experimental value. Finally, we provide an analysis on open research\ndirections and possible future works.",

          "description": "We propose the first general and scalable framework to design certifiable\nalgorithms for robust geometric perception in the presence of outliers. Our\nfirst contribution is to show that estimation using common robust costs, such\nas truncated least squares (TLS), maximum consensus, Geman-McClure, Tukey's\nbiweight, among others, can be reformulated as polynomial optimization problems\n(POPs). By focusing on the TLS cost, our second contribution is to exploit\nsparsity in the POP and propose a sparse semidefinite programming (SDP)\nrelaxation that is much smaller than the standard Lasserre's hierarchy while\npreserving exactness, i.e., the SDP recovers the optimizer of the nonconvex POP\nwith an optimality certificate. Our third contribution is to solve the SDP\nrelaxations at an unprecedented scale and accuracy by presenting STRIDE, a\nsolver that blends global descent on the convex SDP with fast local search on\nthe nonconvex POP. Our fourth contribution is an evaluation of the proposed\nframework on six geometric perception problems including single and multiple\nrotation averaging, point cloud and mesh registration, absolute pose\nestimation, and category-level object pose and shape estimation. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that (i) our sparse SDP relaxation is exact with up to\n60%-90% outliers across applications; (ii) while still being far from\nreal-time, STRIDE is up to 100 times faster than existing SDP solvers on\nmedium-scale problems, and is the only solver that can solve large-scale SDPs\nwith hundreds of thousands of constraints to high accuracy; (iii) STRIDE\nprovides a safeguard to existing fast heuristics for robust estimation (e.g.,\nRANSAC or Graduated Non-Convexity), i.e., it certifies global optimality if the\nheuristic estimates are optimal, or detects and allows escaping local optima\nwhen the heuristic estimates are suboptimal.",

          "description": "Most image super-resolution (SR) methods are developed on synthetic\nlow-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image pairs that are constructed\nby a predetermined operation, e.g., bicubic downsampling. As existing methods\ntypically learn an inverse mapping of the specific function, they produce\nblurry results when applied to real-world images whose exact formulation is\ndifferent and unknown. Therefore, several methods attempt to synthesize much\nmore diverse LR samples or learn a realistic downsampling model. However, due\nto restrictive assumptions on the downsampling process, they are still biased\nand less generalizable. This study proposes a novel method to simulate an\nunknown downsampling process without imposing restrictive prior knowledge. We\npropose a generalizable low-frequency loss (LFL) in the adversarial training\nframework to imitate the distribution of target LR images without using any\npaired examples. Furthermore, we design an adaptive data loss (ADL) for the\ndownsampler, which can be adaptively learned and updated from the data during\nthe training loops. Extensive experiments validate that our downsampling model\ncan facilitate existing SR methods to perform more accurate reconstructions on\nvarious synthetic and real-world examples than the conventional approaches.",

More precisely, we advocate for alternative learning a more powerful\nenergy-based model with maximum likelihood estimation to obtain the deep\nenergy-based information, represented as image prior. Simultaneously, implicit\ninference with Langevin dynamics is a unique property of re-construction. In\ncontrast to other generative models for reconstruction, the proposed method\nutilizes deep energy-based information as the image prior in reconstruction to\nimprove the quality of image.\n\nResults: Experiment results that imply the proposed technique can obtain\nremarkable performance in terms of high reconstruction accuracy that is\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art methods, and does not suffer from mode\ncollapse.\n\nConclusion: Algorithmically, an iterative approach was presented to\nstrengthen EBM training with the gradient of energy network.

In this study, we propose a novel\ngenerative framework that can learn powerful representations for such tiles by\nlearning to plausibly expand their visual field. In particular, we developed a\nprogressively grown generative model with the objective of visual field\nexpansion. Thus trained, our model learns to generate different tissue types\nwith fine details, while simultaneously learning powerful representations that\ncan be used for different clinical endpoints, all in a self-supervised way. To\nevaluate the performance of our model, we conducted classification experiments\non CAMELYON17 and CRC benchmark datasets, comparing favorably to other\nself-supervised and pre-trained strategies that are commonly used in digital\npathology.

          "description": "Efficient spatiotemporal modeling is an important yet challenging problem for\nvideo action recognition. Existing state-of-the-art methods exploit motion\nclues to assist in short-term temporal modeling through temporal difference\nover consecutive frames. However, insignificant noises will be inevitably\nintroduced due to the camera movement. Besides, movements of different actions\ncan vary greatly. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Saliency Integration\n(TSI) block, which mainly contains a Salient Motion Excitation (SME) module and\na Cross-scale Temporal Integration (CTI) module. Specifically, SME aims to\nhighlight the motion-sensitive area through local-global motion modeling, where\nthe saliency alignment and pyramidal feature difference are conducted\nsuccessively between neighboring frames to capture motion dynamics with less\nnoises caused by misaligned background. CTI is designed to perform multi-scale\ntemporal modeling through a group of separate 1D convolutions respectively.\nMeanwhile, temporal interactions across different scales are integrated with\nattention mechanism. Through these two modules, long short-term temporal\nrelationships can be encoded efficiently by introducing limited additional\nparameters. Extensive experiments are conducted on several popular benchmarks\n(i.e., Something-Something V1 & V2, Kinetics-400, UCF-101, and HMDB-51), which\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.",

          "description": "The central idea of contrastive learning is to discriminate between different\ninstances and force different views of the same instance to share the same\nrepresentation. To avoid trivial solutions, augmentation plays an important\nrole in generating different views, among which random cropping is shown to be\neffective for the model to learn a strong and generalized representation.\nCommonly used random crop operation keeps the difference between two views\nstatistically consistent along the training process. In this work, we challenge\nthis convention by showing that adaptively controlling the disparity between\ntwo augmented views along the training process enhances the quality of the\nlearnt representation. Specifically, we present a parametric cubic cropping\noperation, ParamCrop, for video contrastive learning, which automatically crops\na 3D cubic from the video by differentiable 3D affine transformations.\nParamCrop is trained simultaneously with the video backbone using an\nadversarial objective and learns an optimal cropping strategy from the data.\nThe visualizations show that the center distance and the IoU between two\naugmented views are adaptively controlled by ParamCrop and the learned change\nin the disparity along the training process is beneficial to learning a strong\nrepresentation. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed ParamCrop on multiple contrastive learning frameworks and video\nbackbones.

To bridge the gap, we\npresent a new online continual object detection benchmark with an egocentric\nvideo dataset, Objects Around Krishna (OAK). OAK adopts the KrishnaCAM videos,\nan ego-centric video stream collected over nine months by a graduate student.\nOAK provides exhaustive bounding box annotations of 80 video snippets (~17.5\nhours) for 105 object categories in outdoor scenes. The emergence of new object\ncategories in our benchmark follows a pattern similar to what a single person\nmight see in their day-to-day life. The dataset also captures the natural\ndistribution shifts as the person travels to different places. These egocentric\nlong-running videos provide a realistic playground for continual learning\nalgorithms, especially in online embodied settings. We also introduce new\nevaluation metrics to evaluate the model performance and catastrophic\nforgetting and provide baseline studies for online continual object detection.\nWe believe this benchmark will pose new exciting challenges for learning from\nnon-stationary data in continual learning.

          "description": "Conventional RGB-D salient object detection methods aim to leverage depth as\ncomplementary information to find the salient regions in both modalities.\nHowever, the salient object detection results heavily rely on the quality of\ncaptured depth data which sometimes are unavailable. In this work, we make the\nfirst attempt to solve the RGB-D salient object detection problem with a novel\ndepth-awareness framework. This framework only relies on RGB data in the\ntesting phase, utilizing captured depth data as supervision for representation\nlearning. To construct our framework as well as achieving accurate salient\ndetection results, we propose a Ubiquitous Target Awareness (UTA) network to\nsolve three important challenges in RGB-D SOD task: 1) a depth awareness module\nto excavate depth information and to mine ambiguous regions via adaptive\ndepth-error weights, 2) a spatial-aware cross-modal interaction and a\nchannel-aware cross-level interaction, exploiting the low-level boundary cues\nand amplifying high-level salient channels, and 3) a gated multi-scale\npredictor module to perceive the object saliency in different contextual\nscales. Besides its high performance, our proposed UTA network is depth-free\nfor inference and runs in real-time with 43 FPS. Experimental evidence\ndemonstrates that our proposed network not only surpasses the state-of-the-art\nmethods on five public RGB-D SOD benchmarks by a large margin, but also\nverifies its extensibility on five public RGB SOD benchmarks.",

Machine learning models can derive multi-variate brain\nchange patterns related to the two processes, including the SPARE-AD (Spatial\nPatterns of Atrophy for Recognition of Alzheimer's Disease) and SPARE-BA (of\nBrain Aging) investigated herein. However, substantial overlap between brain\nregions affected in the two processes confounds measuring them independently.\nWe present a methodology toward disentangling the two. T1-weighted MRI images\nof 4,054 participants (48-95 years) with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI),\nor cognitively normal (CN) diagnoses from the iSTAGING (Imaging-based\ncoordinate SysTem for AGIng and NeurodeGenerative diseases) consortium were\nanalyzed. First, a subset of AD patients and CN adults were selected based\npurely on clinical diagnoses to train SPARE-BA1 (regression of age using CN\nindividuals) and SPARE-AD1 (classification of CN versus AD). Second, analogous\ngroups were selected based on clinical and molecular markers to train SPARE-BA2\nand SPARE-AD2: amyloid-positive (A+) AD continuum group (consisting of A+AD,\nA+MCI, and A+ and tau-positive CN individuals) and amyloid-negative (A-) CN\ngroup. Finally, the combined group of the AD continuum and A-/CN individuals\nwas used to train SPARE-BA3, with the intention to estimate brain age\nregardless of AD-related brain changes. Disentangled SPARE models derived brain\npatterns that were more specific to the two types of the brain changes.\nCorrelation between the SPARE-BA and SPARE-AD was significantly reduced.\nCorrelation of disentangled SPARE-AD was non-inferior to the molecular\nmeasurements and to the number of APOE4 alleles, but was less to AD-related\npsychometric test scores, suggesting contribution of advanced brain aging to\nthese scores.",

          "description": "Online action detection, which aims to identify an ongoing action from a\nstreaming video, is an important subject in real-world applications. For this\ntask, previous methods use recurrent neural networks for modeling temporal\nrelations in an input sequence. However, these methods overlook the fact that\nthe input image sequence includes not only the action of interest but\nbackground and irrelevant actions. This would induce recurrent units to\naccumulate unnecessary information for encoding features on the action of\ninterest. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel recurrent unit, named\nInformation Discrimination Unit (IDU), which explicitly discriminates the\ninformation relevancy between an ongoing action and others to decide whether to\naccumulate the input information. This enables learning more discriminative\nrepresentations for identifying an ongoing action. In this paper, we further\npresent a new recurrent unit, called Information Integration Unit (IIU), for\naction anticipation. Our IIU exploits the outputs from IDU as pseudo action\nlabels as well as RGB frames to learn enriched features of observed actions\neffectively. In experiments on TVSeries and THUMOS-14, the proposed methods\noutperform state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in online action\ndetection and action anticipation.

In this paper, we further\ninvestigate this problem and extend the above conclusion: only early\nconvolutions do not help for stable training, but the scaled ReLU operation in\nthe \\textit{convolutional stem} (\\textit{conv-stem}) matters. We verify, both\ntheoretically and empirically, that scaled ReLU in \\textit{conv-stem} not only\nimproves training stabilization, but also increases the diversity of patch\ntokens, thus boosting peak performance with a large margin via adding few\nparameters and flops. In addition, extensive experiments are conducted to\ndemonstrate that previous ViTs are far from being well trained, further showing\nthat ViTs have great potential to be a better substitute of CNNs.",

Therefore, it is a natural choice to\naggregate temporal information from other frames of the same video into the\ncurrent frame. However, RoI Align, as one of the most core procedures of video\ndetectors, still remains extracting features from a single-frame feature map\nfor proposals, making the extracted RoI features lack temporal information from\nvideos. In this work, considering the features of the same object instance are\nhighly similar among frames in a video, a novel Temporal RoI Align operator is\nproposed to extract features from other frames feature maps for current frame\nproposals by utilizing feature similarity. The proposed Temporal RoI Align\noperator can extract temporal information from the entire video for proposals.\nWe integrate it into single-frame video detectors and other state-of-the-art\nvideo detectors, and conduct quantitative experiments to demonstrate that the\nproposed Temporal RoI Align operator can consistently and significantly boost\nthe performance.

          "description": "Projecting the point cloud on the 2D spherical range image transforms the\nLiDAR semantic segmentation to a 2D segmentation task on the range image.\nHowever, the LiDAR range image is still naturally different from the regular 2D\nRGB image; for example, each position on the range image encodes the unique\ngeometry information. In this paper, we propose a new projection-based LiDAR\nsemantic segmentation pipeline that consists of a novel network structure and\nan efficient post-processing step. In our network structure, we design a FID\n(fully interpolation decoding) module that directly upsamples the\nmulti-resolution feature maps using bilinear interpolation. Inspired by the 3D\ndistance interpolation used in PointNet++, we argue this FID module is a 2D\nversion distance interpolation on $(\\theta, \\phi)$ space. As a parameter-free\ndecoding module, the FID largely reduces the model complexity by maintaining\ngood performance. Besides the network structure, we empirically find that our\nmodel predictions have clear boundaries between different semantic classes.\nThis makes us rethink whether the widely used K-nearest-neighbor\npost-processing is still necessary for our pipeline. Then, we realize the\nmany-to-one mapping causes the blurring effect that some points are mapped into\nthe same pixel and share the same label. Therefore, we propose to process those\noccluded points by assigning the nearest predicted label to them. This NLA\n(nearest label assignment) post-processing step shows a better performance than\nKNN with faster inference speed in the ablation study. On the SemanticKITTI\ndataset, our pipeline achieves the best performance among all projection-based\nmethods with $64 \\times 2048$ resolution and all point-wise solutions. With a\nResNet-34 as the backbone, both the training and testing of our model can be\nfinished on a single RTX 2080 Ti with 11G memory. The code is released.",

          "description": "The problem of generalizing deep neural networks from multiple source domains\nto a target one is studied under two settings: When unlabeled target data is\navailable, it is a multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) problem,\notherwise a domain generalization (DG) problem. We propose a unified framework\ntermed domain adaptive ensemble learning (DAEL) to address both problems. A\nDAEL model is composed of a CNN feature extractor shared across domains and\nmultiple classifier heads each trained to specialize in a particular source\ndomain. Each such classifier is an expert to its own domain and a non-expert to\nothers. DAEL aims to learn these experts collaboratively so that when forming\nan ensemble, they can leverage complementary information from each other to be\nmore effective for an unseen target domain.

The experiments\nwere performed on diverse anatomies(eye, liver, pancreas and breast) from\npublicly available datasets to show applicability of the proposed metric across\ndifferent imaging techniques. Mean opinion score (MOS) and statistical\nsignificance testing is used to quantify the relevance of proposed approach.\nAcross 33 fundus images, where the largest exudate is 1.41%, and the smallest\nis 0.0002% of the image, the proposed metric is 30% closer to MOS, as compared\nto Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Statistical significance testing resulted\nin promising p-value of order 10^{-18} with SSEGEP for hepatic tumor compared\nto DSC. The proposed metric is found to perform better for the images having\nmultiple segments for a single label.",

Large\neddy simulation (LES) is an alternative that is computationally less demanding,\nbut is unable to capture all of the scales of turbulent transport accurately.\nOur goal in this work is to build a new data-driven methodology based on\nsuper-resolution techniques to reconstruct DNS data from LES predictions. We\nleverage the underlying physical relationships to regularize the relationships\namongst different physical variables. We also introduce a hierarchical\ngenerative process and a reverse degradation process to fully explore the\ncorrespondence between DNS and LES data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour method through a single-snapshot experiment and a cross-time experiment.\nThe results confirm that our method can better reconstruct high-resolution DNS\ndata over space and over time in terms of pixel-wise reconstruction error and\nstructural similarity.

          "description": "Localizing stereo boundaries and predicting nearby disparities are difficult\nbecause stereo boundaries induce occluded regions where matching cues are\nabsent. Most modern computer vision algorithms treat occlusions secondarily\n(e.g., via left-right consistency checks after matching) or rely on high-level\ncues to improve nearby disparities (e.g., via deep networks and large training\nsets). They ignore the geometry of stereo occlusions, which dictates that the\nspatial extent of occlusion must equal the amplitude of the disparity jump that\ncauses it. This paper introduces an energy and level-set optimizer that\nimproves boundaries by encoding occlusion geometry. Our model applies to\ntwo-layer, figure-ground scenes, and it can be implemented cooperatively using\nmessages that pass predominantly between parents and children in an undecimated\nhierarchy of multi-scale image patches. In a small collection of figure-ground\nscenes curated from Middlebury and Falling Things stereo datasets, our model\nprovides more accurate boundaries than previous occlusion-handling stereo\ntechniques.

          "description": "Over the last decade, one of the most relevant public datasets for evaluating\nodometry accuracy is the KITTI dataset. Beside the quality and rich sensor\nsetup, its success is also due to the online evaluation tool, which enables\nresearchers to benchmark and compare algorithms. The results are evaluated on\nthe test subset solely, without any knowledge about the ground truth, yielding\nunbiased, overfit free and therefore relevant validation for robot localization\nbased on cameras, 3D laser or combination of both. However, as any sensor\nsetup, it requires prior calibration and rectified stereo images are provided,\nintroducing dependence on the default calibration parameters. Given that, a\nnatural question arises if a better set of calibration parameters can be found\nthat would yield higher odometry accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new\napproach for one shot calibration of the KITTI dataset multiple camera setup.\nThe approach yields better calibration parameters, both in the sense of lower\ncalibration reprojection errors and lower visual odometry error. We conducted\nexperiments where we show for three different odometry algorithms, namely\nSOFT2, ORB-SLAM2 and VISO2, that odometry accuracy is significantly improved\nwith the proposed calibration parameters. Moreover, our odometry, SOFT2, in\nconjunction with the proposed calibration method achieved the highest accuracy\non the official KITTI scoreboard with 0.53% translational and 0.0009 deg/m\nrotational error, outperforming even 3D laser-based methods.",

It\nis a common belief that a key step towards solving this task resides in\nmodelling accurately both spatial and temporal information in video signals. A\npromising direction to do so has been to learn latent variable models that\npredict the future in latent space and project back to pixels, as suggested in\nrecent literature. Following this line of work and building on top of a family\nof models introduced in prior work, Neural ODE, we investigate an approach that\nmodels time-continuous dynamics over a continuous latent space with a\ndifferential equation with respect to time. The intuition behind this approach\nis that these trajectories in latent space could then be extrapolated to\ngenerate video frames beyond the time steps for which the model is trained.

          "description": "Emotion recognition (ER) from facial images is one of the landmark tasks in\naffective computing with major developments in the last decade. Initial efforts\non ER relied on handcrafted features that were used to characterize facial\nimages and then feed to standard predictive models. Recent methodologies\ncomprise end-to-end trainable deep learning methods that simultaneously learn\nboth, features and predictive model. Perhaps the most successful models are\nbased on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While these models have excelled\nat this task, they still fail at capturing local patterns that could emerge in\nthe learning process. We hypothesize these patterns could be captured by\nvariants based on locally weighted learning. Specifically, in this paper we\npropose a CNN based architecture enhanced with multiple branches formed by\nradial basis function (RBF) units that aims at exploiting local information at\nthe final stage of the learning process. Intuitively, these RBF units capture\nlocal patterns shared by similar instances using an intermediate\nrepresentation, then the outputs of the RBFs are feed to a softmax layer that\nexploits this information to improve the predictive performance of the model.\nThis feature could be particularly advantageous in ER as cultural / ethnicity\ndifferences may be identified by the local units. We evaluate the proposed\nmethod in several ER datasets and show the proposed methodology achieves\nstate-of-the-art in some of them, even when we adopt a pre-trained VGG-Face\nmodel as backbone. We show it is the incorporation of local information what\nmakes the proposed model competitive.",

          "description": "Quantization has been proven to be a vital method for improving the inference\nefficiency of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it is still challenging to\nstrike a good balance between accuracy and efficiency while quantizing DNN\nweights or activation values from high-precision formats to their quantized\ncounterparts. We propose a new method called elastic significant bit\nquantization (ESB) that controls the number of significant bits of quantized\nvalues to obtain better inference accuracy with fewer resources. We design a\nunified mathematical formula to constrain the quantized values of the ESB with\na flexible number of significant bits. We also introduce a distribution\ndifference aligner (DDA) to quantitatively align the distributions between the\nfull-precision weight or activation values and quantized values. Consequently,\nESB is suitable for various bell-shaped distributions of weights and activation\nof DNNs, thus maintaining a high inference accuracy. Benefitting from fewer\nsignificant bits of quantized values, ESB can reduce the multiplication\ncomplexity. We implement ESB as an accelerator and quantitatively evaluate its\nefficiency on FPGAs. Extensive experimental results illustrate that ESB\nquantization consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves\naverage accuracy improvements of 4.78%, 1.92%, and 3.56% over AlexNet,\nResNet18, and MobileNetV2, respectively. Furthermore, ESB as an accelerator can\nachieve 10.95 GOPS peak performance of 1k LUTs without DSPs on the Xilinx\nZCU102 FPGA platform. Compared with CPU, GPU, and state-of-the-art accelerators\non FPGAs, the ESB accelerator can improve the energy efficiency by up to 65x,\n11x, and 26x, respectively.",

So, it is very\ntranquil to have robots which can follow a specific human by following the\nunique coloured object held by that person. So, we propose a robotic system\nwhich uses robot vision and deep learning to get the required linear and\nangular velocities which are {\\nu} and {\\omega}, respectively. Which in turn\nmakes the robot to avoid obstacles when following the unique coloured object\nheld by the human. The novel methodology that we are proposing is accurate in\ndetecting the position of the unique coloured object in any kind of lighting\nand tells us the horizontal pixel value where the robot is present and also\ntells if the object is close to or far from the robot. Moreover, the artificial\nneural networks that we have used in this problem gave us a meagre error in\nlinear and angular velocity prediction and the PI controller which was used to\ncontrol the linear and angular velocities, which in turn controls the position\nof the robot gave us impressive results and this methodology outperforms all\nother methodologies.",

          "description": "Inferring programs which generate 2D and 3D shapes is important for reverse\nengineering, editing, and more. Training such inference models is challenging\ndue to the lack of paired (shape, program) data in most domains. A popular\napproach is to pre-train a model on synthetic data and then fine-tune on real\nshapes using slow, unstable reinforcement learning. In this paper, we argue\nthat self-training is a viable alternative for fine-tuning such models.\nSelf-training is a semi-supervised learning paradigm where a model assigns\npseudo-labels to unlabeled data, and then retrains with (data, pseudo-label)\npairs as the new ground truth. We show that for constructive solid geometry and\nassembly-based modeling, self-training outperforms state-of-the-art\nreinforcement learning approaches. Additionally, shape program inference has a\nunique property that circumvents a potential downside of self-training\n(incorrect pseudo-label assignment): inferred programs are executable. For a\ngiven shape from our distribution of interest $\\mathbf{x}^*$ and its predicted\nprogram $\\mathbf{z}$, one can execute $\\mathbf{z}$ to obtain a shape\n$\\mathbf{x}$ and train on $(\\mathbf{z}, \\mathbf{x})$ pairs, rather than\n$(\\mathbf{z}, \\mathbf{x}^*)$ pairs. We term this procedure latent execution\nself training (LEST). We demonstrate that self training infers shape programs\nwith higher shape reconstruction accuracy and converges significantly faster\nthan reinforcement learning approaches, and in some domains, LEST can further\nimprove this performance.",

          "description": "Domain adaptation aims to leverage information from the source domain to\nimprove the classification performance in the target domain. It mainly utilizes\ntwo schemes: sample reweighting and feature matching. While the first scheme\nallocates different weights to individual samples, the second scheme matches\nthe feature of two domains using global structural statistics. The two schemes\nare complementary with each other, which are expected to jointly work for\nrobust domain adaptation. Several methods combine the two schemes, but the\nunderlying relationship of samples is insufficiently analyzed due to the\nneglect of the hierarchy of samples and the geometric properties between\nsamples. To better combine the advantages of the two schemes, we propose a\nGrassmannian graph-attentional landmark selection (GGLS) framework for domain\nadaptation. GGLS presents a landmark selection scheme using attention-induced\nneighbors of the graphical structure of samples and performs distribution\nadaptation and knowledge adaptation over Grassmann manifold. the former treats\nthe landmarks of each sample differently, and the latter avoids feature\ndistortion and achieves better geometric properties.

          "description": "Aerial scene recognition is a fundamental research problem in interpreting\nhigh-resolution aerial imagery. Over the past few years, most studies focus on\nclassifying an image into one scene category, while in real-world scenarios, it\nis more often that a single image contains multiple scenes. Therefore, in this\npaper, we investigate a more practical yet underexplored task -- multi-scene\nrecognition in single images. To this end, we create a large-scale dataset,\ncalled MultiScene, composed of 100,000 unconstrained high-resolution aerial\nimages. Considering that manually labeling such images is extremely arduous, we\nresort to low-cost annotations from crowdsourcing platforms, e.g.,\nOpenStreetMap (OSM). However, OSM data might suffer from incompleteness and\nincorrectness, which introduce noise into image labels. To address this issue,\nwe visually inspect 14,000 images and correct their scene labels, yielding a\nsubset of cleanly-annotated images, named MultiScene-Clean. With it, we can\ndevelop and evaluate deep networks for multi-scene recognition using clean\ndata. Moreover, we provide crowdsourced annotations of all images for the\npurpose of studying network learning with noisy labels. We conduct experiments\nwith extensive baseline models on both MultiScene-Clean and MultiScene to offer\nbenchmarks for multi-scene recognition in single images and learning from noisy\nlabels for this task, respectively. To facilitate progress, we make our dataset\nand trained models available on\nhttps://gitlab.lrz.de/ai4eo/reasoning/multiscene.",

Unlike\nexisted single-factor digital perturbation work, we provide state-of-the-art\ntwo-factor perturbation that provides two natural perturbations on images\napplied in different sequences. The two-factor perturbation includes (1) two\ndigital perturbations (Salt & pepper noise and Gaussian noise) applied in both\nsequences. (2) one digital perturbation (salt & pepper noise) and a geometric\nperturbation (rotation) applied in different sequences. To measure robust DL\nclassifiers, previous scientists provided 15 types of single-factor corruption.\nWe created 69 benchmarking image sets, including a clean set, sets with single\nfactor perturbations, and sets with two-factor perturbation conditions. To be\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first report that two-factor perturbed\nimages improves both robustness and accuracy of DL classifiers. Previous\nresearch evaluating deep learning (DL) classifiers has often used top-1/top-5\naccuracy, so researchers have usually offered tables, line diagrams, and bar\ncharts to display accuracy of DL classifiers.

When available, depth images provide\nhelpful geometric cues that complement the RGB texture information and help to\nidentify discriminative scene image features. Depth sensing technology\ndeveloped fast in the last years and a great variety of 3D cameras have been\nintroduced, each with different acquisition properties. However, those\nproperties are often neglected when targeting big data collections, so\nmulti-modal images are gathered disregarding their original nature. In this\nwork, we put under the spotlight the existence of a possibly severe domain\nshift issue within multi-modality scene recognition datasets. As a consequence,\na scene classification model trained on one camera may not generalize on data\nfrom a different camera, only providing a low recognition performance. Starting\nfrom the well-known SUN RGB-D dataset, we designed an experimental testbed to\nstudy this problem and we use it to benchmark the performance of existing\nmethods. Finally, we introduce a novel adaptive scene recognition approach that\nleverages self-supervised translation between modalities.

To achieve better performance with fewer\ntrainable parameters, recent methods are proposed to go shallower by parameter\nsharing or model compressing along with the depth. However, weak modeling\ncapacity limits their performance. Contrastively, going wider by inducing more\ntrainable matrixes and parameters would produce a huge model requiring advanced\nparallelism to train and inference.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a parameter-efficient framework, going wider\ninstead of deeper. Specially, following existing works, we adapt parameter\nsharing to compress along depth. But, such deployment would limit the\nperformance. To maximize modeling capacity, we scale along model width by\nreplacing feed-forward network (FFN) with mixture-of-experts (MoE). Across\ntransformer blocks, instead of sharing normalization layers, we propose to use\nindividual layernorms to transform various semantic representations in a more\nparameter-efficient way.

          "description": "As moving objects always draw more attention of human eyes, the temporal\nmotive information is always exploited complementarily with spatial information\nto detect salient objects in videos. Although efficient tools such as optical\nflow have been proposed to extract temporal motive information, it often\nencounters difficulties when used for saliency detection due to the movement of\ncamera or the partial movement of salient objects. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the complimentary roles of spatial and temporal information and\npropose a novel dynamic spatiotemporal network (DS-Net) for more effective\nfusion of spatiotemporal information. We construct a symmetric two-bypass\nnetwork to explicitly extract spatial and temporal features. A dynamic weight\ngenerator (DWG) is designed to automatically learn the reliability of\ncorresponding saliency branch. And a top-down cross attentive aggregation (CAA)\nprocedure is designed so as to facilitate dynamic complementary aggregation of\nspatiotemporal features. Finally, the features are modified by spatial\nattention with the guidance of coarse saliency map and then go through decoder\npart for final saliency map. Experimental results on five benchmarks VOS,\nDAVIS, FBMS, SegTrack-v2, and ViSal demonstrate that the proposed method\nachieves superior performance than state-of-the-art algorithms.

          "description": "3D action recognition is referred to as the classification of action\nsequences which consist of 3D skeleton joints. While many research work are\ndevoted to 3D action recognition, it mainly suffers from three problems: highly\ncomplicated articulation, a great amount of noise, and a low implementation\nefficiency. To tackle all these problems, we propose a real-time 3D action\nrecognition framework by integrating the locally aggregated kinematic-guided\nskeletonlet (LAKS) with a supervised hashing-by-analysis (SHA) model. We first\ndefine the skeletonlet as a few combinations of joint offsets grouped in terms\nof kinematic principle, and then represent an action sequence using LAKS, which\nconsists of a denoising phase and a locally aggregating phase. The denoising\nphase detects the noisy action data and adjust it by replacing all the features\nwithin it with the features of the corresponding previous frame, while the\nlocally aggregating phase sums the difference between an offset feature of the\nskeletonlet and its cluster center together over all the offset features of the\nsequence. Finally, the SHA model which combines sparse representation with a\nhashing model, aiming at promoting the recognition accuracy while maintaining a\nhigh efficiency. Experimental results on MSRAction3D, UTKinectAction3D and\nFlorence3DAction datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in both recognition accuracy and implementation\nefficiency.",

          "description": "Deep learning (DL) has been the primary approach used in various computer\nvision tasks due to its relevant results achieved on many tasks. However, on\nreal-world scenarios with partially or no labeled data, DL methods are also\nprone to the well-known domain shift problem. Multi-source unsupervised domain\nadaptation (MSDA) aims at learning a predictor for an unlabeled domain by\nassigning weak knowledge from a bag of source models. However, most works\nconduct domain adaptation leveraging only the extracted features and reducing\ntheir domain shift from the perspective of loss function designs. In this\npaper, we argue that it is not sufficient to handle domain shift only based on\ndomain-level features, but it is also essential to align such information on\nthe feature space. Unlike previous works, we focus on the network design and\npropose to embed Multi-Source version of DomaIn Alignment Layers (MS-DIAL) at\ndifferent levels of the predictor. These layers are designed to match the\nfeature distributions between different domains and can be easily applied to\nvarious MSDA methods. To show the robustness of our approach, we conducted an\nextensive experimental evaluation considering two challenging scenarios: digit\nrecognition and object classification. The experimental results indicated that\nour approach can improve state-of-the-art MSDA methods, yielding relative gains\nof up to +30.64% on their classification accuracies.",

          "description": "Annotated images are required for both supervised model training and\nevaluation in image classification. Manually annotating images is arduous and\nexpensive, especially for multi-labeled images. A recent trend for conducting\nsuch laboursome annotation tasks is through crowdsourcing, where images are\nannotated by volunteers or paid workers online (e.g., workers of Amazon\nMechanical Turk) from scratch. However, the quality of crowdsourcing image\nannotations cannot be guaranteed, and incompleteness and incorrectness are two\nmajor concerns for crowdsourcing annotations. To address such concerns, we have\na rethinking of crowdsourcing annotations: Our simple hypothesis is that if the\nannotators only partially annotate multi-label images with salient labels they\nare confident in, there will be fewer annotation errors and annotators will\nspend less time on uncertain labels. As a pleasant surprise, with the same\nannotation budget, we show a multi-label image classifier supervised by images\nwith salient annotations can outperform models supervised by fully annotated\nimages. Our method contributions are 2-fold: An active learning way is proposed\nto acquire salient labels for multi-label images; and a novel Adaptive\nTemperature Associated Model (ATAM) specifically using partial annotations is\nproposed for multi-label image classification. We conduct experiments on\npractical crowdsourcing data, the Open Street Map (OSM) dataset and benchmark\ndataset COCO 2014. When compared with state-of-the-art classification methods\ntrained on fully annotated images, the proposed ATAM can achieve higher\naccuracy. The proposed idea is promising for crowdsourcing data annotation. Our\ncode will be publicly available.",

Using the newly proposed evaluation procedures for two large public\nnaturalistic data sets for studying pedestrian behavior in traffic: JAAD and\nPIE, we evaluate TrouSPI-Net and analyze its performance.

When comparing with\nstate-of-the-art posit multipliers, experiments show that the proposed\ntechnique reduces the area, power, and delay of hardware multipliers up to\n72.86%, 81.79%, and 17.01%, respectively, without accuracy degradation.",

          "description": "Quantum machine learning is expected to be one of the first practical\napplications of near-term quantum devices. Pioneer theoretical works suggest\nthat quantum generative adversarial networks (GANs) may exhibit a potential\nexponential advantage over classical GANs, thus attracting widespread\nattention. However, it remains elusive whether quantum GANs implemented on\nnear-term quantum devices can actually solve real-world learning tasks. Here,\nwe devise a flexible quantum GAN scheme to narrow this knowledge gap, which\ncould accomplish image generation with arbitrarily high-dimensional features,\nand could also take advantage of quantum superposition to train multiple\nexamples in parallel. For the first time, we experimentally achieve the\nlearning and generation of real-world hand-written digit images on a\nsuperconducting quantum processor. Moreover, we utilize a gray-scale bar\ndataset to exhibit the competitive performance between quantum GANs and the\nclassical GANs based on multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural network\narchitectures, respectively, benchmarked by the Fr\\'echet Distance score. Our\nwork provides guidance for developing advanced quantum generative models on\nnear-term quantum devices and opens up an avenue for exploring quantum\nadvantages in various GAN-related learning tasks.",

First, with careful examination on existing self-supervised\nlearning approaches, we reveal the surprising result that, given suitable data\naugmentation, models trained from scratch in fact achieve comparable\nperformance to those pre-trained with self-supervised learning. Second,\ninspired by the fact that tumors tend to be characterized independently to the\ncontexts, we propose a scalable pipeline for generating synthetic tumor data,\nand train a self-supervised model that minimises the generalisation gap with\nthe downstream task. Third, we conduct extensive ablation studies on different\ndownstream datasets, BraTS2018 for brain tumor segmentation and LiTS2017 for\nliver tumor segmentation. While evaluating the model transferability for tumor\nsegmentation under a low-annotation regime, including an extreme case of\nzero-shot segmentation, the proposed approach demonstrates state-of-the-art\nperformance, substantially outperforming all existing self-supervised\napproaches, and opening up the usage of self-supervised learning in practical\nscenarios.",

          "description": "Traffic management systems capture tremendous video data and leverage\nadvances in video processing to detect and monitor traffic incidents. The\ncollected data are traditionally forwarded to the traffic management center\n(TMC) for in-depth analysis and may thus exacerbate the network paths to the\nTMC. To alleviate such bottlenecks, we propose to utilize edge computing by\nequipping edge nodes that are close to cameras with computing resources (e.g.\ncloudlets). A cloudlet, with limited computing resources as compared to TMC,\nprovides limited video processing capabilities. In this paper, we focus on two\ncommon traffic monitoring tasks, congestion detection, and speed detection, and\npropose a two-tier edge computing based model that takes into account of both\nthe limited computing capability in cloudlets and the unstable network\ncondition to the TMC. Our solution utilizes two algorithms for each task, one\nimplemented at the edge and the other one at the TMC, which are designed with\nthe consideration of different computing resources. While the TMC provides\nstrong computation power, the video quality it receives depends on the\nunderlying network conditions. On the other hand, the edge processes very\nhigh-quality video but with limited computing resources. Our model captures\nthis trade-off. We evaluate the performance of the proposed two-tier model as\nwell as the traffic monitoring algorithms via test-bed experiments under\ndifferent weather as well as network conditions and show that our proposed\nhybrid edge-cloud solution outperforms both the cloud-only and edge-only\nsolutions.",

          "description": "3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely adopted for airway\nsegmentation. The performance of 3D CNNs is greatly influenced by the dataset\nwhile the public airway datasets are mainly clean CT scans with coarse\nannotation, thus difficult to be generalized to noisy CT scans (e.g. COVID-19\nCT scans). In this work, we proposed a new dual-stream network to address the\nvariability between the clean domain and noisy domain, which utilizes the clean\nCT scans and a small amount of labeled noisy CT scans for airway segmentation.\nWe designed two different encoders to extract the transferable clean features\nand the unique noisy features separately, followed by two independent decoders.\nFurther on, the transferable features are refined by the channel-wise feature\nrecalibration and Signed Distance Map (SDM) regression. The feature\nrecalibration module emphasizes critical features and the SDM pays more\nattention to the bronchi, which is beneficial to extracting the transferable\ntopological features robust to the coarse labels. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrated the obvious improvement brought by our proposed method.\nCompared to other state-of-the-art transfer learning methods, our method\naccurately segmented more bronchi in the noisy CT scans.",

          "description": "Prediction of Overall Survival (OS) of brain cancer patients from multi-modal\nMRI is a challenging field of research. Most of the existing literature on\nsurvival prediction is based on Radiomic features, which does not consider\neither non-biological factors or the functional neurological status of the\npatient(s). Besides, the selection of an appropriate cut-off for survival and\nthe presence of censored data create further problems. Application of deep\nlearning models for OS prediction is also limited due to the lack of large\nannotated publicly available datasets. In this scenario we analyse the\npotential of two novel neuroimaging feature families, extracted from brain\nparcellation atlases and spatial habitats, along with classical radiomic and\ngeometric features; to study their combined predictive power for analysing\noverall survival. A cross validation strategy with grid search is proposed to\nsimultaneously select and evaluate the most predictive feature subset based on\nits predictive power. A Cox Proportional Hazard (CoxPH) model is employed for\nunivariate feature selection, followed by the prediction of patient-specific\nsurvival functions by three multivariate parsimonious models viz. Coxnet,\nRandom survival forests (RSF) and Survival SVM (SSVM). The brain cancer MRI\ndata used for this research was taken from two open-access collections TCGA-GBM\nand TCGA-LGG available from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Corresponding\nsurvival data for each patient was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas\n(TCGA). A high cross validation $C-index$ score of $0.82\\pm.10$ was achieved\nusing RSF with the best $24$ selected features. Age was found to be the most\nimportant biological predictor. There were $9$, $6$, $6$ and $2$ features\nselected from the parcellation, habitat, radiomic and region-based feature\ngroups respectively.",

          "description": "Kinship verification is a long-standing research challenge in computer\nvision. The visual differences presented to the face have a significant effect\non the recognition capabilities of the kinship systems. We argue that\naggregating multiple visual knowledge can better describe the characteristics\nof the subject for precise kinship identification. Typically, the age-invariant\nfeatures can represent more natural facial details. Such age-related\ntransformations are essential for face recognition due to the biological\neffects of aging. However, the existing methods mainly focus on employing the\nsingle-view image features for kinship identification, while more meaningful\nvisual properties such as race and age are directly ignored in the feature\nlearning step. To this end, we propose a novel deep collaborative multi-modal\nlearning (DCML) to integrate the underlying information presented in facial\nproperties in an adaptive manner to strengthen the facial details for effective\nunsupervised kinship verification. Specifically, we construct a well-designed\nadaptive feature fusion mechanism, which can jointly leverage the complementary\nproperties from different visual perspectives to produce composite features and\ndraw greater attention to the most informative components of spatial feature\nmaps. Particularly, an adaptive weighting strategy is developed based on a\nnovel attention mechanism, which can enhance the dependencies between different\nproperties by decreasing the information redundancy in channels in a\nself-adaptive manner. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method,\nextensive experimental evaluations conducted on four widely-used datasets show\nthat our DCML method is always superior to some state-of-the-art kinship\nverification methods.",

Existing works on backdoor attacks and defenses, however,\nmostly focus on digital attacks that use digitally generated patterns as\ntriggers. A critical question remains unanswered: can backdoor attacks succeed\nusing physical objects as triggers, thus making them a credible threat against\ndeep learning systems in the real world? We conduct a detailed empirical study\nto explore this question for facial recognition, a critical deep learning task.\nUsing seven physical objects as triggers, we collect a custom dataset of 3205\nimages of ten volunteers and use it to study the feasibility of physical\nbackdoor attacks under a variety of real-world conditions. Our study reveals\ntwo key findings. First, physical backdoor attacks can be highly successful if\nthey are carefully configured to overcome the constraints imposed by physical\nobjects. In particular, the placement of successful triggers is largely\nconstrained by the target model's dependence on key facial features. Second,\nfour of today's state-of-the-art defenses against (digital) backdoors are\nineffective against physical backdoors, because the use of physical objects\nbreaks core assumptions used to construct these defenses. Our study confirms\nthat (physical) backdoor attacks are not a hypothetical phenomenon but rather\npose a serious real-world threat to critical classification tasks.

          "description": "This paper contributes a new high-quality dataset for hand gesture\nrecognition in hand hygiene systems, named \"MFH\". Generally, current datasets\nare not focused on: (i) fine-grained actions; and (ii) data mismatch between\ndifferent viewpoints, which are available under realistic settings. To address\nthe aforementioned issues, the MFH dataset is proposed to contain a total of\n731147 samples obtained by different camera views in 6 non-overlapping\nlocations. Additionally, each sample belongs to one of seven steps introduced\nby the World Health Organization (WHO). As a minor contribution, inspired by\nadvances in fine-grained image recognition and distribution adaptation, this\npaper recommends using the self-supervised learning method to handle these\npreceding problems. The extensive experiments on the benchmarking MFH dataset\nshow that the introduced method yields competitive performance in both the\nAccuracy and the Macro F1-score. The code and the MFH dataset are available at\nhttps://github.com/willogy-team/hand-gesture-recognition-smc2021.",

          "description": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective framework that aims to transfer\nmeaningful information from a large teacher to a smaller student. Generally, KD\noften involves how to define and transfer knowledge. Previous KD methods often\nfocus on mining various forms of knowledge, for example, feature maps and\nrefined information. However, the knowledge is derived from the primary\nsupervised task and thus is highly task-specific. Motivated by the recent\nsuccess of self-supervised representation learning, we propose an auxiliary\nself-supervision augmented task to guide networks to learn more meaningful\nfeatures. Therefore, we can derive soft self-supervision augmented\ndistributions as richer dark knowledge from this task for KD. Unlike previous\nknowledge, this distribution encodes joint knowledge from supervised and\nself-supervised feature learning. Beyond knowledge exploration, another crucial\naspect is how to learn and distill our proposed knowledge effectively. To fully\ntake advantage of hierarchical feature maps, we propose to append several\nauxiliary branches at various hidden layers. Each auxiliary branch is guided to\nlearn self-supervision augmented task and distill this distribution from\nteacher to student. Thus we call our KD method as Hierarchical Self-Supervision\nAugmented Knowledge Distillation (HSSAKD). Experiments on standard image\nclassification show that both offline and online HSSAKD achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in the field of KD. Further transfer experiments\non object detection further verify that HSSAKD can guide the network to learn\nbetter features, which can be attributed to learn and distill an auxiliary\nself-supervision augmented task effectively.",

Our proposed\nprogressive self-guided loss simulates a morphological closing operation on the\nmodel predictions for progressively creating auxiliary training supervisions to\nstep-wisely guide the training process. We demonstrate that this new loss\nfunction can guide the SOD model to highlight more complete salient objects\nstep-by-step and meanwhile help to uncover the spatial dependencies of the\nsalient object pixels in a region growing manner. Moreover, a new feature\naggregation module is proposed to capture multi-scale features and aggregate\nthem adaptively by a branch-wise attention mechanism.

To this end, there has\nbeen a growing surge of interest to learn simultaneously from multiple training\ndomains - while enforcing different types of invariance across those domains.\nYet, all existing approaches fail to show systematic benefits under fair\nevaluation protocols. In this paper, we propose a new learning scheme to\nenforce domain invariance in the space of the gradients of the loss function:\nspecifically, we introduce a regularization term that matches the domain-level\nvariances of gradients across training domains. Critically, our strategy, named\nFishr, exhibits close relations with the Fisher Information and the Hessian of\nthe loss. We show that forcing domain-level gradient covariances to be similar\nduring the learning procedure eventually aligns the domain-level loss\nlandscapes locally around the final weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of Fishr for out-of-distribution generalization. In\nparticular, Fishr improves the state of the art on the DomainBed benchmark and\nperforms significantly better than Empirical Risk Minimization.

          "description": "Previous versions of sparse principal component analysis (PCA) have presumed\nthat the eigen-basis (a $p \\times k$ matrix) is approximately sparse. We\npropose a method that presumes the $p \\times k$ matrix becomes approximately\nsparse after a $k \\times k$ rotation. The simplest version of the algorithm\ninitializes with the leading $k$ principal components. Then, the principal\ncomponents are rotated with an $k \\times k$ orthogonal rotation to make them\napproximately sparse. Finally, soft-thresholding is applied to the rotated\nprincipal components. This approach differs from prior approaches because it\nuses an orthogonal rotation to approximate a sparse basis. One consequence is\nthat a sparse component need not to be a leading eigenvector, but rather a\nmixture of them. In this way, we propose a new (rotated) basis for sparse PCA.\nIn addition, our approach avoids \"deflation\" and multiple tuning parameters\nrequired for that. Our sparse PCA framework is versatile; for example, it\nextends naturally to a two-way analysis of a data matrix for simultaneous\ndimensionality reduction of rows and columns. We provide evidence showing that\nfor the same level of sparsity, the proposed sparse PCA method is more stable\nand can explain more variance compared to alternative methods. Through three\napplications -- sparse coding of images, analysis of transcriptome sequencing\ndata, and large-scale clustering of social networks, we demonstrate the modern\nusefulness of sparse PCA in exploring multivariate data.",

          "description": "This paper proposes a Perceptual Learned Video Compression (PLVC) approach\nwith recurrent conditional generative adversarial network. In our approach, the\nrecurrent auto-encoder-based generator learns to fully explore the temporal\ncorrelation for compressing video. More importantly, we propose a recurrent\nconditional discriminator, which judges raw and compressed video conditioned on\nboth spatial and temporal information, including the latent representation,\ntemporal motion and hidden states in recurrent cells. This way, in the\nadversarial training, it pushes the generated video to be not only spatially\nphoto-realistic but also temporally consistent with groundtruth and coherent\namong video frames. Therefore, the proposed PLVC model learns to compress video\ntowards good perceptual quality at low bit-rate. The experimental results show\nthat our PLVC approach outperforms the previous traditional and learned\napproaches on several perceptual quality metrics. The user study further\nvalidates the outstanding perceptual performance of PLVC in comparison with the\nlatest learned video compression approaches and the official HEVC test model\n(HM 16.20).

          "description": "There hardly exists any large-scale datasets with dense optical flow of\nnon-rigid motion from real-world imagery as of today. The reason lies mainly in\nthe required setup to derive ground truth optical flows: a series of images\nwith known camera poses along its trajectory, and an accurate 3D model from a\ntextured scene. Human annotation is not only too tedious for large databases,\nit can simply hardly contribute to accurate optical flow. To circumvent the\nneed for manual annotation, we propose a framework to automatically generate\noptical flow from real-world videos. The method extracts and matches objects\nfrom video frames to compute initial constraints, and applies a deformation\nover the objects of interest to obtain dense optical flow fields. We propose\nseveral ways to augment the optical flow variations. Extensive experimental\nresults show that training on our automatically generated optical flow\noutperforms methods that are trained on rigid synthetic data using FlowNet-S,\nLiteFlowNet, PWC-Net, and RAFT.

          "description": "Kinship verification from facial images has been recognized as an emerging\nyet challenging technique in many potential computer vision applications. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel cross-generation feature interaction learning\n(CFIL) framework for robust kinship verification. Particularly, an effective\ncollaborative weighting strategy is constructed to explore the characteristics\nof cross-generation relations by corporately extracting features of both\nparents and children image pairs. Specifically, we take parents and children as\na whole to extract the expressive local and non-local features. Different from\nthe traditional works measuring similarity by distance, we interpolate the\nsimilarity calculations as the interior auxiliary weights into the deep CNN\narchitecture to learn the whole and natural features. These similarity weights\nnot only involve corresponding single points but also excavate the multiple\nrelationships cross points, where local and non-local features are calculated\nby using these two kinds of distance measurements. Importantly, instead of\nseparately conducting similarity computation and feature extraction, we\nintegrate similarity learning and feature extraction into one unified learning\nprocess. The integrated representations deduced from local and non-local\nfeatures can comprehensively express the informative semantics embedded in\nimages and preserve abundant correlation knowledge from image pairs. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of the proposed model\ncompared to some state-of-the-art kinship verification methods.",

          "description": "Out of all existing frameworks for surgical workflow analysis in endoscopic\nvideos, action triplet recognition stands out as the only one aiming to provide\ntruly fine-grained and comprehensive information on surgical activities. This\ninformation, presented as <instrument, verb, target> combinations, is highly\nchallenging to be accurately identified. Triplet components can be difficult to\nrecognize individually; in this task, it requires not only performing\nrecognition simultaneously for all three triplet components, but also correctly\nestablishing the data association between them. To achieve this task, we\nintroduce our new model, the Rendezvous (RDV), which recognizes triplets\ndirectly from surgical videos by leveraging attention at two different levels.\nWe first introduce a new form of spatial attention to capture individual action\ntriplet components in a scene; called the Class Activation Guided Attention\nMechanism (CAGAM). This technique focuses on the recognition of verbs and\ntargets using activations resulting from instruments. To solve the association\nproblem, our RDV model adds a new form of semantic attention inspired by\nTransformer networks. Using multiple heads of cross and self attentions, RDV is\nable to effectively capture relationships between instruments, verbs, and\ntargets. We also introduce CholecT50 - a dataset of 50 endoscopic videos in\nwhich every frame has been annotated with labels from 100 triplet classes. Our\nproposed RDV model significantly improves the triplet prediction mAP by over 9%\ncompared to the state-of-the-art methods on this dataset.",

In contrast, we propose a simple approach to\nexploit unlabeled data accompanying the few-shot task for improving few-shot\nperformance. Firstly, we propose a Dependency Maximization method based on the\nHilbert-Schmidt norm of the cross-covariance operator, which maximizes the\nstatistical dependency between the embedded feature of those unlabeled data and\ntheir label predictions, together with the supervised loss over the support\nset. We then use the obtained model to infer the pseudo-labels for those\nunlabeled data.

We iterate the above process until the pseudo-labels for the\nunlabeled data becomes stable.

          "description": "Transformer, as a strong and flexible architecture for modelling long-range\nrelations, has been widely explored in vision tasks. However, when used in\nvideo inpainting that requires fine-grained representation, existed method\nstill suffers from yielding blurry edges in detail due to the hard patch\nsplitting. Here we aim to tackle this problem by proposing FuseFormer, a\nTransformer model designed for video inpainting via fine-grained feature fusion\nbased on novel Soft Split and Soft Composition operations. The soft split\ndivides feature map into many patches with given overlapping interval. On the\ncontrary, the soft composition operates by stitching different patches into a\nwhole feature map where pixels in overlapping regions are summed up. These two\nmodules are first used in tokenization before Transformer layers and\nde-tokenization after Transformer layers, for effective mapping between tokens\nand features. Therefore, sub-patch level information interaction is enabled for\nmore effective feature propagation between neighboring patches, resulting in\nsynthesizing vivid content for hole regions in videos. Moreover, in FuseFormer,\nwe elaborately insert the soft composition and soft split into the feed-forward\nnetwork, enabling the 1D linear layers to have the capability of modelling 2D\nstructure. And, the sub-patch level feature fusion ability is further enhanced.\nIn both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our proposed FuseFormer\nsurpasses state-of-the-art methods.

          "description": "The study of functional brain connectivity (FC) is important for\nunderstanding the underlying mechanisms of many psychiatric disorders. Many\nrecent analyses adopt graph convolutional networks, to study non-linear\ninteractions between functionally-correlated states. However, although patterns\nof brain activation are known to be hierarchically organised in both space and\ntime, many methods have failed to extract powerful spatio-temporal features. To\novercome those challenges, and improve understanding of long-range functional\ndynamics, we translate an approach, from the domain of skeleton-based action\nrecognition, designed to model interactions across space and time. We evaluate\nthis approach using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset on sex\nclassification and fluid intelligence prediction. To account for subject\ntopographic variability of functional organisation, we modelled functional\nconnectomes using multi-resolution dual-regressed (subject-specific) ICA nodes.\nResults show a prediction accuracy of 94.4% for sex classification (an increase\nof 6.2% compared to other methods), and an improvement of correlation with\nfluid intelligence of 0.325 vs 0.144, relative to a baseline model that encodes\nspace and time separately.

Alternatively, we can extract image features separately using\nclassical dimension reduction techniques such as, Principal Components Analysis\n(PCA) or Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) and use the extracted features to\ntrain a QNN. We review two proposals on quantum-classical hybrid ML models for\nimage classification namely, Quanvolutional Neural Network and dimension\nreduction using a classical algorithm followed by QNN. Particularly, we make a\ncase for trainable filters in Quanvolution and CAE-based feature extraction for\nimage datasets (instead of dimension reduction using linear transformations\nsuch as, PCA). We discuss various design choices, potential opportunities, and\ndrawbacks of these models. We also release a Python-based framework to create\nand explore these hybrid models with a variety of design choices.",

          "description": "Landmark-based robot self-localization has recently garnered interest as a\nhighly-compressive domain-invariant approach for performing visual place\nrecognition (VPR) across domains (e.g., time of day, weather, and season).\nHowever, landmark-based self-localization can be an ill-posed problem for a\npassive observer (e.g., manual robot control), as many viewpoints may not\nprovide an effective landmark view. In this study, we consider an active\nself-localization task by an active observer and present a novel reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-based next-best-view (NBV) planner. Our contributions are as\nfollows. (1) SIMBAD-based VPR: We formulate the problem of landmark-based\ncompact scene description as SIMBAD (similarity-based pattern recognition) and\nfurther present its deep learning extension. (2) VPR-to-NBV knowledge transfer:\nWe address the challenge of RL under uncertainty (i.e., active\nself-localization) by transferring the state recognition ability of VPR to the\nNBV. (3) NNQL-based NBV: We regard the available VPR as the experience database\nby adapting nearest-neighbor approximation of Q-learning (NNQL). The result\nshows an extremely compact data structure that compresses both the VPR and NBV\ninto a single incremental inverted index. Experiments using the public NCLT\ndataset validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

          "description": "In a regular open set detection problem, samples of known classes (also\ncalled closed set classes) are used to train a special classifier. In testing,\nthe classifier can (1) classify the test samples of known classes to their\nrespective classes and (2) also detect samples that do not belong to any of the\nknown classes (we say they belong to some unknown or open set classes). This\npaper studies the problem of zero-shot open-set detection, which still performs\nthe same two tasks in testing but has no training except using the given known\nclass names. This paper proposes a novel and yet simple method (called ZO-CLIP)\nto solve the problem. ZO-CLIP builds on top of the recent advances in zero-shot\nclassification through multi-modal representation learning. It first extends\nthe pre-trained multi-modal model CLIP by training a text-based image\ndescription generator on top of CLIP. In testing, it uses the extended model to\ngenerate some candidate unknown class names for each test sample and computes a\nconfidence score based on both the known class names and candidate unknown\nclass names for zero-shot open set detection. Experimental results on 5\nbenchmark datasets for open set detection confirm that ZO-CLIP outperforms the\nbaselines by a large margin.",

          "description": "Reducing traffic fatalities and serious injuries is a top priority of the US\nDepartment of Transportation. The computer vision (CV)-based crash anticipation\nin the near-crash phase is receiving growing attention. The ability to perceive\nfatal crash risks earlier is also critical because it will improve the\nreliability of crash anticipation. Yet, annotated image data for training a\nreliable AI model for the early visual perception of crash risks are not\nabundant. The Fatality Analysis Reporting System contains big data of fatal\ncrashes. It is a reliable data source for learning the relationship between\ndriving scene characteristics and fatal crashes to compensate for the\nlimitation of CV. Therefore, this paper develops a data analytics model, named\nscenario-wise, Spatio-temporal attention guidance, from fatal crash report\ndata, which can estimate the relevance of detected objects to fatal crashes\nfrom their environment and context information. First, the paper identifies\nfive sparse variables that allow for decomposing the 5-year fatal crash dataset\nto develop scenario-wise attention guidance. Then, exploratory analysis of\nlocation- and time-related variables of the crash report data suggests reducing\nfatal crashes to spatially defined groups. The group's temporal pattern is an\nindicator of the similarity of fatal crashes in the group. Hierarchical\nclustering and K-means clustering merge the spatially defined groups into six\nclusters according to the similarity of their temporal patterns. After that,\nassociation rule mining discovers the statistical relationship between the\ntemporal information of driving scenes with crash features, for each cluster.\nThe paper shows how the developed attention guidance supports the design and\nimplementation of a preliminary CV model that can identify objects of a\npossibility to involve in fatal crashes from their environment and context\ninformation.",

          "description": "Existing road pothole detection approaches can be classified as computer\nvision-based or machine learning-based. The former approaches typically employ\n2-D image analysis/understanding or 3-D point cloud modeling and segmentation\nalgorithms to detect road potholes from vision sensor data. The latter\napproaches generally address road pothole detection using convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) in an end-to-end manner. However, road potholes are not\nnecessarily ubiquitous and it is challenging to prepare a large well-annotated\ndataset for CNN training. In this regard, while computer vision-based methods\nwere the mainstream research trend in the past decade, machine learning-based\nmethods were merely discussed. Recently, we published the first stereo\nvision-based road pothole detection dataset and a novel disparity\ntransformation algorithm, whereby the damaged and undamaged road areas can be\nhighly distinguished. However, there are no benchmarks currently available for\nstate-of-the-art (SoTA) CNNs trained using either disparity images or\ntransformed disparity images. Therefore, in this paper, we first discuss the\nSoTA CNNs designed for semantic segmentation and evaluate their performance for\nroad pothole detection with extensive experiments. Additionally, inspired by\ngraph neural network (GNN), we propose a novel CNN layer, referred to as graph\nattention layer (GAL), which can be easily deployed in any existing CNN to\noptimize image feature representations for semantic segmentation. Our\nexperiments compare GAL-DeepLabv3+, our best-performing implementation, with\nnine SoTA CNNs on three modalities of training data: RGB images, disparity\nimages, and transformed disparity images. The experimental results suggest that\nour proposed GAL-DeepLabv3+ achieves the best overall pothole detection\naccuracy on all training data modalities.",

In this\nwork, we present a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), called DCNN-Match,\nthat learns to predict landmark correspondences in 3D images in a\nself-supervised manner. We explored five variants of DCNN-Match that use\ndifferent loss functions and tested DCNN-Match separately as well as in\ncombination with the open-source registration software Elastix to assess its\nimpact on a common DIR approach. We employed lower-abdominal Computed\nTomography (CT) scans from cervical cancer patients: 121 pelvic CT scan pairs\ncontaining simulated elastic transformations and 11 pairs demonstrating\nclinical deformations. Our results show significant improvement in DIR\nperformance when landmark correspondences predicted by DCNN-Match were used in\ncase of simulated as well as clinical deformations. We also observed that the\nspatial distribution of the automatically identified landmarks and the\nassociated matching errors affect the extent of improvement in DIR.

          "description": "While deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in various\ncomputer vision tasks, they often fail to generalize to new domains and subtle\nvariations of input images.

Moreover, these methods often degrade\nperformance of the model on clean images and do not generalize to out-of-domain\nsamples. In this paper we present Generative Adversarial Training, an approach\nto simultaneously improve the model's generalization to the test set and\nout-of-domain samples as well as its robustness to unseen adversarial attacks.\nInstead of altering a low-level pre-defined aspect of images, we generate a\nspectrum of low-level, mid-level and high-level changes using generative models\nwith a disentangled latent space.

          "description": "Few-shot classification (FSC) is one of the most concerned hot issues in\nrecent years. The general setting consists of two phases: (1) Pre-train a\nfeature extraction model (FEM) with base data (has large amounts of labeled\nsamples). (2) Use the FEM to extract the features of novel data (with few\nlabeled samples and totally different categories from base data), then classify\nthem with the to-be-designed classifier. The adaptability of pre-trained FEM to\nnovel data determines the accuracy of novel features, thereby affecting the\nfinal classification performances. To this end, how to appraise the pre-trained\nFEM is the most crucial focus in the FSC community. It sounds like traditional\nClass Activate Mapping (CAM) based methods can achieve this by overlaying\nweighted feature maps. However, due to the particularity of FSC (e.g., there is\nno backpropagation when using the pre-trained FEM to extract novel features),\nwe cannot activate the feature map with the novel classes. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a simple, flexible method, dubbed as Class-Irrelevant\nMapping (CIM). Specifically, first, we introduce dictionary learning theory and\nview the channels of the feature map as the bases in a dictionary. Then we\nutilize the feature map to fit the feature vector of an image to achieve the\ncorresponding channel weights. Finally, we overlap the weighted feature map for\nvisualization to appraise the ability of pre-trained FEM on novel data. For\nfair use of CIM in evaluating different models, we propose a new measurement\nindex, called Feature Localization Accuracy (FLA). In experiments, we first\ncompare our CIM with CAM in regular tasks and achieve outstanding performances.\nNext, we use our CIM to appraise several classical FSC frameworks without\nconsidering the classification results and discuss them.",

Thanks to recent advances in data acquisition and\ncomputation technologies, agriculture is evolving to a more smart and precision\nfarming to meet with the high yield and high quality crop production.\nClassification and recognition in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) images are\nimportant phases for crop monitoring. Advances in deep learning models relying\non Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have achieved high performances in image\nclassification in the agricultural domain. Despite the success of this\narchitecture, CNN still faces many challenges such as high computation cost,\nthe need of large labelled datasets, ... Natural language processing's\ntransformer architecture can be an alternative approach to deal with CNN's\nlimitations. Making use of the self-attention paradigm, Vision Transformer\n(ViT) models can achieve competitive or better results without applying any\nconvolution operations. In this paper, we adopt the self-attention mechanism\nvia the ViT models for plant classification of weeds and crops: red beet,\noff-type beet (green leaves), parsley and spinach. Our experiments show that\nwith small set of labelled training data, ViT models perform better compared to\nstate-of-the-art CNN-based models EfficientNet and ResNet, with a top accuracy\nof 99.8\\% achieved by the ViT model.",

          "description": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) achieve promising performance for\nskeleton-based action recognition. However, in most GCN-based methods, the\nspatial-temporal graph convolution is strictly restricted by the graph topology\nwhile only captures the short-term temporal context, thus lacking the\nflexibility of feature extraction. In this work, we present a novel\narchitecture, named Graph Convolutional skeleton Transformer (GCsT), which\naddresses limitations in GCNs by introducing Transformer. Our GCsT employs all\nthe benefits of Transformer (i.e. dynamical attention and global context) while\nkeeps the advantages of GCNs (i.e. hierarchy and local topology structure). In\nGCsT, the spatial-temporal GCN forces the capture of local dependencies while\nTransformer dynamically extracts global spatial-temporal relationships.\nFurthermore, the proposed GCsT shows stronger expressive capability by adding\nadditional information present in skeleton sequences. Incorporating the\nTransformer allows that information to be introduced into the model almost\neffortlessly. We validate the proposed GCsT by conducting extensive\nexperiments, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance on NTU RGB+D, NTU\nRGB+D 120 and Northwestern-UCLA datasets.",

          "description": "Humans can robustly recognize and localize objects by using visual and/or\nauditory cues. While machines are able to do the same with visual data already,\nless work has been done with sounds. This work develops an approach for scene\nunderstanding purely based on binaural sounds. The considered tasks include\npredicting the semantic masks of sound-making objects, the motion of\nsound-making objects, and the depth map of the scene. To this aim, we propose a\nnovel sensor setup and record a new audio-visual dataset of street scenes with\neight professional binaural microphones and a 360-degree camera. The\nco-existence of visual and audio cues is leveraged for supervision transfer. In\nparticular, we employ a cross-modal distillation framework that consists of\nmultiple vision teacher methods and a sound student method -- the student\nmethod is trained to generate the same results as the teacher methods do. This\nway, the auditory system can be trained without using human annotations. To\nfurther boost the performance, we propose another novel auxiliary task, coined\nSpatial Sound Super-Resolution, to increase the directional resolution of\nsounds. We then formulate the four tasks into one end-to-end trainable\nmulti-tasking network aiming to boost the overall performance. Experimental\nresults show that 1) our method achieves good results for all four tasks, 2)\nthe four tasks are mutually beneficial -- training them together achieves the\nbest performance, 3) the number and orientation of microphones are both\nimportant, and 4) features learned from the standard spectrogram and features\nobtained by the classic signal processing pipeline are complementary for\nauditory perception tasks.

Although being accurate, this approach is less practical as it\nrequires: (1) capturing pair of images by both camera devices with a color\ncalibration object placed in each new scene; (2) accurate image alignment or\nmanual annotation of the color calibration object.

          "description": "Image style transfer aims to manipulate the appearance of a source image, or\n\"content\" image, to share similar texture and colors of a target \"style\" image.\nIdeally, the style transfer manipulation should also preserve the semantic\ncontent of the source image. A commonly used approach to assist in transferring\nstyles is based on Gram matrix optimization. One problem of Gram matrix-based\noptimization is that it does not consider the correlation between colors and\ntheir styles. Specifically, certain textures or structures should be associated\nwith specific colors. This is particularly challenging when the target style\nimage exhibits multiple style types. In this work, we propose a color-aware\nmulti-style transfer method that generates aesthetically pleasing results while\npreserving the style-color correlation between style and generated images. We\nachieve this desired outcome by introducing a simple but efficient modification\nto classic Gram matrix-based style transfer optimization. A nice feature of our\nmethod is that it enables the users to manually select the color associations\nbetween the target style and content image for more transfer flexibility. We\nvalidated our method with several qualitative comparisons, including a user\nstudy conducted with 30 participants. In comparison with prior work, our method\nis simple, easy to implement, and achieves visually appealing results when\ntargeting images that have multiple styles.

          "description": "Dietary studies showed that dietary-related problem such as obesity is\nassociated with other chronic diseases like hypertension, irregular blood sugar\nlevels, and increased risk of heart attacks. The primary cause of these\nproblems is poor lifestyle choices and unhealthy dietary habits, which are\nmanageable using interactive mHealth apps. However, traditional dietary\nmonitoring systems using manual food logging suffer from imprecision,\nunderreporting, time consumption, and low adherence. Recent dietary monitoring\nsystems tackle these challenges by automatic assessment of dietary intake\nthrough machine learning methods. This survey discusses the most performing\nmethodologies that have been developed so far for automatic food recognition\nand volume estimation. First, we will present the rationale of visual-based\nmethods for food recognition. The core of the paper is the presentation,\ndiscussion and evaluation of these methods on popular food image databases.\nFollowing that, we discussed the mobile applications that are implementing\nthese methods. The survey ends with a discussion of research gaps and open\nissues in this area.",

          "description": "We introduce Neural Marching Cubes (NMC), a data-driven approach for\nextracting a triangle mesh from a discretized implicit field. Classical MC is\ndefined by coarse tessellation templates isolated to individual cubes. While\nmore refined tessellations have been proposed, they all make heuristic\nassumptions, such as trilinearity, when determining the vertex positions and\nlocal mesh topologies in each cube. In principle, none of these approaches can\nreconstruct geometric features that reveal coherence or dependencies between\nnearby cubes (e.g., a sharp edge), as such information is unaccounted for,\nresulting in poor estimates of the true underlying implicit field. To tackle\nthese challenges, we re-cast MC from a deep learning perspective, by designing\ntessellation templates more apt at preserving geometric features, and learning\nthe vertex positions and mesh topologies from training meshes, to account for\ncontextual information from nearby cubes. We develop a compact per-cube\nparameterization to represent the output triangle mesh, while being compatible\nwith neural processing, so that a simple 3D convolutional network can be\nemployed for the training. We show that all topological cases in each cube that\nare applicable to our design can be easily derived using our representation,\nand the resulting tessellations can also be obtained naturally and efficiently\nby following a few design guidelines. In addition, our network learns local\nfeatures with limited receptive fields, hence it generalizes well to new shapes\nand new datasets. We evaluate our neural MC approach by quantitative and\nqualitative comparisons to all well-known MC variants. In particular, we\ndemonstrate the ability of our network to recover sharp features such as edges\nand corners, a long-standing issue of MC and its variants. Our network also\nreconstructs local mesh topologies more accurately than previous approaches.",

          "description": "Autonomous vehicles must reason about spatial occlusions in urban\nenvironments to ensure safety without being overly cautious. Prior work\nexplored occlusion inference from observed social behaviors of road agents.\nInferring occupancy from agent behaviors is an inherently multimodal problem; a\ndriver may behave in the same manner for different occupancy patterns ahead of\nthem (e.g., a driver may move at constant speed in traffic or on an open road).\nPast work, however, does not account for this multimodality, thus neglecting to\nmodel this source of aleatoric uncertainty in the relationship between driver\nbehaviors and their environment. We propose an occlusion inference method that\ncharacterizes observed behaviors of human agents as sensor measurements, and\nfuses them with those from a standard sensor suite. To capture the aleatoric\nuncertainty, we train a conditional variational autoencoder with a discrete\nlatent space to learn a multimodal mapping from observed driver trajectories to\nan occupancy grid representation of the view ahead of the driver. Our method\nhandles multi-agent scenarios, combining measurements from multiple observed\ndrivers using evidential theory to solve the sensor fusion problem.

Despite of the success of previous works,\nexplorations on an effective training strategy for the saliency network and\naccurate matches between image-level annotations and salient objects are still\ninadequate. In this work, 1) we propose a self-calibrated training strategy by\nexplicitly establishing a mutual calibration loop between pseudo labels and\nnetwork predictions, liberating the saliency network from error-prone\npropagation caused by pseudo labels. 2) we prove that even a much smaller\ndataset (merely 1.8% of ImageNet) with well-matched annotations can facilitate\nmodels to achieve better performance as well as generalizability. This sheds\nnew light on the development of WSOD and encourages more contributions to the\ncommunity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms\nall the existing WSOD methods by adopting the self-calibrated strategy only.\nSteady improvements are further achieved by training on the proposed dataset.\nAdditionally, our method achieves 94.7% of the performance of fully-supervised\nmethods on average. And what is more, the fully supervised models adopting our\npredicted results as \"ground truths\" achieve successful results (95.6% for\nBASNet and 97.3% for ITSD on F-measure), while costing only 0.32% of labeling\ntime for pixel-level annotation.",

          "description": "From CNNs to attention mechanisms, encoding inductive biases into neural\nnetworks has been a fruitful source of improvement in machine learning. Adding\nauxiliary losses to the main objective function is a general way of encoding\nbiases that can help networks learn better representations. However, since\nauxiliary losses are minimized only on training data, they suffer from the same\ngeneralization gap as regular task losses. Moreover, by adding a term to the\nloss function, the model optimizes a different objective than the one we care\nabout. In this work we address both problems: first, we take inspiration from\n\\textit{transductive learning} and note that after receiving an input but\nbefore making a prediction, we can fine-tune our networks on any unsupervised\nloss. We call this process {\\em tailoring}, because we customize the model to\neach input to ensure our prediction satisfies the inductive bias. Second, we\nformulate {\\em meta-tailoring}, a nested optimization similar to that in\nmeta-learning, and train our models to perform well on the task objective after\nadapting them using an unsupervised loss. The advantages of tailoring and\nmeta-tailoring are discussed theoretically and demonstrated empirically on a\ndiverse set of examples.",

          "description": "Glioma is a common malignant brain tumor that shows distinct survival among\npatients. The isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene mutation status provides\ncritical diagnostic and prognostic value for glioma and is now accepted as the\nstandard of care. A non-invasive prediction of IDH mutation based on the\npre-treatment MRI has crucial clinical significance. Machine learning and deep\nlearning models show reasonable performance in predicting IDH mutation status.\nHowever, most models neglect the systematic brain alterations caused by tumor\ninvasion, where the infiltration along white matter tracts throughout the brain\nis identified as a hallmark of glioma. Structural brain network provides an\neffective tool to characterise brain organisation, which could be captured by\nthe graph neural networks (GNN) for a more accurate prediction of IDH mutation\nstatus.\n\nHere we propose a method to predict the IDH mutation using GNN, based on the\nstructural brain network of patients. Specifically, we firstly construct a\nnetwork template of healthy subjects, which consists of atlases of edges (white\nmatter tracts) and nodes (cortical and subcortical brain regions) to provide\nregions of interest (ROI). Next, we employ autoencoders to extract the latent\nmulti-modal MRI features from the ROIs of the edge and node in patients. These\nfeatures of edge and node of brain networks are used to train a GNN\narchitecture in predicting IDH mutation status. The results show that the\nproposed method outperforms the baseline models using 3D-CNN and 3D-DenseNet.\nIn addition, the model interpretation suggests its ability to identify the\ntracts infiltrated by tumor and corresponds to clinical prior knowledge. In\nconclusion, integrating brain networks with GNN offers a new avenue to study\nbrain lesions using computational neuroscience and computer vision approaches.",

We focus on a new possibility,\nthat is, to improve its resilience to weather interference through the\nnetwork's structural design. First, we propose a novel FPN structure called\nRiWFPN with a progressive top-down interaction and attention refinement module.\nRiWFPN can directly replace other FPN structures to improve the robustness of\nthe network in non-optimal weather conditions. Then we extend SOLOV2 to capture\ntemporal information in video to learn motion information, and propose a moving\nobject instance segmentation network with RiWFPN called RiWNet. Finally, in\norder to verify the effect of moving instance segmentation in different weather\ndisturbances, we propose a VKTTI-moving dataset which is a moving instance\nsegmentation dataset based on the VKTTI dataset, taking into account different\nweather scenes such as rain, fog, sunset, morning as well as overcast. The\nexperiment proves how RiWFPN improves the network's resilience to adverse\nweather effects compared to other FPN structures.

          "description": "While significant advancements have been made in the generation of deepfakes\nusing deep learning technologies, its misuse is a well-known issue now.\nDeepfakes can cause severe security and privacy issues as they can be used to\nimpersonate a person's identity in a video by replacing his/her face with\nanother person's face. Recently, a new problem of generating synthesized human\nvoice of a person is emerging, where AI-based deep learning models can\nsynthesize any person's voice requiring just a few seconds of audio. With the\nemerging threat of impersonation attacks using deepfake audios and videos, a\nnew generation of deepfake detectors is needed to focus on both video and audio\ncollectively. A large amount of good quality datasets is typically required to\ncapture the real-world scenarios to develop a competent deepfake detector.\nExisting deepfake datasets either contain deepfake videos or audios, which are\nracially biased as well. Hence, there is a crucial need for creating a good\nvideo as well as an audio deepfake dataset, which can be used to detect audio\nand video deepfake simultaneously. To fill this gap, we propose a novel\nAudio-Video Deepfake dataset (FakeAVCeleb) that contains not only deepfake\nvideos but also respective synthesized lip-synced fake audios. We generate this\ndataset using the current most popular deepfake generation methods. We selected\nreal YouTube videos of celebrities with four racial backgrounds (Caucasian,\nBlack, East Asian, and South Asian) to develop a more realistic multimodal\ndataset that addresses racial bias and further help develop multimodal deepfake\ndetectors. We performed several experiments using state-of-the-art detection\nmethods to evaluate our deepfake dataset and demonstrate the challenges and\nusefulness of our multimodal Audio-Video deepfake dataset.",

          "description": "Detection of objects is extremely important in various aerial vision-based\napplications. Over the last few years, the methods based on convolution neural\nnetworks have made substantial progress. However, because of the large variety\nof object scales, densities, and arbitrary orientations, the current detectors\nstruggle with the extraction of semantically strong features for small-scale\nobjects by a predefined convolution kernel. To address this problem, we propose\nthe rotation equivariant feature image pyramid network (REFIPN), an image\npyramid network based on rotation equivariance convolution. The proposed model\nadopts single-shot detector in parallel with a lightweight image pyramid module\nto extract representative features and generate regions of interest in an\noptimization approach. The proposed network extracts feature in a wide range of\nscales and orientations by using novel convolution filters. These features are\nused to generate vector fields and determine the weight and angle of the\nhighest-scoring orientation for all spatial locations on an image. By this\napproach, the performance for small-sized object detection is enhanced without\nsacrificing the performance for large-sized object detection. The performance\nof the proposed model is validated on two commonly used aerial benchmarks and\nthe results show our proposed model can achieve state-of-the-art performance\nwith satisfactory efficiency.",

          "description": "The optic nerve head represents the intraocular section of the optic nerve\n(ONH), which is prone to damage by intraocular pressure. The advent of optical\ncoherence tomography (OCT) has enabled the evaluation of novel optic nerve head\nparameters, namely the depth and curvature of the lamina cribrosa (LC).\nTogether with the Bruch's membrane opening minimum-rim-width, these seem to be\npromising optic nerve head parameters for diagnosis and monitoring of retinal\ndiseases such as glaucoma. Nonetheless, these optical coherence tomography\nderived biomarkers are mostly extracted through manual segmentation, which is\ntime-consuming and prone to bias, thus limiting their usability in clinical\npractice. The automatic segmentation of optic nerve head in OCT scans could\nfurther improve the current clinical management of glaucoma and other diseases.\n\nThis review summarizes the current state-of-the-art in automatic segmentation\nof the ONH in OCT. PubMed and Scopus were used to perform a systematic review.\nAdditional works from other databases (IEEE, Google Scholar and ARVO IOVS) were\nalso included, resulting in a total of 27 reviewed studies.\n\nFor each algorithm, the methods, the size and type of dataset used for\nvalidation, and the respective results were carefully analyzed. The results\nshow that deep learning-based algorithms provide the highest accuracy,\nsensitivity and specificity for segmenting the different structures of the ONH\nincluding the LC. However, a lack of consensus regarding the definition of\nsegmented regions, extracted parameters and validation approaches has been\nobserved, highlighting the importance and need of standardized methodologies\nfor ONH segmentation.",

However, automatic\nRV segmentation from MRI is still challenging, mainly due to the heterogeneous\nintensity, the complex variable shapes, and the unclear RV boundary. Moreover,\ncurrent methods for the RV segmentation tend to suffer from performance\ndegradation at the basal and apical slices of MRI. In this work, we propose an\nautomatic RV segmentation framework, where the information from long-axis (LA)\nviews is utilized to assist the segmentation of short-axis (SA) views via\ninformation transition. Specifically, we employed the transformed segmentation\nfrom LA views as a prior information, to extract the ROI from SA views for\nbetter segmentation. The information transition aims to remove the surrounding\nambiguous regions in the SA views. %, such as the tricuspid valve regions. We\ntested our model on a public dataset with 360 multi-center, multi-vendor and\nmulti-disease subjects that consist of both LA and SA MRIs.

This small subset\nof data points, which we term Pruning Identified Exemplars (PIEs) are\nsystematically more impacted by the introduction of sparsity.

          "description": "Neural networks (NNs) are widely used for object classification in autonomous\ndriving.

NNs often rely on\nsoftmax normalization for confidence estimation, which can lead to high\nconfidences being assigned to OOD samples, thus hindering the detection of\nfailures. This paper presents a method for determining whether inputs are OOD,\nwhich does not require OOD data during training and does not increase the\ncomputational cost of inference.

          "description": "We propose CX-ToM, short for counterfactual explanations with theory-of mind,\na new explainable AI (XAI) framework for explaining decisions made by a deep\nconvolutional neural network (CNN). In contrast to the current methods in XAI\nthat generate explanations as a single shot response, we pose explanation as an\niterative communication process, i.e. dialog, between the machine and human\nuser. More concretely, our CX-ToM framework generates sequence of explanations\nin a dialog by mediating the differences between the minds of machine and human\nuser. To do this, we use Theory of Mind (ToM) which helps us in explicitly\nmodeling human's intention, machine's mind as inferred by the human as well as\nhuman's mind as inferred by the machine. Moreover, most state-of-the-art XAI\nframeworks provide attention (or heat map) based explanations. In our work, we\nshow that these attention based explanations are not sufficient for increasing\nhuman trust in the underlying CNN model. In CX-ToM, we instead use\ncounterfactual explanations called fault-lines which we define as follows:\ngiven an input image I for which a CNN classification model M predicts class\nc_pred, a fault-line identifies the minimal semantic-level features (e.g.,\nstripes on zebra, pointed ears of dog), referred to as explainable concepts,\nthat need to be added to or deleted from I in order to alter the classification\ncategory of I by M to another specified class c_alt. We argue that, due to the\niterative, conceptual and counterfactual nature of CX-ToM explanations, our\nframework is practical and more natural for both expert and non-expert users to\nunderstand the internal workings of complex deep learning models. Extensive\nquantitative and qualitative experiments verify our hypotheses, demonstrating\nthat our CX-ToM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art explainable AI\nmodels.",

          "description": "Targets are essential in problems such as object tracking in cluttered or\ntextureless environments, camera (and multi-sensor) calibration tasks, and\nsimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Target shapes for these tasks\ntypically are symmetric (square, rectangular, or circular) and work well for\nstructured, dense sensor data such as pixel arrays (i.e., image). However,\nsymmetric shapes lead to pose ambiguity when using sparse sensor data such as\nLiDAR point clouds and suffer from the quantization uncertainty of the LiDAR.\nThis paper introduces the concept of optimizing target shape to remove pose\nambiguity for LiDAR point clouds. A target is designed to induce large\ngradients at edge points under rotation and translation relative to the LiDAR\nto ameliorate the quantization uncertainty associated with point cloud\nsparseness. Moreover, given a target shape, we present a means that leverages\nthe target's geometry to estimate the target's vertices while globally\nestimating the pose. Both the simulation and the experimental results (verified\nby a motion capture system) confirm that by using the optimal shape and the\nglobal solver, we achieve centimeter error in translation and a few degrees in\nrotation even when a partially illuminated target is placed 30 meters away.

In this\npaper, we show that a deep temporal-coded SNN can be trained easily and\ndirectly over the benchmark datasets CIFAR10 and ImageNet, with testing\naccuracy within 1% of the DNN of equivalent size and architecture. Training\nbecomes similar to DNN thanks to the closed-form solution to the spiking\nwaveform dynamics. Considering that SNNs should be implemented in practical\nneuromorphic hardwares, we train the deep SNN with weights quantized to 8, 4, 2\nbits and with weights perturbed by random noise to demonstrate its robustness\nin practical applications. In addition, we develop a phase-domain signal\nprocessing circuit schematic to implement our spiking neuron with 90% gain of\nenergy efficiency over existing work.

A forward model of the world supervises a\ndriving policy that predicts the outcome of any potential driving trajectory.\nTo support learning from pre-recorded logs, we assume that the world is on\nrails, meaning neither the agent nor its actions influence the environment.\nThis assumption greatly simplifies the learning problem, factorizing the\ndynamics into a nonreactive world model and a low-dimensional and compact\nforward model of the ego-vehicle. Our approach computes action-values for each\ntraining trajectory using a tabular dynamic-programming evaluation of the\nBellman equations; these action-values in turn supervise the final vision-based\ndriving policy. Despite the world-on-rails assumption, the final driving policy\nacts well in a dynamic and reactive world. At the time of writing, our method\nranks first on the CARLA leaderboard, attaining a 25% higher driving score\nwhile using 40 times less data.

For example, for one of the most common activation functions, the ReLU\nand its variants, even a well-calibrated model can produce incorrect but high\nconfidence predictions. In the related task of action recognition, most current\nclassification methods are based on clip-level classifiers that densely sample\na given video for non-overlapping, same-sized clips and aggregate the results\nusing an aggregation function - typically averaging - to achieve video level\npredictions. While this approach has shown to be effective, it is sub-optimal\nin recognition accuracy and has a high computational overhead. To mitigate both\nthese issues, we propose the confidence distillation framework to teach a\nrepresentation of uncertainty of the teacher to the student sampler and divide\nthe task of full video prediction between the student and the teacher models.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on three action recognition datasets and\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements in action\nrecognition accuracy (up to 20%) and computational efficiency (more than 40%).",

While committee-based models\nthemselves are not new, there lacks a systematic understanding of their\nefficiency in comparison with single models. To fill this gap, we conduct a\ncomprehensive analysis of the efficiency of committee-based models. We find\nthat committee-based models provide a complementary paradigm to achieve\nsuperior efficiency without tuning the architecture: even the most simplistic\nmethod for building ensembles or cascades from existing pre-trained networks\ncan attain a significant speedup and higher accuracy over state-of-the-art\nsingle models, and also outperforms sophisticated neural architecture search\nmethods (e.g., BigNAS). The superior efficiency of committee-based models holds\ntrue for several tasks, including image classification, video classification,\nand semantic segmentation, and various architecture families, such as\nEfficientNet, ResNet, MobileNetV2, and X3D.",

          "description": "Network quantization, which aims to reduce the bit-lengths of the network\nweights and activations, has emerged for their deployments to resource-limited\ndevices. Although recent studies have successfully discretized a full-precision\nnetwork, they still incur large quantization errors after training, thus giving\nrise to a significant performance gap between a full-precision network and its\nquantized counterpart. In this work, we propose a novel quantization method for\nneural networks, Cluster-Promoting Quantization (CPQ) that finds the optimal\nquantization grids while naturally encouraging the underlying full-precision\nweights to gather around those quantization grids cohesively during training.\nThis property of CPQ is thanks to our two main ingredients that enable\ndifferentiable quantization: i) the use of the categorical distribution\ndesigned by a specific probabilistic parametrization in the forward pass and\nii) our proposed multi-class straight-through estimator (STE) in the backward\npass. Since our second component, multi-class STE, is intrinsically biased, we\nadditionally propose a new bit-drop technique, DropBits, that revises the\nstandard dropout regularization to randomly drop bits instead of neurons. As a\nnatural extension of DropBits, we further introduce the way of learning\nheterogeneous quantization levels to find proper bit-length for each layer by\nimposing an additional regularization on DropBits. We experimentally validate\nour method on various benchmark datasets and network architectures, and also\nsupport a new hypothesis for quantization: learning heterogeneous quantization\nlevels outperforms the case using the same but fixed quantization levels from\nscratch.",

We employ our method to generate a number of\n445,446 (90%) samples of masks for the CASIA-WebFace data set and 196,254\n(96.8%) masks for the CelebA data set, releasing the mask images at\nhttps://github.com/securifai/masked_faces. We show that our method produces\nsignificantly more realistic training examples of masks overlaid on faces by\nasking volunteers to qualitatively compare it to other methods or data sets\ndesigned for the same task. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our method by\nevaluating state-of-the-art face recognition systems (FaceNet, VGG-face,\nArcFace) trained on the enhanced data sets and showing that they outperform\nequivalent systems trained on the original data sets (containing faces without\nmasks), when the test benchmark contains masked faces.",

          "description": "As a kind of new expression elements, Internet memes are popular and\nextensively used in online chatting scenarios since they manage to make\ndialogues vivid, moving, and interesting. However, most current dialogue\nresearches focus on text-only dialogue tasks. In this paper, we propose a new\ntask named as \\textbf{M}eme incorporated \\textbf{O}pen-domain \\textbf{D}ialogue\n(MOD). Compared to previous dialogue tasks, MOD is much more challenging since\nit requires the model to understand the multimodal elements as well as the\nemotions behind them. To facilitate the MOD research, we construct a\nlarge-scale open-domain multimodal dialogue dataset incorporating abundant\nInternet memes into utterances. The dataset consists of $\\sim$45K Chinese\nconversations with $\\sim$606K utterances. Each conversation contains about $13$\nutterances with about $4$ Internet memes on average and each utterance equipped\nwith an Internet meme is annotated with the corresponding emotion. In addition,\nwe present a simple and effective method, which utilizes a unified generation\nnetwork to solve the MOD task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\ntrained on the proposed corpus is able to achieve expressive communication\nincluding texts and memes. The corpus and models have been publicly available\nat https://github.com/lizekang/DSTC10-MOD.",

          "description": "Humans (e.g., crowdworkers) have a remarkable ability in solving different\ntasks, by simply reading textual instructions that define them and looking at a\nfew examples. NLP models built with the conventional paradigm, however, often\nstruggle with generalization across tasks (e.g., a question-answering system\ncannot solve classification tasks). A long-standing challenge in AI is to build\na model that is equipped with the understanding of human-readable instructions\nthat define the tasks, and can generalize to new tasks. To study this, we\nintroduce NATURAL INSTRUCTIONS, a dataset of 61 distinct tasks, their\nhuman-authored instructions and 193k task instances. The instructions are\nobtained from crowdsourcing instructions used to collect existing NLP datasets\nand mapped to a unified schema. We adopt generative pre-trained language models\nto encode task-specific instructions along with input and generate task output.\nOur results indicate that models can benefit from instructions to generalize\nacross tasks. These models, however, are far behind supervised task-specific\nmodels, indicating significant room for more progress in this direction.",

However, it is difficult to tell beforehand if a DNN receiving an\ninput will deliver the correct output since their decision criteria are usually\nnontransparent.

In this case, the information\ncontained in the input sample is processed reasonably by the network. It is of\nlarge practical importance to assess at inference time if a DNN generalizes\ncorrectly. Currently, the approaches to achieve this goal are investigated in\ndifferent problem set-ups rather independently from one another, leading to\nthree main research and literature fields: predictive uncertainty,\nout-of-distribution detection and adversarial example detection. This survey\nconnects the three fields within the larger framework of investigating the\ngeneralization performance of machine learning methods and in particular DNNs.\nWe underline the common ground, point at the most promising approaches and give\na structured overview of the methods that provide at inference time means to\nestablish if the current input is within the generalization envelope of a DNN.",

We also observe that the\nview-dependent specular reflection is very weak in the underwater environment,\nresulting the angularly sampled rays in light field has uniform intensity.

          "description": "Traffic accident anticipation aims to accurately and promptly predict the\noccurrence of a future accident from dashcam videos, which is vital for a\nsafety-guaranteed self-driving system. To encourage an early and accurate\ndecision, existing approaches typically focus on capturing the cues of spatial\nand temporal context before a future accident occurs. However, their\ndecision-making lacks visual explanation and ignores the dynamic interaction\nwith the environment. In this paper, we propose Deep ReInforced accident\nanticipation with Visual Explanation, named DRIVE. The method simulates both\nthe bottom-up and top-down visual attention mechanism in a dashcam observation\nenvironment so that the decision from the proposed stochastic multi-task agent\ncan be visually explained by attentive regions. Moreover, the proposed dense\nanticipation reward and sparse fixation reward are effective in training the\nDRIVE model with our improved reinforcement learning algorithm. Experimental\nresults show that the DRIVE model achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nmultiple real-world traffic accident datasets.

          "description": "Multi-view representation learning captures comprehensive information from\nmultiple views of a shared context. Recent works intuitively apply contrastive\nlearning (CL) to learn representations, regarded as a pairwise manner, which is\nstill scalable: view-specific noise is not filtered in learning view-shared\nrepresentations; the fake negative pairs, where the negative terms are actually\nwithin the same class as the positive, and the real negative pairs are\ncoequally treated; and evenly measuring the similarities between terms might\ninterfere with optimization. Importantly, few works research the theoretical\nframework of generalized self-supervised multi-view learning, especially for\nmore than two views. To this end, we rethink the existing multi-view learning\nparadigm from the information theoretical perspective and then propose a novel\ninformation theoretical framework for generalized multi-view learning. Guided\nby it, we build a multi-view coding method with a three-tier progressive\narchitecture, namely Information theory-guided heuristic Progressive Multi-view\nCoding (IPMC). In the distribution-tier, IPMC aligns the distribution between\nviews to reduce view-specific noise. In the set-tier, IPMC builds self-adjusted\npools for contrasting, which utilizes a view filter to adaptively modify the\npools. Lastly, in the instance-tier, we adopt a designed unified loss to learn\ndiscriminative representations and reduce the gradient interference.\nTheoretically and empirically, we demonstrate the superiority of IPMC over\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

The paper proposes a new audiovisual multi-task\nnetwork to address the critical challenges in crowd counting by effectively\nutilizing both visual and audio inputs for better modalities association and\nproductive feature extraction. The proposed network introduces the notion of\nauxiliary and explicit image patch-importance ranking (PIR) and patch-wise\ncrowd estimate (PCE) information to produce a third (run-time) modality. These\nmodalities (audio, visual, run-time) undergo a transformer-inspired\ncross-modality co-attention mechanism to finally output the crowd estimate.

          "description": "Image compression is a method to remove spatial redundancy between adjacent\npixels and reconstruct a high-quality image. In the past few years, deep\nlearning has gained huge attention from the research community and produced\npromising image reconstruction results. Therefore, recent methods focused on\ndeveloping deeper and more complex networks, which significantly increased\nnetwork complexity. In this paper, two effective novel blocks are developed:\nanalysis and synthesis block that employs the convolution layer and Generalized\nDivisive Normalization (GDN) in the variable-rate encoder and decoder side. Our\nnetwork utilizes a pixel RNN approach for quantization. Furthermore, to improve\nthe whole network, we encode a residual image using LSTM cells to reduce\nunnecessary information. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed\nvariable-rate framework with novel blocks outperforms existing methods and\nstandard image codecs, such as George's ~\\cite{002} and JPEG in terms of image\nsimilarity.

          "description": "Hyperspectral images (HSI) consist of rich spatial and spectral information,\nwhich can potentially be used for several applications. However, noise, band\ncorrelations and high dimensionality restrict the applicability of such data.\nThis is recently addressed using creative deep learning network architectures\nsuch as ResNet, SSRN, and A2S2K. However, the last layer, i.e the\nclassification layer, remains unchanged and is taken to be the softmax\nclassifier. In this article, we propose to use a watershed classifier.\nWatershed classifier extends the watershed operator from Mathematical\nMorphology for classification. In its vanilla form, the watershed classifier\ndoes not have any trainable parameters. In this article, we propose a novel\napproach to train deep learning networks to obtain representations suitable for\nthe watershed classifier. The watershed classifier exploits the connectivity\npatterns, a characteristic of HSI datasets, for better inference. We show that\nexploiting such characteristics allows the Triplet-Watershed to achieve\nstate-of-art results in supervised and semi-supervised contexts. These results\nare validated on Indianpines (IP), University of Pavia (UP), Kennedy Space\nCenter (KSC) and University of Houston (UH) datasets, relying on simple convnet\narchitecture using a quarter of parameters compared to previous\nstate-of-the-art networks.

          "description": "An effective perception system is a fundamental component for farming robots,\nas it enables them to properly perceive the surrounding environment and to\ncarry out targeted operations. The most recent methods make use of\nstate-of-the-art machine learning techniques to learn a valid model for the\ntarget task. However, those techniques need a large amount of labeled data for\ntraining. A recent approach to deal with this issue is data augmentation\nthrough Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), where entire synthetic scenes\nare added to the training data, thus enlarging and diversifying their\ninformative content. In this work, we propose an alternative solution with\nrespect to the common data augmentation methods, applying it to the fundamental\nproblem of crop/weed segmentation in precision farming. Starting from real\nimages, we create semi-artificial samples by replacing the most relevant object\nclasses (i.e., crop and weeds) with their synthesized counterparts. To do that,\nwe employ a conditional GAN (cGAN), where the generative model is trained by\nconditioning the shape of the generated object. Moreover, in addition to RGB\ndata, we take into account also near-infrared (NIR) information, generating\nfour channel multi-spectral synthetic images. Quantitative experiments, carried\nout on three publicly available datasets, show that (i) our model is capable of\ngenerating realistic multi-spectral images of plants and (ii) the usage of such\nsynthetic images in the training process improves the segmentation performance\nof state-of-the-art semantic segmentation convolutional networks.",

In studying the empirical\nperformance we note that there are few failure cases reported in the\nliterature, in particular for estimation problems with a single rotation,\nmotivating us to gain further theoretical understanding.\n\nA general framework based on tools from algebraic geometry is introduced for\nanalyzing the power of semidefinite relaxations of problems with quadratic\nobjective functions and rotational constraints.

Whereas\nuncertainty quantification is a long-standing problem in Machine Learning, it\nhas been largely overlooked in the recent NeRF literature.

This distribution allows to quantify the\nuncertainty associated with the scene information provided by the model. S-NeRF\noptimization is posed as a Bayesian learning problem which is efficiently\naddressed using the Variational Inference framework.

          "description": "Online continual learning for image classification studies the problem of\nlearning to classify images from an online stream of data and tasks, where\ntasks may include new classes (class incremental) or data nonstationarity\n(domain incremental). One of the key challenges of continual learning is to\navoid catastrophic forgetting (CF), i.e., forgetting old tasks in the presence\nof more recent tasks. Over the past few years, many methods and tricks have\nbeen introduced to address this problem, but many have not been fairly and\nsystematically compared under a variety of realistic and practical settings. To\nbetter understand the relative advantages of various approaches and the\nsettings where they work best, this survey aims to (1) compare state-of-the-art\nmethods such as MIR, iCARL, and GDumb and determine which works best at\ndifferent experimental settings; (2) determine if the best class incremental\nmethods are also competitive in domain incremental setting; (3) evaluate the\nperformance of 7 simple but effective trick such as \"review\" trick and nearest\nclass mean (NCM) classifier to assess their relative impact. Regarding (1), we\nobserve iCaRL remains competitive when the memory buffer is small; GDumb\noutperforms many recently proposed methods in medium-size datasets and MIR\nperforms the best in larger-scale datasets. For (2), we note that GDumb\nperforms quite poorly while MIR -- already competitive for (1) -- is also\nstrongly competitive in this very different but important setting. Overall,\nthis allows us to conclude that MIR is overall a strong and versatile method\nacross a wide variety of settings. For (3), we find that all 7 tricks are\nbeneficial, and when augmented with the \"review\" trick and NCM classifier, MIR\nproduces performance levels that bring online continual learning much closer to\nits ultimate goal of matching offline training.",

In this work, we\npropose a multi-scale, multi-level attention embedded CNN architecture\n((M)SLAe-Net) to address the issue of multi-stage processing for robust and\nprecise segmentation of retinal vessels. We do this by extracting features at\nmultiple scales and multiple levels of the network, enabling our model to\nholistically extracts the local and global features. Multi-scale features are\nextracted using our novel dynamic dilated pyramid pooling (D-DPP) module. We\nalso aggregate the features from all the network levels. These effectively\nresolved the issues of varying shapes and artefacts and hence the need for\nmultiple stages. To assist in better pixel-level classification, we use the\nSqueeze and Attention(SA) module, a smartly adapted version of the Squeeze and\nExcitation(SE) module for segmentation tasks in our network to facilitate\npixel-group attention.

          "description": "In this paper, we investigate the problem of facial kinship verification by\nlearning hierarchical reasoning graph networks. Conventional methods usually\nfocus on learning discriminative features for each facial image of a paired\nsample and neglect how to fuse the obtained two facial image features and\nreason about the relations between them. To address this, we propose a\nStar-shaped Reasoning Graph Network (S-RGN). Our S-RGN first constructs a\nstar-shaped graph where each surrounding node encodes the information of\ncomparisons in a feature dimension and the central node is employed as the\nbridge for the interaction of surrounding nodes. Then we perform relational\nreasoning on this star graph with iterative message passing. The proposed S-RGN\nuses only one central node to analyze and process information from all\nsurrounding nodes, which limits its reasoning capacity. We further develop a\nHierarchical Reasoning Graph Network (H-RGN) to exploit more powerful and\nflexible capacity. More specifically, our H-RGN introduces a set of latent\nreasoning nodes and constructs a hierarchical graph with them.

Most of the approaches proposed for\nfair classification require diverse data that represent the different\ndemographic groups involved.

          "description": "The goal of object navigation is to reach the expected objects according to\nvisual information in the unseen environments. Previous works usually implement\ndeep models to train an agent to predict actions in real-time. However, in the\nunseen environment, when the target object is not in egocentric view, the agent\nmay not be able to make wise decisions due to the lack of guidance. In this\npaper, we propose a hierarchical object-to-zone (HOZ) graph to guide the agent\nin a coarse-to-fine manner, and an online-learning mechanism is also proposed\nto update HOZ according to the real-time observation in new environments. In\nparticular, the HOZ graph is composed of scene nodes, zone nodes and object\nnodes. With the pre-learned HOZ graph, the real-time observation and the target\ngoal, the agent can constantly plan an optimal path from zone to zone. In the\nestimated path, the next potential zone is regarded as sub-goal, which is also\nfed into the deep reinforcement learning model for action prediction. Our\nmethods are evaluated on the AI2-Thor simulator. In addition to widely used\nevaluation metrics SR and SPL, we also propose a new evaluation metric of SAE\nthat focuses on the effective action rate. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.",

          "description": "Purpose: Static cardiac imaging such as late gadolinium enhancement, mapping,\nor 3-D coronary angiography require prior information, e.g., the phase during a\ncardiac cycle with least motion, called resting phase (RP). The purpose of this\nwork is to propose a fully automated framework that allows the detection of the\nright coronary artery (RCA) RP within CINE series. Methods: The proposed\nprototype system consists of three main steps. First, the localization of the\nregions of interest (ROI) is performed. Second, as CINE series are\ntime-resolved, the cropped ROI series over all time points are taken for\ntracking motions quantitatively. Third, the output motion values are used to\nclassify RPs. In this work, we focused on the detection of the area with the\nouter edge of the cross-section of the RCA as our target. The proposed\nframework was evaluated on 102 clinically acquired dataset at 1.5T and 3T. The\nautomatically classified RPs were compared with the ground truth RPs annotated\nmanually by a medical expert for testing the robustness and feasibility of the\nframework. Results: The predicted RCA RPs showed high agreement with the\nexperts annotated RPs with 92.7% accuracy, 90.5% sensitivity and 95.0%\nspecificity for the unseen study dataset. The mean absolute difference of the\nstart and end RP was 13.6 ${\\pm}$ 18.6 ms for the validation study dataset\n(n=102). Conclusion: In this work, automated RP detection has been introduced\nby the proposed framework and demonstrated feasibility, robustness, and\napplicability for diverse static imaging acquisitions.",

          "description": "Model compression techniques are recently gaining explosive attention for\nobtaining efficient AI models for various real-time applications. Channel\npruning is one important compression strategy and is widely used in slimming\nvarious DNNs. Previous gate-based or importance-based pruning methods aim to\nremove channels whose importance is smallest. However, it remains unclear what\ncriteria the channel importance should be measured on, leading to various\nchannel selection heuristics. Some other sampling-based pruning methods deploy\nsampling strategies to train sub-nets, which often causes the training\ninstability and the compressed model's degraded performance. In view of the\nresearch gaps, we present a new module named Gates with Differentiable\nPolarization (GDP), inspired by principled optimization ideas. GDP can be\nplugged before convolutional layers without bells and whistles, to control the\non-and-off of each channel or whole layer block. During the training process,\nthe polarization effect will drive a subset of gates to smoothly decrease to\nexact zero, while other gates gradually stay away from zero by a large margin.\nWhen training terminates, those zero-gated channels can be painlessly removed,\nwhile other non-zero gates can be absorbed into the succeeding convolution\nkernel, causing completely no interruption to training nor damage to the\ntrained model. Experiments conducted over CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets show\nthat the proposed GDP algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance on\nvarious benchmark DNNs at a broad range of pruning ratios. We also apply GDP to\nDeepLabV3Plus-ResNet50 on the challenging Pascal VOC segmentation task, whose\ntest performance sees no drop (even slightly improved) with over 60% FLOPs\nsaving.",

          "description": "Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM) has been a popular\nalgorithmic framework for separable optimization problems with linear\nconstraints. For numerical ADMM fail to exploit the particular structure of the\nproblem at hand nor the input data information, leveraging task-specific\nmodules (e.g., neural networks and other data-driven architectures) to extend\nADMM is a significant but challenging task. This work focuses on designing a\nflexible algorithmic framework to incorporate various task-specific modules\n(with no additional constraints) to improve the performance of ADMM in\nreal-world applications. Specifically, we propose Guidance from Optimality\n(GO), a new customization strategy, to embed task-specific modules into ADMM\n(GO-ADMM). By introducing an optimality-based criterion to guide the\npropagation, GO-ADMM establishes an updating scheme agnostic to the choice of\nadditional modules. The existing task-specific methods just plug their\ntask-specific modules into the numerical iterations in a straightforward\nmanner. Even with some restrictive constraints on the plug-in modules, they can\nonly obtain some relatively weaker convergence properties for the resulted ADMM\niterations. Fortunately, without any restrictions on the embedded modules, we\nprove the convergence of GO-ADMM regarding objective values and constraint\nviolations, and derive the worst-case convergence rate measured by iteration\ncomplexity. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical\nresults and demonstrate the efficiency of GO-ADMM.",

Motion is crucial for\nlandscape animation as it determines how objects move in videos. Existing\nmethods are able to generate appealing videos by learning motion from real\ntime-lapse videos. However, current methods suffer from inaccurate motion\ngeneration, which leads to unrealistic video results. To tackle this problem,\nwe propose a model named FGLA to generate high-quality and realistic videos by\nlearning Fine-Grained motion embedding for Landscape Animation. Our model\nconsists of two parts: (1) a motion encoder which embeds time-lapse motion in a\nfine-grained way. (2) a motion generator which generates realistic motion to\nanimate input images. To train and evaluate on diverse time-lapse videos, we\nbuild the largest high-resolution Time-lapse video dataset with Diverse scenes,\nnamely Time-lapse-D, which includes 16,874 video clips with over 10 million\nframes. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method.

          "description": "The rapid emergence of high-dimensional data in various areas has brought new\nchallenges to current ensemble clustering research. To deal with the curse of\ndimensionality, recently considerable efforts in ensemble clustering have been\nmade by means of different subspace-based techniques. However, besides the\nemphasis on subspaces, rather limited attention has been paid to the potential\ndiversity in similarity/dissimilarity metrics. It remains a surprisingly open\nproblem in ensemble clustering how to create and aggregate a large population\nof diversified metrics, and furthermore, how to jointly investigate the\nmulti-level diversity in the large populations of metrics, subspaces, and\nclusters in a unified framework. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a\nnovel multidiversified ensemble clustering approach. In particular, we create a\nlarge number of diversified metrics by randomizing a scaled exponential\nsimilarity kernel, which are then coupled with random subspaces to form a large\nset of metric-subspace pairs. Based on the similarity matrices derived from\nthese metric-subspace pairs, an ensemble of diversified base clusterings can\nthereby be constructed. Further, an entropy-based criterion is utilized to\nexplore the cluster-wise diversity in ensembles, based on which three specific\nensemble clustering algorithms are presented by incorporating three types of\nconsensus functions. Extensive experiments are conducted on 30 high-dimensional\ndatasets, including 18 cancer gene expression datasets and 12 image/speech\ndatasets, which demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms over the\nstate-of-the-art.

The square root formulation\npervades three major aspects of our optimization-based sliding-window\nestimator: for bundle adjustment we eliminate landmark variables with nullspace\nprojection; to store the marginalization prior we employ a matrix square root\nof the Hessian; and when marginalizing old poses we avoid forming normal\nequations and update the square root prior directly with a specialized QR\ndecomposition. We show that the proposed square root marginalization is\nalgebraically equivalent to the conventional use of Schur complement (SC) on\nthe Hessian. Moreover, it elegantly deals with rank-deficient Jacobians\nproducing a prior equivalent to SC with Moore-Penrose inverse. Our evaluation\nof visual and visual-inertial odometry on real-world datasets demonstrates that\nthe proposed estimator is 36% faster than the baseline. It furthermore shows\nthat in single precision, conventional Hessian-based marginalization leads to\nnumeric failures and reduced accuracy. We analyse numeric properties of the\nmarginalization prior to explain why our square root form does not suffer from\nthe same effect and therefore entails superior performance.",

          "description": "Visual emotion analysis (VEA) has attracted great attention recently, due to\nthe increasing tendency of expressing and understanding emotions through images\non social networks. Different from traditional vision tasks, VEA is inherently\nmore challenging since it involves a much higher level of complexity and\nambiguity in human cognitive process. Most of the existing methods adopt deep\nlearning techniques to extract general features from the whole image,\ndisregarding the specific features evoked by various emotional stimuli.\nInspired by the \\textit{Stimuli-Organism-Response (S-O-R)} emotion model in\npsychological theory, we proposed a stimuli-aware VEA method consisting of\nthree stages, namely stimuli selection (S), feature extraction (O) and emotion\nprediction (R). First, specific emotional stimuli (i.e., color, object, face)\nare selected from images by employing the off-the-shelf tools. To the best of\nour knowledge, it is the first time to introduce stimuli selection process into\nVEA in an end-to-end network. Then, we design three specific networks, i.e.,\nGlobal-Net, Semantic-Net and Expression-Net, to extract distinct emotional\nfeatures from different stimuli simultaneously. Finally, benefiting from the\ninherent structure of Mikel's wheel, we design a novel hierarchical\ncross-entropy loss to distinguish hard false examples from easy ones in an\nemotion-specific manner. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method\nconsistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on four public visual\nemotion datasets. Ablation study and visualizations further prove the validity\nand interpretability of our method.",

          "description": "The recent achievements of Deep Learning rely on the test data being similar\nin distribution to the training data. In an ideal case, Deep Learning models\nwould achieve Out-of-Distribution (OoD) Generalization, i.e. reliably make\npredictions on out-of-distribution data. Yet in practice, models usually fail\nto generalize well when facing a shift in distribution. Several methods were\nthereby designed to improve the robustness of the features learned by a model\nthrough Regularization- or Domain-Prediction-based schemes. Segmenting medical\nimages such as MRIs of the hippocampus is essential for the diagnosis and\ntreatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.

In this work, we evaluate OoD Generalization\nsolutions for the problem of hippocampus segmentation in MR data using both\nfully- and semi-supervised training.

          "description": "Event cameras are novel sensors that perceive the per-pixel intensity changes\nand output asynchronous event streams with high dynamic range and less motion\nblur. It has been shown that events alone can be used for end-task learning,\n\\eg, semantic segmentation, based on encoder-decoder-like networks. However, as\nevents are sparse and mostly reflect edge information, it is difficult to\nrecover original details merely relying on the decoder. Moreover, most methods\nresort to pixel-wise loss alone for supervision, which might be insufficient to\nfully exploit the visual details from sparse events, thus leading to less\noptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet flexible two-stream\nframework named Dual Transfer Learning (DTL) to effectively enhance the\nperformance on the end-tasks without adding extra inference cost. The proposed\napproach consists of three parts: event to end-task learning (EEL) branch,\nevent to image translation (EIT) branch, and transfer learning (TL) module that\nsimultaneously explores the feature-level affinity information and pixel-level\nknowledge from the EIT branch to improve the EEL branch.

Although\nmany continual learning methods are proposed to mitigate this drawback, the\nmain question remains unanswered: what is the root cause of catastrophic\nforgetting? In this work, we aim at answering this question by posing and\nvalidating a set of research hypotheses related to the specificity of\nrepresentations built internally by neural models. More specifically, we design\na set of empirical evaluations that compare the robustness of representations\nin discriminative and generative models against catastrophic forgetting.

          "description": "Personalized video highlight detection aims to shorten a long video to\ninteresting moments according to a user's preference, which has recently raised\nthe community's attention. Current methods regard the user's history as\nholistic information to predict the user's preference but negating the inherent\ndiversity of the user's interests, resulting in vague preference\nrepresentation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient preference\nreasoning framework (PR-Net) to explicitly take the diverse interests into\naccount for frame-level highlight prediction. Specifically, distinct\nuser-specific preferences for each input query frame are produced, presented as\nthe similarity weighted sum of history highlights to the corresponding query\nframe. Next, distinct comprehensive preferences are formed by the user-specific\npreferences and a learnable generic preference for more overall highlight\nmeasurement. Lastly, the degree of highlight and non-highlight for each query\nframe is calculated as semantic similarity to its comprehensive and\nnon-highlight preferences, respectively. Besides, to alleviate the ambiguity\ndue to the incomplete annotation, a new bi-directional contrastive loss is\nproposed to ensure a compact and differentiable metric space. In this way, our\nmethod significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a relative\nimprovement of 12% in mean accuracy precision.",

However, the lack of proper co-saliency and the absence\nof multiple foreground objects in these datasets can lead to spurious\nvariations and inherent biases learned by models.

          "description": "Radiomics is an active area of research focusing on high throughput feature\nextraction from medical images with a wide array of applications in clinical\npractice, such as clinical decision support in oncology. However, noise in low\ndose computed tomography (CT) scans can impair the accurate extraction of\nradiomic features. In this article, we investigate the possibility of using\ndeep learning generative models to improve the performance of radiomics from\nlow dose CTs. We used two datasets of low dose CT scans -NSCLC Radiogenomics\nand LIDC-IDRI - as test datasets for two tasks - pre-treatment survival\nprediction and lung cancer diagnosis. We used encoder-decoder networks and\nconditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) trained in a previous study\nas generative models to transform low dose CT images into full dose CT images.\nRadiomic features extracted from the original and improved CT scans were used\nto build two classifiers - a support vector machine (SVM) and a deep attention\nbased multiple instance learning model - for survival prediction and lung\ncancer diagnosis respectively. Finally, we compared the performance of the\nmodels derived from the original and improved CT scans. Encoder-decoder\nnetworks and CGANs improved the area under the curve (AUC) of survival\nprediction from 0.52 to 0.57 (p-value<0.01). On the other hand, Encoder-decoder\nnetwork and CGAN can improve the AUC of lung cancer diagnosis from 0.84 to 0.88\nand 0.89 respectively (p-value<0.01). Moreover, there are no statistically\nsignificant differences in improving AUC by using encoder-decoder network and\nCGAN (p-value=0.34) when networks trained at 75 and 100 epochs. Generative\nmodels can improve the performance of low dose CT-based radiomics in different\ntasks. Hence, denoising using generative models seems to be a necessary\npre-processing step for calculating radiomic features from low dose CTs.",

An U-Net\nbased network with perceptual loss is trained on a benchmark dataset and\nfine-tuned using one subject-specific static high resolution MRI as prior\nknowledge to obtain high resolution dynamic images during the inference stage.\n3D dynamic data for three subjects were acquired with different parameters to\ntest the generalisation capabilities of the network. The method was tested for\ndifferent levels of in-plane undersampling for dynamic MRI. The reconstructed\ndynamic SR results after fine-tuning showed higher similarity with the high\nresolution ground-truth, while quantitatively achieving statistically\nsignificant improvement. The average SSIM of the lowest resolution experimented\nduring this research (6.25~\\% of the k-space) before and after fine-tuning were\n0.939 $\\pm$ 0.008 and 0.957 $\\pm$ 0.006 respectively.

For this problem, we propose to adopt a proxy\ndataset that 1) is fully labeled and 2) well reflects the true model rankings\nin a given target environment, and use the performance rankings on the proxy\nsets as surrogates. We first select labeled datasets as the proxy.\nSpecifically, datasets that are more similar to the unlabeled target domain are\nfound to better preserve the relative performance rankings. Motivated by this,\nwe further propose to search the proxy set by sampling images from various\ndatasets that have similar distributions as the target. We analyze the problem\nand its solutions on the person re-identification (re-ID) task, for which\nsufficient datasets are publicly available, and show that a carefully\nconstructed proxy set effectively captures relative performance ranking in new\nenvironments.

          "description": "In recent years Deep Learning reached significant results in many practical\nproblems, such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech\nrecognition and many others. For many years the main goal of the research was\nto improve the quality of models, even if the complexity was impractically\nhigh. However, for the production solutions, which often require real-time\nwork, the latency of the model plays a very important role. Current\nstate-of-the-art architectures are found with neural architecture search (NAS)\ntaking model complexity into account. However, designing of the search space\nsuitable for specific hardware is still a challenging task. To address this\nproblem we propose a measure of hardware efficiency of neural architecture\nsearch space - matrix efficiency measure (MEM); a search space comprising of\nhardware-efficient operations; a latency-aware scaling method; and ISyNet - a\nset of architectures designed to be fast on the specialized neural processing\nunit (NPU) hardware and accurate at the same time. We show the advantage of the\ndesigned architectures for the NPU devices on ImageNet and the generalization\nability for the downstream classification and detection tasks.",

          "description": "Human activity recognition plays an increasingly important role not only in\nour daily lives, but also in the medical and rehabilitation fields. The\ndevelopment of deep learning has also contributed to the advancement of human\nactivity recognition, but the large amount of data annotation work required to\ntrain deep learning models is a major obstacle to the development of human\nactivity recognition. Contrastive learning has started to be used in the field\nof sensor-based human activity recognition due to its ability to avoid the cost\nof labeling large datasets and its ability to better distinguish between sample\nrepresentations of different instances. Among them, data augmentation, an\nimportant part of contrast learning, has a significant impact on model\neffectiveness, but current data augmentation methods do not perform too\nsuccessfully in contrast learning frameworks for wearable sensor-based activity\nrecognition. To optimize the effect of contrast learning models, in this paper,\nwe investigate the sampling frequency of sensors and propose a resampling data\naugmentation method. In addition, we also propose a contrast learning framework\nbased on human activity recognition and apply the resampling augmentation\nmethod to the data augmentation phase of contrast learning. The experimental\nresults show that the resampling augmentation method outperforms supervised\nlearning by 9.88% on UCI HAR and 7.69% on Motion Sensor in the fine-tuning\nevaluation of contrast learning with a small amount of labeled data, and also\nreveal that not all data augmentation methods will have positive effects in the\ncontrast learning framework. Finally, we explored the influence of the\ncombination of different augmentation methods on contrastive learning, and the\nexperimental results showed that the effect of most combination augmentation\nmethods was better than that of single augmentation.",

On\nthe other hand, the recent deployment of facial recognition systems with uneven\npredictive performances on different population segments highlights the\nrepresentativeness issues possibly induced by a naive aggregation of image\ndatasets. Indeed, sampling bias does not vanish simply by considering larger\ndatasets, and ignoring its impact may completely jeopardize the generalization\ncapacity of the learned prediction rules. In this paper, we show how biasing\nmodels, originally introduced for nonparametric estimation in (Gill et al.,\n1988), and recently revisited from the perspective of statistical learning\ntheory in (Laforgue and Cl\\'emen\\c{c}on, 2019), can be applied to remedy these\nproblems in the context of visual recognition. Based on the (approximate)\nknowledge of the biasing mechanisms at work, our approach consists in\nreweighting the observations, so as to form a nearly debiased estimator of the\ntarget distribution. One key condition for our method to be theoretically valid\nis that the supports of the distributions generating the biased datasets at\ndisposal must overlap, and cover the support of the target distribution. In\norder to meet this requirement in practice, we propose to use a low dimensional\nimage representation, shared across the image databases. Finally, we provide\nnumerical experiments highlighting the relevance of our approach whenever the\nbiasing functions are appropriately chosen.",

          "description": "Anomaly detection in computer vision is the task of identifying images which\ndeviate from a set of normal images. A common approach is to train deep\nconvolutional autoencoders to inpaint covered parts of an image and compare the\noutput with the original image. By training on anomaly-free samples only, the\nmodel is assumed to not being able to reconstruct anomalous regions properly.\nFor anomaly detection by inpainting we suggest it to be beneficial to\nincorporate information from potentially distant regions. In particular we pose\nanomaly detection as a patch-inpainting problem and propose to solve it with a\npurely self-attention based approach discarding convolutions. The proposed\nInpainting Transformer (InTra) is trained to inpaint covered patches in a large\nsequence of image patches, thereby integrating information across large regions\nof the input image. When training from scratch, in comparison to other methods\nnot using extra training data, InTra achieves results on par with the current\nstate-of-the-art on the MVTec AD dataset for detection and surpassing them on\nsegmentation.",

          "description": "Hyperspectral image has become increasingly crucial due to its abundant\nspectral information. However, It has poor spatial resolution with the\nlimitation of the current imaging mechanism. Nowadays, many convolutional\nneural networks have been proposed for the hyperspectral image super-resolution\nproblem. However, convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods only\nconsider the local information instead of the global one with the limited\nkernel size of receptive field in the convolution operation. In this paper, we\ndesign a network based on the transformer for fusing the low-resolution\nhyperspectral images and high-resolution multispectral images to obtain the\nhigh-resolution hyperspectral images. Thanks to the representing ability of the\ntransformer, our approach is able to explore the intrinsic relationships of\nfeatures globally. Furthermore, considering the LR-HSIs hold the main spectral\nstructure, the network focuses on the spatial detail estimation releasing from\nthe burden of reconstructing the whole data. It reduces the mapping space of\nthe proposed network, which enhances the final performance.

          "description": "3D human shape and pose estimation is the essential task for human motion\nanalysis, which is widely used in many 3D applications. However, existing\nmethods cannot simultaneously capture the relations at multiple levels,\nincluding spatial-temporal level and human joint level. Therefore they fail to\nmake accurate predictions in some hard scenarios when there is cluttered\nbackground, occlusion, or extreme pose. To this end, we propose Multi-level\nAttention Encoder-Decoder Network (MAED), including a Spatial-Temporal Encoder\n(STE) and a Kinematic Topology Decoder (KTD) to model multi-level attentions in\na unified framework. STE consists of a series of cascaded blocks based on\nMulti-Head Self-Attention, and each block uses two parallel branches to learn\nspatial and temporal attention respectively. Meanwhile, KTD aims at modeling\nthe joint level attention. It regards pose estimation as a top-down\nhierarchical process similar to SMPL kinematic tree. With the training set of\n3DPW, MAED outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 6.2, 7.2, and 2.4\nmm of PA-MPJPE on the three widely used benchmarks 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and\nHuman3.6M respectively.

          "description": "In multi-object detection using neural networks, the fundamental problem is,\n\"How should the network learn a variable number of bounding boxes in different\ninput images?\". Previous methods train a multi-object detection network through\na procedure that directly assigns the ground truth bounding boxes to the\nspecific locations of the network's output. However, this procedure makes the\ntraining of a multi-object detection network too heuristic and complicated. In\nthis paper, we reformulate the multi-object detection task as a problem of\ndensity estimation of bounding boxes. Instead of assigning each ground truth to\nspecific locations of network's output, we train a network by estimating the\nprobability density of bounding boxes in an input image using a mixture model.\nFor this purpose, we propose a novel network for object detection called\nMixture Density Object Detector (MDOD), and the corresponding objective\nfunction for the density-estimation-based training. We applied MDOD to MS COCO\ndataset. Our proposed method not only deals with multi-object detection\nproblems in a new approach, but also improves detection performances through\nMDOD.

Although existing fine-tuning approaches\nsubstantially improve accuracy in-distribution, they also reduce\nout-of-distribution robustness. We address this tension by introducing a simple\nand effective method for improving robustness: ensembling the weights of the\nzero-shot and fine-tuned models. Compared to standard fine-tuning, the\nresulting weight-space ensembles provide large accuracy improvements\nout-of-distribution, while matching or improving in-distribution accuracy. On\nImageNet and five derived distribution shifts, weight-space ensembles improve\nout-of-distribution accuracy by 2 to 10 percentage points while increasing\nin-distribution accuracy by nearly 1 percentage point relative to standard\nfine-tuning.

Given an image and a mask\nspecifying the region to edit, we backpropagate through a state-of-the-art\nsaliency model to parameterize a differentiable editing operator, such that the\nsaliency within the masked region is reduced. We demonstrate several operators,\nincluding: a recoloring operator, which learns to apply a color transform that\ncamouflages and blends distractors into their surroundings; a warping operator,\nwhich warps less salient image regions to cover distractors, gradually\ncollapsing objects into themselves and effectively removing them (an effect\nakin to inpainting); a GAN operator, which uses a semantic prior to fully\nreplace image regions with plausible, less salient alternatives. The resulting\neffects are consistent with cognitive research on the human visual system\n(e.g., since color mismatch is salient, the recoloring operator learns to\nharmonize objects' colors with their surrounding to reduce their saliency),\nand, importantly, are all achieved solely through the guidance of the\npretrained saliency model, with no additional supervision.

          "description": "Super-resolving the Magnetic Resonance (MR) image of a target contrast under\nthe guidance of the corresponding auxiliary contrast, which provides additional\nanatomical information, is a new and effective solution for fast MR imaging.\nHowever, current multi-contrast super-resolution (SR) methods tend to\nconcatenate different contrasts directly, ignoring their relationships in\ndifferent clues, \\eg, in the foreground and background. In this paper, we\npropose a separable attention network (comprising a foreground priority\nattention and background separation attention), named SANet. Our method can\nexplore the foreground and background areas in the forward and reverse\ndirections with the help of the auxiliary contrast, enabling it to learn\nclearer anatomical structures and edge information for the SR of a\ntarget-contrast MR image. SANet provides three appealing benefits: (1) It is\nthe first model to explore a separable attention mechanism that uses the\nauxiliary contrast to predict the foreground and background regions, diverting\nmore attention to refining any uncertain details between these regions and\ncorrecting the fine areas in the reconstructed results. (2) A multi-stage\nintegration module is proposed to learn the response of multi-contrast fusion\nat different stages, obtain the dependency between the fused features, and\nimprove their representation ability. (3) Extensive experiments with various\nstate-of-the-art multi-contrast SR methods on fastMRI and clinical \\textit{in\nvivo} datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model.",

The goal of automating waste-sorting is to replace the\nhuman role of robust detection and agile manipulation of waste items with\nrobots. To achieve this, we propose three methods. First, we provide a combined\nmanipulation method using graspless push-and-drop and pick-and-release\nmanipulation. Second, we provide a robotic system that can automatically\ncollect object images to quickly train a deep neural-network model. Third, we\nprovide a method to mitigate the differences in the appearance of target\nobjects from two scenes: one for dataset collection and the other for waste\nsorting in a recycling factory. If differences exist, the performance of a\ntrained waste detector may decrease. We address differences in illumination and\nbackground by applying object scaling, histogram matching with histogram\nequalization, and background synthesis to the source target-object images. Via\nexperiments in an indoor experimental workplace for waste-sorting, we confirm\nthat the proposed methods enable quick collection of the training image sets\nfor three classes of waste items (i.e., aluminum can, glass bottle, and plastic\nbottle) and detection with higher performance than the methods that do not\nconsider the differences.

          "description": "This paper explores the potential for performing temporal semantic\nsegmentation in the context of agricultural robotics without temporally\nlabelled data. We achieve this by proposing to generate virtual temporal\nsamples from labelled still images. By exploiting the relatively static scene\nand assuming that the robot (camera) moves we are able to generate virtually\nlabelled temporal sequences with no extra annotation effort. Normally, to train\na recurrent neural network (RNN), labelled samples from a video (temporal)\nsequence are required which is laborious and has stymied work in this\ndirection. By generating virtual temporal samples, we demonstrate that it is\npossible to train a lightweight RNN to perform semantic segmentation on two\nchallenging agricultural datasets. Our results show that by training a temporal\nsemantic segmenter using virtual samples we can increase the performance by an\nabsolute amount of $4.6$ and $4.9$ on sweet pepper and sugar beet datasets,\nrespectively. This indicates that our virtual data augmentation technique is\nable to accurately classify agricultural images temporally without the use of\ncomplicated synthetic data generation techniques nor with the overhead of\nlabelling large amounts of temporal sequences.",

          "description": "Vision-and-language (V\\&L) reasoning necessitates perception of visual\nconcepts such as objects and actions, understanding semantics and language\ngrounding, and reasoning about the interplay between the two modalities. One\ncrucial aspect of visual reasoning is spatial understanding, which involves\nunderstanding relative locations of objects, i.e.\\ implicitly learning the\ngeometry of the scene. In this work, we evaluate the faithfulness of V\\&L\nmodels to such geometric understanding, by formulating the prediction of\npair-wise relative locations of objects as a classification as well as a\nregression task. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art transformer-based\nV\\&L models lack sufficient abilities to excel at this task. Motivated by this,\nwe design two objectives as proxies for 3D spatial reasoning (SR) -- object\ncentroid estimation, and relative position estimation, and train V\\&L with weak\nsupervision from off-the-shelf depth estimators. This leads to considerable\nimprovements in accuracy for the \"GQA\" visual question answering challenge (in\nfully supervised, few-shot, and O.O.D settings) as well as improvements in\nrelative spatial reasoning.

In\nthis paper, we present a novel neural scene rendering system, which learns an\nobject-compositional neural radiance field and produces realistic rendering\nwith editing capability for a clustered and real-world scene. Specifically, we\ndesign a novel two-pathway architecture, in which the scene branch encodes the\nscene geometry and appearance, and the object branch encodes each standalone\nobject conditioned on learnable object activation codes. To survive the\ntraining in heavily cluttered scenes, we propose a scene-guided training\nstrategy to solve the 3D space ambiguity in the occluded regions and learn\nsharp boundaries for each object.

The patterns that deep networks have learned\nfrom a training dataset can be grasped by observing the feature variation among\nvarious classes. However, current approaches perform the feature modification\nto increase the classification probability for the target class irrespective of\nthe internal characteristics of deep networks. This often leads to unclear\nexplanations that deviate from real-world data distributions. To address this\nproblem, we propose a counterfactual explanation method that exploits the\nstatistics learned from a training dataset. Especially, we gradually construct\nan explanation by iterating over masking and composition steps. The masking\nstep aims to select an important feature from the input data to be classified\nas a target class. Meanwhile, the composition step aims to optimize the\npreviously selected feature by ensuring that its output score is close to the\nlogit space of the training data that are classified as the target class.\nExperimental results show that our method produces human-friendly\ninterpretations on various classification datasets and verify that such\ninterpretations can be achieved with fewer feature modification.",

As computer vision technology continues to develop, people are no longer\nsatisfied with simply detecting and recognizing objects in images; instead,\npeople look forward to a higher level of understanding and reasoning about\nvisual scenes. For example, given an image, we want to not only detect and\nrecognize objects in the image, but also know the relationship between objects\n(visual relationship detection), and generate a text description (image\ncaptioning) based on the image content. Alternatively, we might want the\nmachine to tell us what the little girl in the image is doing (Visual Question\nAnswering (VQA)), or even remove the dog from the image and find similar images\n(image editing and retrieval), etc. These tasks require a higher level of\nunderstanding and reasoning for image vision tasks. The scene graph is just\nsuch a powerful tool for scene understanding. Therefore, scene graphs have\nattracted the attention of a large number of researchers, and related research\nis often cross-modal, complex, and rapidly developing. However, no relatively\nsystematic survey of scene graphs exists at present. To this end, this survey\nconducts a comprehensive investigation of the current scene graph research.\nMore specifically, we first summarized the general definition of the scene\ngraph, then conducted a comprehensive and systematic discussion on the\ngeneration method of the scene graph (SGG) and the SGG with the aid of prior\nknowledge. We then investigated the main applications of scene graphs and\nsummarized the most commonly used datasets. Finally, we provide some insights\ninto the future development of scene graphs.

          "description": "Misinformation entails the dissemination of falsehoods that leads to the slow\nfracturing of society via decreased trust in democratic processes,\ninstitutions, and science. The public has grown aware of the role of social\nmedia as a superspreader of untrustworthy information, where even pandemics\nhave not been immune. In this paper, we focus on COVID-19 misinformation and\nexamine a subset of 2.1M tweets to understand misinformation as a function of\nengagement, tweet content (COVID-19- vs. non-COVID-19-related), and veracity\n(misleading or factual). Using correlation analysis, we show the most relevant\nfeature subsets among over 126 features that most heavily correlate with\nmisinformation or facts. We found that (i) factual tweets, regardless of\nwhether COVID-related, were more engaging than misinformation tweets; and (ii)\nfeatures that most heavily correlated with engagement varied depending on the\nveracity and content of the tweet.",

          "description": "Epilepsy is one of the most crucial neurological disorders, and its early\ndiagnosis will help the clinicians to provide accurate treatment for the\npatients. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are widely used for epileptic\nseizures detection, which provides specialists with substantial information\nabout the functioning of the brain. In this paper, a novel diagnostic procedure\nusing fuzzy theory and deep learning techniques are introduced. The proposed\nmethod is evaluated on the Bonn University dataset with six classification\ncombinations and also on the Freiburg dataset. The tunable-Q wavelet transform\n(TQWT) is employed to decompose the EEG signals into different sub-bands. In\nthe feature extraction step, 13 different fuzzy entropies are calculated from\ndifferent sub-bands of TQWT, and their computational complexities are\ncalculated to help researchers choose the best feature sets. In the following,\nan autoencoder (AE) with six layers is employed for dimensionality reduction.\nFinally, the standard adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and also\nits variants with grasshopper optimization algorithm (ANFIS-GOA), particle\nswarm optimization (ANFIS-PSO), and breeding swarm optimization (ANFIS-BS)\nmethods are used for classification. Using our proposed method, ANFIS-BS method\nhas obtained an accuracy of 99.74% in classifying into two classes and an\naccuracy of 99.46% in ternary classification on the Bonn dataset and 99.28% on\nthe Freiburg dataset, reaching state-of-the-art performances on both of them.",

          "description": "Training NLP systems typically assumes access to annotated data that has a\nsingle human label per example. Given imperfect labeling from annotators and\ninherent ambiguity of language, we hypothesize that single label is not\nsufficient to learn the spectrum of language interpretation. We explore new\nlabel annotation distribution schemes, assigning multiple labels per example\nfor a small subset of training examples. Introducing such multi label examples\nat the cost of annotating fewer examples brings clear gains on natural language\ninference task and entity typing task, even when we simply first train with a\nsingle label data and then fine tune with multi label examples. Extending a\nMixUp data augmentation framework, we propose a learning algorithm that can\nlearn from uneven training examples (with zero, one, or multiple labels). This\nalgorithm efficiently combines signals from uneven training data and brings\nadditional gains in low annotation budget and cross domain settings. Together,\nour method achieves consistent gains in both accuracy and label distribution\nmetrics in two tasks, suggesting training with uneven training data can be\nbeneficial for many NLP tasks.",

          "description": "Advances in neural recording present increasing opportunities to study neural\nactivity in unprecedented detail. Latent variable models (LVMs) are promising\ntools for analyzing this rich activity across diverse neural systems and\nbehaviors, as LVMs do not depend on known relationships between the activity\nand external experimental variables. However, progress in latent variable\nmodeling is currently impeded by a lack of standardization, resulting in\nmethods being developed and compared in an ad hoc manner. To coordinate these\nmodeling efforts, we introduce a benchmark suite for latent variable modeling\nof neural population activity. We curate four datasets of neural spiking\nactivity from cognitive, sensory, and motor areas to promote models that apply\nto the wide variety of activity seen across these areas. We identify\nunsupervised evaluation as a common framework for evaluating models across\ndatasets, and apply several baselines that demonstrate benchmark diversity.

          "description": "We find that images contain intrinsic structure that enables the reversal of\nmany adversarial attacks. Attack vectors cause not only image classifiers to\nfail, but also collaterally disrupt incidental structure in the image. We\ndemonstrate that modifying the attacked image to restore the natural structure\nwill reverse many types of attacks, providing a defense. Experiments\ndemonstrate significantly improved robustness for several state-of-the-art\nmodels across the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets. Our results\nshow that our defense is still effective even if the attacker is aware of the\ndefense mechanism. Since our defense is deployed during inference instead of\ntraining, it is compatible with pre-trained networks as well as most other\ndefenses.

          "description": "Pretrained Masked Language Models (MLMs) have revolutionised NLP in recent\nyears. However, previous work has indicated that off-the-shelf MLMs are not\neffective as universal lexical or sentence encoders without further\ntask-specific fine-tuning on NLI, sentence similarity, or paraphrasing tasks\nusing annotated task data. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to\nturn MLMs into effective universal lexical and sentence encoders even without\nany additional data and without any supervision. We propose an extremely\nsimple, fast and effective contrastive learning technique, termed Mirror-BERT,\nwhich converts MLMs (e.g., BERT and RoBERTa) into such encoders in 20-30\nseconds without any additional external knowledge. Mirror-BERT relies on fully\nidentical or slightly modified string pairs as positive (i.e., synonymous)\nfine-tuning examples, and aims to maximise their similarity during identity\nfine-tuning. We report huge gains over off-the-shelf MLMs with Mirror-BERT in\nboth lexical-level and sentence-level tasks, across different domains and\ndifferent languages. Notably, in the standard sentence semantic similarity\n(STS) tasks, our self-supervised Mirror-BERT model even matches the performance\nof the task-tuned Sentence-BERT models from prior work. Finally, we delve\ndeeper into the inner workings of MLMs, and suggest some evidence on why this\nsimple approach can yield effective universal lexical and sentence encoders.",

          "description": "We consider machine learning applications that train a model by leveraging\ndata distributed over a trusted network, where communication constraints can\ncreate a performance bottleneck. A number of recent approaches propose to\novercome this bottleneck through compression of gradient updates. However, as\nmodels become larger, so does the size of the gradient updates. In this paper,\nwe propose an alternate approach to learn from distributed data that quantizes\ndata instead of gradients, and can support learning over applications where the\nsize of gradient updates is prohibitive. Our approach leverages the dependency\nof the computed gradient on data samples, which lie in a much smaller space in\norder to perform the quantization in the smaller dimension data space. At the\ncost of an extra gradient computation, the gradient estimate can be refined by\nconveying the difference between the gradient at the quantized data point and\nthe original gradient using a small number of bits. Lastly, in order to save\ncommunication, our approach adds a layer that decides whether to transmit a\nquantized data sample or not based on its importance for learning. We analyze\nthe convergence of the proposed approach for smooth convex and non-convex\nobjective functions and show that we can achieve order optimal convergence\nrates with communication that mostly depends on the data rather than the model\n(gradient) dimension. We use our proposed algorithm to train ResNet models on\nthe CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, and show that we can achieve an order of\nmagnitude savings over gradient compression methods. These communication\nsavings come at the cost of increasing computation at the learning agent, and\nthus our approach is beneficial in scenarios where communication load is the\nmain problem.",

          "description": "Most recent semantic segmentation methods adopt a U-Net framework with an\nencoder-decoder architecture. It is still challenging for U-Net with a simple\nskip connection scheme to model the global multi-scale context: 1) Not each\nskip connection setting is effective due to the issue of incompatible feature\nsets of encoder and decoder stage, even some skip connection negatively\ninfluence the segmentation performance; 2) The original U-Net is worse than the\none without any skip connection on some datasets. Based on our findings, we\npropose a new segmentation framework, named UCTransNet (with a proposed CTrans\nmodule in U-Net), from the channel perspective with attention mechanism.\nSpecifically, the CTrans module is an alternate of the U-Net skip connections,\nwhich consists of a sub-module to conduct the multi-scale Channel Cross fusion\nwith Transformer (named CCT) and a sub-module Channel-wise Cross-Attention\n(named CCA) to guide the fused multi-scale channel-wise information to\neffectively connect to the decoder features for eliminating the ambiguity.\nHence, the proposed connection consisting of the CCT and CCA is able to replace\nthe original skip connection to solve the semantic gaps for an accurate\nautomatic medical image segmentation. The experimental results suggest that our\nUCTransNet produces more precise segmentation performance and achieves\nconsistent improvements over the state-of-the-art for semantic segmentation\nacross different datasets and conventional architectures involving transformer\nor U-shaped framework.

          "description": "Deep learning has the potential to augment many components of the clinical\nworkflow, such as medical image interpretation. However, the translation of\nthese black box algorithms into clinical practice has been marred by the\nrelative lack of transparency compared to conventional machine learning\nmethods, hindering in clinician trust in the systems for critical medical\ndecision-making. Specifically, common deep learning approaches do not have\nintuitive ways of expressing uncertainty with respect to cases that might\nrequire further human review. Furthermore, the possibility of algorithmic bias\nhas caused hesitancy regarding the use of developed algorithms in clinical\nsettings. To these ends, we explore how conformal methods can complement deep\nlearning models by providing both clinically intuitive way (by means of\nconfidence prediction sets) of expressing model uncertainty as well as\nfacilitating model transparency in clinical workflows. In this paper, we\nconduct a field survey with clinicians to assess clinical use-cases of\nconformal predictions. Next, we conduct experiments with a mammographic breast\ndensity and dermatology photography datasets to demonstrate the utility of\nconformal predictions in \"rule-in\" and \"rule-out\" disease scenarios. Further,\nwe show that conformal predictors can be used to equalize coverage with respect\nto patient demographics such as race and skin tone. We find that a conformal\npredictions to be a promising framework with potential to increase clinical\nusability and transparency for better collaboration between deep learning\nalgorithms and clinicians.",

          "description": "Correctly capturing intraoperative brain shift in image-guided neurosurgical\nprocedures is a critical task for aligning preoperative data with\nintraoperative geometry, ensuring effective surgical navigation and optimal\nsurgical precision. While the finite element method (FEM) is a proven technique\nto effectively approximate soft tissue deformation through biomechanical\nformulations, their degree of success boils down to a trade-off between\naccuracy and speed. To circumvent this problem, the most recent works in this\ndomain have proposed leveraging data-driven models obtained by training various\nmachine learning algorithms, e.g. random forests, artificial neural networks\n(ANNs), with the results of finite element analysis (FEA) to speed up tissue\ndeformation approximations by prediction. These methods, however, do not\naccount for the structure of the finite element (FE) mesh during training that\nprovides information on node connectivities as well as the distance between\nthem, which can aid with approximating tissue deformation based on the\nproximity of force load points with the rest of the mesh nodes. Therefore, this\nwork proposes a novel framework, PhysGNN, a data-driven model that approximates\nthe solution of FEA by leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs), which are\ncapable of accounting for the mesh structural information and inductive\nlearning over unstructured grids and complex topological structures.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate that the proposed architecture, PhysGNN, promises\naccurate and fast soft tissue deformation approximations while remaining\ncomputationally feasible, suitable for neurosurgical settings.",

In addition to providing a risk score, the Risk Advisor\ndecomposes the uncertainty estimates into aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty\ncomponents, thus giving informative insights into the sources of uncertainty\ninducing the failures.

In this paper, we provide\nprecisely such an information-theoretic analysis of such tradeoffs under both\nclassification and regression settings. We provide a geometric characterization\nof the accuracy and invariance achievable by any representation of the data; we\nterm this feasible region the information plane. We provide a lower bound for\nthis feasible region for the classification case, and an exact characterization\nfor the regression case, which allows us to either bound or exactly\ncharacterize the Pareto optimal frontier between accuracy and invariance.\nAlthough our contributions are mainly theoretical, a key practical application\nof our results is in certifying the potential sub-optimality of any given\nrepresentation learning algorithm for either classification or regression\ntasks.

The idea is to optimally allocate the resources among the\ngroup of agents by minimizing the overall cost function subject to fixed sum of\nresources. Each agents' information is restricted to its own state and cost\nfunction and those of its immediate in-neighbors. This is motivated by\ndistributed applications such as mobile edge-computing, economic dispatch over\nsmart grids, and multi-agent coverage control. This work provides a fast\nconvergent solution (in comparison with linear dynamics) while considering\nrelaxed network connectivity with quantized communication links.

          "description": "Deep neural networks such as AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold predict remarkably\naccurate structures of proteins compared to other algorithmic approaches. It is\nknown that biologically small perturbations in the protein sequence do not lead\nto drastic changes in the protein structure. In this paper, we demonstrate that\nRoseTTAFold does not exhibit such a robustness despite its high accuracy, and\nbiologically small perturbations for some input sequences result in radically\ndifferent predicted protein structures. This raises the challenge of detecting\nwhen these predicted protein structures cannot be trusted. We define the\nrobustness measure for the predicted structure of a protein sequence to be the\ninverse of the root-mean-square distance (RMSD) in the predicted structure and\nthe structure of its adversarially perturbed sequence. We use adversarial\nattack methods to create adversarial protein sequences, and show that the RMSD\nin the predicted protein structure ranges from 0.119\\r{A} to 34.162\\r{A} when\nthe adversarial perturbations are bounded by 20 units in the BLOSUM62 distance.\nThis demonstrates very high variance in the robustness measure of the predicted\nstructures. We show that the magnitude of the correlation (0.917) between our\nrobustness measure and the RMSD between the predicted structure and the ground\ntruth is high, that is, the predictions with low robustness measure cannot be\ntrusted. This is the first paper demonstrating the susceptibility of\nRoseTTAFold to adversarial attacks.",

          "description": "In recent years, many non-traditional classification methods, such as Random\nForest, Boosting, and neural network, have been widely used in applications.\nTheir performance is typically measured in terms of classification accuracy.\nWhile the classification error rate and the like are important, they do not\naddress a fundamental question: Is the classification method underfitted? To\nour best knowledge, there is no existing method that can assess the\ngoodness-of-fit of a general classification procedure. Indeed, the lack of a\nparametric assumption makes it challenging to construct proper tests. To\novercome this difficulty, we propose a methodology called BAGofT that splits\nthe data into a training set and a validation set. First, the classification\nprocedure to assess is applied to the training set, which is also used to\nadaptively find a data grouping that reveals the most severe regions of\nunderfitting. Then, based on this grouping, we calculate a test statistic by\ncomparing the estimated success probabilities and the actual observed responses\nfrom the validation set. The data splitting guarantees that the size of the\ntest is controlled under the null hypothesis, and the power of the test goes to\none as the sample size increases under the alternative hypothesis. For testing\nparametric classification models, the BAGofT has a broader scope than the\nexisting methods since it is not restricted to specific parametric models\n(e.g., logistic regression). Extensive simulation studies show the utility of\nthe BAGofT when assessing general classification procedures and its strengths\nover some existing methods when testing parametric classification models.",

We present KnowledgeEditor, a\nmethod which can be used to edit this knowledge and, thus, fix 'bugs' or\nunexpected predictions without the need for expensive re-training or\nfine-tuning. Besides being computationally efficient, KnowledgeEditordoes not\nrequire any modifications in LM pre-training (e.g., the use of meta-learning).\nIn our approach, we train a hyper-network with constrained optimization to\nmodify a fact without affecting the rest of the knowledge; the trained\nhyper-network is then used to predict the weight update at test time. We show\nKnowledgeEditor's efficacy with two popular architectures and\nknowledge-intensive tasks: i) a BERT model fine-tuned for fact-checking, and\nii) a sequence-to-sequence BART model for question answering. With our method,\nchanging a prediction on the specific wording of a query tends to result in a\nconsistent change in predictions also for its paraphrases. We show that this\ncan be further encouraged by exploiting (e.g., automatically-generated)\nparaphrases during training.

However,\nexisting blind denoising methods still require the assumption with regard to\nnoise characteristics, such as zero-mean noise distribution and pixel-wise\nnoise-signal independence; this hinders wide adaptation of the method in the\nmedical domain. On the other hand, unpaired learning can overcome limitations\nrelated to the assumption on noise characteristics, which makes it more\nfeasible for collecting the training data in real-world scenarios.

Unlike the\nexisting unpaired image denoising methods relying on matching data\ndistributions in different domains, the two architectures in ISCL, designed for\ndifferent tasks, complement each other and boost the learning process.

          "description": "In a ride-hailing system, an optimal relocation of vacant vehicles can\nsignificantly reduce fleet idling time and balance the supply-demand\ndistribution, enhancing system efficiency and promoting driver satisfaction and\nretention. Model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been shown to\ndynamically learn the relocating policy by actively interacting with the\nintrinsic dynamics in large-scale ride-hailing systems. However, the issues of\nsparse reward signals and unbalanced demand and supply distribution place\ncritical barriers in developing effective DRL models. Conventional exploration\nstrategy (e.g., the $\\epsilon$-greedy) may barely work under such an\nenvironment because of dithering in low-demand regions distant from\nhigh-revenue regions. This study proposes the deep relocating option policy\n(DROP) that supervises vehicle agents to escape from oversupply areas and\neffectively relocate to potentially underserved areas. We propose to learn the\nLaplacian embedding of a time-expanded relocation graph, as an approximation\nrepresentation of the system relocation policy. The embedding generates\ntask-agnostic signals, which in combination with task-dependent signals,\nconstitute the pseudo-reward function for generating DROPs. We present a\nhierarchical learning framework that trains a high-level relocation policy and\na set of low-level DROPs. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated\nusing a custom-built high-fidelity simulator with real-world trip record data.\nWe report that DROP significantly improves baseline models with 15.7% more\nhourly revenue and can effectively resolve the dithering issue in low-demand\nareas.",

          "description": "We consider a new kind of clustering problem in which clusters need not be\nindependent of each other, but rather can have compositional relationships with\nother clusters (e.g., an image set consists of rectangles, circles, as well as\ncombinations of rectangles and circles). This task is motivated by recent work\nin few-shot learning on compositional embedding models that structure the\nembedding space to distinguish the label sets, not just the individual labels,\nassigned to the examples. To tackle this clustering problem, we propose a new\nalgorithm called Compositional Affinity Propagation (CAP). In contrast to\nstandard Affinity Propagation as well as other algorithms for multi-view and\nhierarchical clustering, CAP can deduce compositionality among clusters\nautomatically. We show promising results, compared to several existing\nclustering algorithms, on the MultiMNIST, OmniGlot, and LibriSpeech datasets.\nOur work has applications to multi-object image recognition and speaker\ndiarization with simultaneous speech from multiple speakers.",

Upper bounds on these rates have been established for\nsigmoidal and ReLU activation functions, but it has remained an important open\nproblem whether these rates are sharp. In this article, we provide a solution\nto this problem by proving sharp lower bounds on the approximation rates for\nshallow neural networks, which are obtained by lower bounding the $L^2$-metric\nentropy of the convex hull of the neural network basis functions. In addition,\nour methods also give sharp lower bounds on the Kolmogorov $n$-widths of this\nconvex hull, which show that the variation spaces corresponding to shallow\nneural networks cannot be efficiently approximated by linear methods. These\nlower bounds apply to both sigmoidal activation functions with bounded\nvariation and to activation functions which are a power of the ReLU. Our\nresults also quantify how much stronger the Barron spectral norm is than the\nvariation norm and, combined with previous results, give the asymptotics of the\n$L^\\infty$-metric entropy up to logarithmic factors in the case of the ReLU\nactivation function.",

          "description": "Like many scientific fields, new chemistry literature has grown at a\nstaggering pace, with thousands of papers released every month. A large portion\nof chemistry literature focuses on new molecules and reactions between\nmolecules. Most vital information is conveyed through 2-D images of molecules,\nrepresenting the underlying molecules or reactions described. In order to\nensure reproducible and machine-readable molecule representations, text-based\nmolecule descriptors like SMILES and SELFIES were created. These text-based\nmolecule representations provide molecule generation but are unfortunately\nrarely present in published literature. In the absence of molecule descriptors,\nthe generation of molecule descriptors from the 2-D images present in the\nliterature is necessary to understand chemistry literature at scale. Successful\nmethods such as Optical Structure Recognition Application (OSRA), and\nChemSchematicResolver are able to extract the locations of molecules structures\nin chemistry papers and infer molecular descriptions and reactions. While\neffective, existing systems expect chemists to correct outputs, making them\nunsuitable for unsupervised large-scale data mining. Leveraging the task\nformulation of image captioning introduced by DECIMER, we introduce IMG2SMI, a\nmodel which leverages Deep Residual Networks for image feature extraction and\nan encoder-decoder Transformer layers for molecule description generation.\nUnlike previous Neural Network-based systems, IMG2SMI builds around the task of\nmolecule description generation, which enables IMG2SMI to outperform OSRA-based\nsystems by 163% in molecule similarity prediction as measured by the molecular\nMACCS Fingerprint Tanimoto Similarity. Additionally, to facilitate further\nresearch on this task, we release a new molecule prediction dataset. including\n81 million molecules for molecule description generation",

          "description": "Automated segmentation of human cardiac magnetic resonance datasets has been\nsteadily improving during recent years.

          "description": "A wide range of code intelligence (CI) tools, powered by deep neural\nnetworks, have been developed recently to improve programming productivity and\nperform program analysis. To reliably use such tools, developers often need to\nreason about the behavior of the underlying models and the factors that affect\nthem. This is especially challenging for tools backed by deep neural networks.\nVarious methods have tried to reduce this opacity in the vein of\n\"transparent/interpretable-AI\". However, these approaches are often specific to\na particular set of network architectures, even requiring access to the\nnetwork's parameters. This makes them difficult to use for the average\nprogrammer, which hinders the reliable adoption of neural CI systems. In this\npaper, we propose a simple, model-agnostic approach to identify critical input\nfeatures for models in CI systems, by drawing on software debugging research,\nspecifically delta debugging. Our approach, SIVAND, uses simplification\ntechniques that reduce the size of input programs of a CI model while\npreserving the predictions of the model. We show that this approach yields\nremarkably small outputs and is broadly applicable across many model\narchitectures and problem domains. We find that the models in our experiments\noften rely heavily on just a few syntactic features in input programs. We\nbelieve that SIVAND's extracted features may help understand neural CI systems'\npredictions and learned behavior.",

          "description": "Recently equal risk pricing, a framework for fair derivative pricing, was\nextended to consider dynamic risk measures. However, all current\nimplementations either employ a static risk measure that violates time\nconsistency, or are based on traditional dynamic programming solution schemes\nthat are impracticable in problems with a large number of underlying assets\n(due to the curse of dimensionality) or with incomplete asset dynamics\ninformation. In this paper, we extend for the first time a famous off-policy\ndeterministic actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (ACRL) algorithm to the\nproblem of solving a risk averse Markov decision process that models risk using\na time consistent recursive expectile risk measure. This new ACRL algorithm\nallows us to identify high quality time consistent hedging policies (and equal\nrisk prices) for options, such as basket options, that cannot be handled using\ntraditional methods, or in context where only historical trajectories of the\nunderlying assets are available. Our numerical experiments, which involve both\na simple vanilla option and a more exotic basket option, confirm that the new\nACRL algorithm can produce 1) in simple environments, nearly optimal hedging\npolicies, and highly accurate prices, simultaneously for a range of maturities\n2) in complex environments, good quality policies and prices using reasonable\namount of computing resources; and 3) overall, hedging strategies that actually\noutperform the strategies produced using static risk measures when the risk is\nevaluated at later points of time.",

          "description": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance in many graph-based applications. Despite the high expressive\npower, they typically need to perform an expensive recursive neighborhood\nexpansion in multiple training epochs and face a scalability issue. Moreover,\nmost of them are inflexible since they are restricted to fixed-hop\nneighborhoods and insensitive to actual receptive field demands for different\nnodes. We circumvent these limitations by introducing a scalable and flexible\nGraph Attention Multilayer Perceptron (GAMLP). With the separation of the\nnon-linear transformation and feature propagation, GAMLP significantly improves\nthe scalability and efficiency by performing the propagation procedure in a\npre-compute manner. With three principled receptive field attention, each node\nin GAMLP is flexible and adaptive in leveraging the propagated features over\nthe different sizes of reception field. We conduct extensive evaluations on the\nthree large open graph benchmarks (e.g., ogbn-papers100M, ogbn-products and\nogbn-mag), demonstrating that GAMLP not only achieves the state-of-art\nperformance, but also additionally provide high scalability and efficiency.",

          "description": "Partial orders and directed acyclic graphs are commonly recurring data\nstructures that arise naturally in numerous domains and applications and are\nused to represent ordered relations between entities in the domains. Examples\nare task dependencies in a project plan, transaction order in distributed\nledgers and execution sequences of tasks in computer programs, just to mention\na few. We study the problem of order preserving hierarchical clustering of this\nkind of ordered data. That is, if we have $a < b$ in the original data and\ndenote their respective clusters by $[a]$ and $[b]$, then we shall have $[a] <\n[b]$ in the produced clustering. The clustering is similarity based and uses\nstandard linkage functions, such as single- and complete linkage, and is an\nextension of classical hierarchical clustering.\n\nTo achieve this, we define the output from running classical hierarchical\nclustering on strictly ordered data to be partial dendrograms; sub-trees of\nclassical dendrograms with several connected components. We then construct an\nembedding of partial dendrograms over a set into the family of ultrametrics\nover the same set. An optimal hierarchical clustering is defined as the partial\ndendrogram corresponding to the ultrametric closest to the original\ndissimilarity measure, measured in the p-norm. Thus, the method is a\ncombination of classical hierarchical clustering and ultrametric fitting.\n\nA reference implementation is employed for experiments on both synthetic\nrandom data and real world data from a database of machine parts. When compared\nto existing methods, the experiments show that our method excels both in\ncluster quality and order preservation.",

It is difficult to deploy such\ndeep networks on devices with limited resources, like smart wearables,\ncellphones, drones, and autonomous vehicles. Low bit quantization such as\nbinary and ternary quantization is a common approach to alleviate this resource\nrequirements. Ternary quantization provides a more flexible model and\noutperforms binary quantization in terms of accuracy, however doubles the\nmemory footprint and increases the computational cost. Contrary to these\napproaches, mixed quantized models allow a trade-off between accuracy and\nmemory footprint. In such models, quantization depth is often chosen manually,\nor is tuned using a separate optimization routine. The latter requires training\na quantized network multiple times. Here, we propose an adaptive combination of\nbinary and ternary quantization, namely Smart Quantization (SQ), in which the\nquantization depth is modified directly via a regularization function, so that\nthe model is trained only once. Our experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod adapts quantization depth successfully while keeping the model accuracy\nhigh on MNIST and CIFAR10 benchmarks.",

There are many different methods for the motor imagery\nclassification, but the limited understanding on human brain requires more\neffective methods for extracting the features of EEG data. Graph neural\nnetworks(GNNs) have demonstrated its effectiveness in classifying graph\nstructures; and the use of GNN provides new possibilities for brain structure\nconnection feature extraction. In this paper we propose a novel graph neural\nnetwork based on the mutual information of the raw EEG channels called\nMutualGraphNet. We use the mutual information as the adjacency matrix combined\nwith the spatial temporal graph convolution network(ST-GCN) could extract the\ntransition rules of the motor imagery electroencephalogram(EEG) channels data\nmore effectively.

To tackle this\nproblem, we present Off-Policy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (OPIRL), which\n(1) adopts off-policy data distribution instead of on-policy and enables\nsignificant reduction of the number of interactions with the environment, (2)\nlearns a stationary reward function that is transferable with high\ngeneralization capabilities on changing dynamics, and (3) leverages\nmode-covering behavior for faster convergence. We demonstrate that our method\nis considerably more sample efficient and generalizes to novel environments\nthrough the experiments.

To derive a robust optimization model, a\ncentral ingredient is to identify a suitable model for uncertainty, which is\ncalled the uncertainty set. An ongoing challenge in the recent literature is to\nderive uncertainty sets from given historical data that result in solutions\nthat are robust regarding future scenarios. In this paper we use an\nunsupervised deep learning method to learn and extract hidden structures from\ndata, leading to non-convex uncertainty sets and better robust solutions. We\nprove that most of the classical uncertainty classes are special cases of our\nderived sets and that optimizing over them is strongly NP-hard. Nevertheless,\nwe show that the trained neural networks can be integrated into a robust\noptimization model by formulating the adversarial problem as a convex quadratic\nmixed-integer program. This allows us to derive robust solutions through an\niterative scenario generation process. In our computational experiments, we\ncompare this approach to a similar approach using kernel-based support vector\nclustering. We find that uncertainty sets derived by the unsupervised deep\nlearning method find a better description of data and lead to robust solutions\nthat outperform the comparison method both with respect to objective value and\nfeasibility.",

A major obstacle is the unknown alignment of graphs, as well as\nthe lack of accurate and inexpensive comparison metrics. In this work we\nintroduce the filter graph distance. It is an optimal transport based distance\nwhich drives graph comparison through the probability distribution of filtered\ngraph signals. This creates a highly flexible distance, capable of prioritising\ndifferent spectral information in observed graphs, offering a wide range of\nchoices for a comparison metric. We tackle the problem of graph alignment by\ncomputing graph permutations that minimise our new filter distances, which\nimplicitly solves the graph comparison problem. We then propose a new\napproximate cost function that circumvents many computational difficulties\ninherent to graph comparison and permits the exploitation of fast algorithms\nsuch as mirror gradient descent, without grossly sacrificing the performance.\nWe finally propose a novel algorithm derived from a stochastic version of\nmirror gradient descent, which accommodates the non-convexity of the alignment\nproblem, offering a good trade-off between performance accuracy and speed. The\nexperiments on graph alignment and classification show that the flexibility\ngained through filter graph distances can have a significant impact on\nperformance, while the difference in speed offered by the approximation cost\nmakes the framework applicable in practical settings.",

          "description": "This work presents a sparse-attention Transformer architecture for modeling\ndocuments that contain large tables. Tables are ubiquitous on the web, and are\nrich in information. However, more than 20% of relational tables on the web\nhave 20 or more rows (Cafarella et al., 2008), and these large tables present a\nchallenge for current Transformer models, which are typically limited to 512\ntokens. Here we propose MATE, a novel Transformer architecture designed to\nmodel the structure of web tables. MATE uses sparse attention in a way that\nallows heads to efficiently attend to either rows or columns in a table. This\narchitecture scales linearly with respect to speed and memory, and can handle\ndocuments containing more than 8000 tokens with current accelerators. MATE also\nhas a more appropriate inductive bias for tabular data, and sets a new\nstate-of-the-art for three table reasoning datasets. For HybridQA (Chen et al.,\n2020b), a dataset that involves large documents containing tables, we improve\nthe best prior result by 19 points.",

          "description": "Transfer learning has fundamentally changed the landscape of natural language\nprocessing (NLP) research. Many existing state-of-the-art models are first\npre-trained on a large text corpus and then fine-tuned on downstream tasks.\nHowever, due to limited data resources from downstream tasks and the extremely\nlarge capacity of pre-trained models, aggressive fine-tuning often causes the\nadapted model to overfit the data of downstream tasks and forget the knowledge\nof the pre-trained model. To address the above issue in a more principled\nmanner, we propose a new computational framework for robust and efficient\nfine-tuning for pre-trained language models. Specifically, our proposed\nframework contains two important ingredients: 1. Smoothness-inducing\nregularization, which effectively manages the capacity of the model; 2. Bregman\nproximal point optimization, which is a class of trust-region methods and can\nprevent knowledge forgetting. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed\nmethod achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multiple NLP benchmarks.",

          "description": "Deciding on the unimodality of a dataset is an important problem in data\nanalysis and statistical modeling. It allows to obtain knowledge about the\nstructure of the dataset, ie. whether data points have been generated by a\nprobability distribution with a single or more than one peaks. Such knowledge\nis very useful for several data analysis problems, such as for deciding on the\nnumber of clusters and determining unimodal projections. We propose a technique\ncalled UU-test (Unimodal Uniform test) to decide on the unimodality of a\none-dimensional dataset. The method operates on the empirical cumulative\ndensity function (ecdf) of the dataset. It attempts to build a piecewise linear\napproximation of the ecdf that is unimodal and models the data sufficiently in\nthe sense that the data corresponding to each linear segment follows the\nuniform distribution. A unique feature of this approach is that in the case of\nunimodality, it also provides a statistical model of the data in the form of a\nUniform Mixture Model. We present experimental results in order to assess the\nability of the method to decide on unimodality and perform comparisons with the\nwell-known dip-test approach. In addition, in the case of unimodal datasets we\nevaluate the Uniform Mixture Models provided by the proposed method using the\ntest set log-likelihood and the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test.",

          "description": "Many machine learning and data science tasks require solving non-convex\noptimization problems. When the loss function is a sum of multiple terms, a\npopular method is the stochastic gradient descent. Viewed as a process for\nsampling the loss function landscape, the stochastic gradient descent is known\nto prefer flat minima. Though this is desired for certain optimization problems\nsuch as in deep learning, it causes issues when the goal is to find the global\nminimum, especially if the global minimum resides in a sharp valley.\n\nIllustrated with a simple motivating example, we show that the fundamental\nreason is that the difference in the Lipschitz constants of multiple terms in\nthe loss function causes stochastic gradient descent to experience different\nvariances at different minima. In order to mitigate this effect and perform\nfaithful optimization, we propose a combined resampling-reweighting scheme to\nbalance the variance at local minima and extend to general loss functions. We\nexplain from the numerical stability perspective how the proposed scheme is\nmore likely to select the true global minimum, and the local convergence\nanalysis perspective how it converges to a minimum faster when compared with\nthe vanilla stochastic gradient descent. Experiments from robust statistics and\ncomputational chemistry are provided to demonstrate the theoretical findings.",

          "description": "Constructing adversarial perturbations for deep neural networks is an\nimportant direction of research. Crafting image-dependent adversarial\nperturbations using white-box feedback has hitherto been the norm for such\nadversarial attacks. However, black-box attacks are much more practical for\nreal-world applications. Universal perturbations applicable across multiple\nimages are gaining popularity due to their innate generalizability. There have\nalso been efforts to restrict the perturbations to a few pixels in the image.\nThis helps to retain visual similarity with the original images making such\nattacks hard to detect. This paper marks an important step which combines all\nthese directions of research. We propose the DEceit algorithm for constructing\neffective universal pixel-restricted perturbations using only black-box\nfeedback from the target network. We conduct empirical investigations using the\nImageNet validation set on the state-of-the-art deep neural classifiers by\nvarying the number of pixels to be perturbed from a meagre 10 pixels to as high\nas all pixels in the image. We find that perturbing only about 10% of the\npixels in an image using DEceit achieves a commendable and highly transferable\nFooling Rate while retaining the visual quality. We further demonstrate that\nDEceit can be successfully applied to image dependent attacks as well. In both\nsets of experiments, we outperformed several state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) has shown a useful approach to produce a\nbrain-computer interface (BCI). One-dimensional (1-D) EEG signal is yet easily\ndisturbed by certain artifacts (a.k.a. noise) due to the high temporal\nresolution. Thus, it is crucial to remove the noise in received EEG signal.\nRecently, deep learning-based EEG signal denoising approaches have achieved\nimpressive performance compared with traditional ones. It is well known that\nthe characteristics of self-similarity (including non-local and local ones) of\ndata (e.g., natural images and time-domain signals) are widely leveraged for\ndenoising. However, existing deep learning-based EEG signal denoising methods\nignore either the non-local self-similarity (e.g., 1-D convolutional neural\nnetwork) or local one (e.g., fully connected network and recurrent neural\nnetwork). To address this issue, we propose a novel 1-D EEG signal denoising\nnetwork with 2-D transformer, namely EEGDnet. Specifically, we comprehensively\ntake into account the non-local and local self-similarity of EEG signal through\nthe transformer module. By fusing non-local self-similarity in self-attention\nblocks and local self-similarity in feed forward blocks, the negative impact\ncaused by noises and outliers can be reduced significantly. Extensive\nexperiments show that, compared with other state-of-the-art models, EEGDnet\nachieves much better performance in terms of both quantitative and qualitative\nmetrics.",

In this paper, we establish the fundamental factors\nthat cause non-determinism in ML systems. A framework, ReproduceML, is then\nintroduced for deterministic evaluation of ML experiments in a real, controlled\nenvironment.

Using ReproduceML, we run a\ncase study: investigation of the impact of bugs inside ML libraries on\nperformance of ML experiments. This study attempts to quantify the impact that\nthe occurrence of bugs in a popular ML framework, PyTorch, has on the\nperformance of trained models. To do so, a comprehensive methodology is\nproposed to collect buggy versions of ML libraries and run deterministic ML\nexperiments using ReproduceML. Our initial finding is that there is no evidence\nbased on our limited dataset to show that bugs which occurred in PyTorch do\naffect the performance of trained models.

Real-time operation of the reservoir based on\nforecasts of inflows can lead to substantial economic gains. However, the\nforecast of inflow is an intricate task as it has to incorporate the impacts of\nclimate and hydrological changes. Therefore, the major objective of the present\nwork is to develop a novel approach based on long short-term memory (LSTM) for\nthe forecast of inflows. Real-time inflow forecast, in other words, daily\ninflow at the reservoir helps in efficient operation of water resources. Also,\ndaily variations in the release can be monitored efficiently and the\nreliability of operation is improved. This work proposes a naive anomaly\ndetection algorithm baseline based on LSTM. In other words, a strong baseline\nto forecast flood and drought for any deep learning-based prediction model. The\npracticality of the approach has been demonstrated using the observed daily\ndata of the past 20 years from Bhakra Dam in India. The results of the\nsimulations conducted herein clearly indicate the supremacy of the LSTM\napproach over the traditional methods of forecasting. Although, experiments are\nrun on data from Bhakra Dam Reservoir in India, LSTM model, and anomaly\ndetection algorithm are general purpose and can be applied to any basin with\nminimal changes.

We use an image-text matching task to train a\nfeature extractor and then fine-tune it in a transfer learning setting for a\nsupervised task using a small labeled dataset. The end result is a neural\nnetwork that automatically interprets imagery without requiring textual reports\nduring inference.

In non-federated settings, adaptive\noptimization methods have had notable success in combating such issues. In this\nwork, we propose federated versions of adaptive optimizers, including Adagrad,\nAdam, and Yogi, and analyze their convergence in the presence of heterogeneous\ndata for general non-convex settings. Our results highlight the interplay\nbetween client heterogeneity and communication efficiency. We also perform\nextensive experiments on these methods and show that the use of adaptive\noptimizers can significantly improve the performance of federated learning.",

We introduce two main tools for estimating the metric entropy,\napproximation rates, and $n$-widths of these spaces. First, we introduce the\nnotion of a smoothly parameterized dictionary and give upper bounds on the\nnon-linear approximation rates, metric entropy and $n$-widths of their absolute\nconvex hull. The upper bounds depend upon the order of smoothness of the\nparameterization. This result is applied to dictionaries of ridge functions\ncorresponding to shallow neural networks, and they improve upon existing\nresults in many cases. Next, we provide a method for lower bounding the metric\nentropy and $n$-widths of variation spaces which contain certain classes of\nridge functions. This result gives sharp lower bounds on the\n$L^2$-approximation rates, metric entropy, and $n$-widths for variation spaces\ncorresponding to neural networks with a range of important activation\nfunctions, including ReLU$^k$, sigmoidal activation functions with bounded\nvariation, and the B-spline activation functions.",

          "description": "Recently, the textual adversarial attack models become increasingly popular\ndue to their successful in estimating the robustness of NLP models. However,\nexisting works have obvious deficiencies. (1) They usually consider only a\nsingle granularity of modification strategies (e.g. word-level or\nsentence-level), which is insufficient to explore the holistic textual space\nfor generation; (2) They need to query victim models hundreds of times to make\na successful attack, which is highly inefficient in practice. To address such\nproblems, in this paper we propose MAYA, a Multi-grAnularitY Attack model to\neffectively generate high-quality adversarial samples with fewer queries to\nvictim models. Furthermore, we propose a reinforcement-learning based method to\ntrain a multi-granularity attack agent through behavior cloning with the expert\nknowledge from our MAYA algorithm to further reduce the query times.\nAdditionally, we also adapt the agent to attack black-box models that only\noutput labels without confidence scores. We conduct comprehensive experiments\nto evaluate our attack models by attacking BiLSTM, BERT and RoBERTa in two\ndifferent black-box attack settings and three benchmark datasets. Experimental\nresults show that our models achieve overall better attacking performance and\nproduce more fluent and grammatical adversarial samples compared to baseline\nmodels. Besides, our adversarial attack agent significantly reduces the query\ntimes in both attack settings. Our codes are released at\nhttps://github.com/Yangyi-Chen/MAYA.",

In this paper, we aim to the\naddress of the problem of few shot task learning by exploiting and transferring\nfrom a different task which admits a related but disparate label space.\nSpecifically, we devise a label transfer network (LTN) to transform the labels\nfrom source task to the target task of interest for training.

MetaXT offers a principled solution to best\nadapt a pre-trained language model to the target task by transferring knowledge\nfrom the source task.

          "description": "In recent years, deep-learning-based speech emotion recognition models have\noutperformed classical machine learning models. Previously, neural network\ndesigns, such as Multitask Learning, have accounted for variations in emotional\nexpressions due to demographic and contextual factors. However, existing models\nface a few constraints: 1) they rely on a clear definition of domains (e.g.\ngender, noise condition, etc.) and the availability of domain labels; 2) they\noften attempt to learn domain-invariant features while emotion expressions can\nbe domain-specific. In the present study, we propose the Nonparametric\nHierarchical Neural Network (NHNN), a lightweight hierarchical neural network\nmodel based on Bayesian nonparametric clustering. In comparison to Multitask\nLearning approaches, the proposed model does not require domain/task labels. In\nour experiments, the NHNN models generally outperform the models with similar\nlevels of complexity and state-of-the-art models in within-corpus and\ncross-corpus tests. Through clustering analysis, we show that the NHNN models\nare able to learn group-specific features and bridge the performance gap\nbetween groups.",

          "description": "Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm that trains a\nglobal model for prediction based on a number of local models at clients while\nlocal data privacy is preserved. Class imbalance is believed to be one of the\nfactors that degrades the global model performance. However, there has been\nvery little research on if and how class imbalance can affect the global\nperformance. class imbalance in federated learning is much more complex than\nthat in traditional non-distributed machine learning, due to different class\nimbalance situations at local clients. Class imbalance needs to be re-defined\nin distributed learning environments. In this paper, first, we propose two new\nmetrics to define class imbalance -- the global class imbalance degree (MID)\nand the local difference of class imbalance among clients (WCS). Then, we\nconduct extensive experiments to analyze the impact of class imbalance on the\nglobal performance in various scenarios based on our definition. Our results\nshow that a higher MID and a larger WCS degrade more the performance of the\nglobal model.

          "description": "While significant research advances have been made in the field of deep\nreinforcement learning, a major challenge to widespread industrial adoption of\ndeep reinforcement learning that has recently surfaced but little explored is\nthe potential vulnerability to privacy breaches. In particular, there have been\nno concrete adversarial attack strategies in literature tailored for studying\nthe vulnerability of deep reinforcement learning algorithms to membership\ninference attacks. To address this gap, we propose an adversarial attack\nframework tailored for testing the vulnerability of deep reinforcement learning\nalgorithms to membership inference attacks. More specifically, we design a\nseries of experiments to investigate the impact of temporal correlation, which\nnaturally exists in reinforcement learning training data, on the probability of\ninformation leakage. Furthermore, we study the differences in the performance\nof \\emph{collective} and \\emph{individual} membership attacks against deep\nreinforcement learning algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed\nadversarial attack framework is surprisingly effective at inferring the data\nused during deep reinforcement training with an accuracy exceeding $84\\%$ in\nindividual and $97\\%$ in collective mode on two different control tasks in\nOpenAI Gym, which raises serious privacy concerns in the deployment of models\nresulting from deep reinforcement learning. Moreover, we show that the learning\nstate of a reinforcement learning algorithm significantly influences the level\nof the privacy breach.",

Our DAE-PINN bases its effectiveness on the synergy\nbetween implicit Runge-Kutta time-stepping schemes (designed specifically for\nsolving DAEs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINN) (deep neural networks\nthat we train to satisfy the dynamics of the underlying problem). Furthermore,\nour framework (i) enforces the neural network to satisfy the DAEs as\n(approximate) hard constraints using a penalty-based method and (ii) enables\nsimulating DAEs for long-time horizons.

          "description": "This paper addresses the problem of policy selection in domains with abundant\nlogged data, but with a very restricted interaction budget. Solving this\nproblem would enable safe evaluation and deployment of offline reinforcement\nlearning policies in industry, robotics, and recommendation domains among\nothers. Several off-policy evaluation (OPE) techniques have been proposed to\nassess the value of policies using only logged data. However, there is still a\nbig gap between the evaluation by OPE and the full online evaluation in the\nreal environment. At the same time, large amount of online interactions is\noften not feasible in practice. To overcome this problem, we introduce\n\\emph{active offline policy selection} -- a novel sequential decision approach\nthat combines logged data with online interaction to identify the best policy.\nThis approach uses OPE estimates to warm start the online evaluation. Then, in\norder to utilize the limited environment interactions wisely, it relies on a\nBayesian optimization method, with a kernel function that represents policy\nsimilarity, to decide which policy to evaluate next. We use multiple benchmarks\nwith a large number of candidate policies to show that the proposed approach\nimproves upon state-of-the-art OPE estimates and pure online policy evaluation.",

          "description": "Opinion summarization has been traditionally approached with unsupervised,\nweakly-supervised and few-shot learning techniques. In this work, we collect a\nlarge dataset of summaries paired with user reviews for over 31,000 products,\nenabling supervised training. However, the number of reviews per product is\nlarge (320 on average), making summarization - and especially training a\nsummarizer - impractical. Moreover, the content of many reviews is not\nreflected in the human-written summaries, and, thus, the summarizer trained on\nrandom review subsets hallucinates. In order to deal with both of these\nchallenges, we formulate the task as jointly learning to select informative\nsubsets of reviews and summarizing the opinions expressed in these subsets. The\nchoice of the review subset is treated as a latent variable, predicted by a\nsmall and simple selector. The subset is then fed into a more powerful\nsummarizer. For joint training, we use amortized variational inference and\npolicy gradient methods. Our experiments demonstrate the importance of\nselecting informative reviews resulting in improved quality of summaries and\nreduced hallucinations.",

In this\npaper, we present an on- and off-policy multi-objective reinforcement learning\n(RL) approach, that does not assume a model a priori, benchmarking this against\na linear MPC (LMPC - to reflect current practice, though non-linear MPC\nperforms better) - both derived from the general optimal control problem,\nhighlighting their differences and similarities. In a simple multi-energy\nsystem (MES) configuration case study, we show that a twin delayed deep\ndeterministic policy gradient (TD3) RL agent offers potential to match and\noutperform the perfect foresight LMPC benchmark (101.5%). This while the\nrealistic LMPC, i.e. imperfect predictions, only achieves 98%. While in a more\ncomplex MES system configuration, the RL agent's performance is generally lower\n(94.6%), yet still better than the realistic LMPC (88.9%). In both case\nstudies, the RL agents outperformed the realistic LMPC after a training period\nof 2 years using quarterly interactions with the environment. We conclude that\nreinforcement learning is a viable optimal control technique for multi-energy\nsystems given adequate constraint handling and pre-training, to avoid unsafe\ninteractions and long training periods, as is proposed in fundamental future\nwork.",

          "description": "Machine learning models that can generalize to unseen domains are essential\nwhen applied in real-world scenarios involving strong domain shifts. We address\nthe challenging domain generalization (DG) problem, where a model trained on a\nset of source domains is expected to generalize well in unseen domains without\nany exposure to their data. The main challenge of DG is that the features\nlearned from the source domains are not necessarily present in the unseen\ntarget domains, leading to performance deterioration. We assume that learning a\nricher set of features is crucial to improve the transfer to a wider set of\nunknown domains. For this reason, we propose COLUMBUS, a method that enforces\nnew feature discovery via a targeted corruption of the most relevant input and\nmulti-level representations of the data.

For query-efficiency, surrogate\nmodels of the victim are adopted as transferable attackers in consideration of\ntheir Gradient Similarity (GS), i.e., surrogates' attack gradients are similar\nto the victim's ones to some extent. However, it is generally neglected to\nexploit their similarity on outputs, namely the Prediction Similarity (PS), to\nfilter out inefficient queries. To jointly utilize and also optimize\nsurrogates' GS and PS, we develop QueryNet, an efficient attack network that\ncan significantly reduce queries. QueryNet crafts several transferable\nAdversarial Examples (AEs) by surrogates, and then decides also by surrogates\non the most promising AE, which is then sent to query the victim. That is to\nsay, in QueryNet, surrogates are not only exploited as transferable attackers,\nbut also as transferability evaluators for AEs. The AEs are generated using\nsurrogates' GS and evaluated based on their PS, and therefore, the query\nresults could be back-propagated to optimize surrogates' parameters and also\ntheir architectures, enhancing both the GS and the PS.

However, the current logging\nprocess is mostly manual and ad hoc, and thus, proper placement and content of\nlogging statements remain as challenges. To overcome these challenges, methods\nthat aim to automate log placement and log content, i.e., 'where, what, and how\nto log', are of high interest.

For this purpose, we perform an experimental\nanalysis on seven open-source java projects, extract their method-level code\nclones, investigate their attributes, and utilize them for log location and\ndescription prediction.

First, we construct a dictionary-based\nheterogeneous graph (DHG) from bilingual dictionaries. This opens the\npossibility to use graph neural networks for cross-lingual transfer. The\nremaining challenge is the heterogeneity of DHG because multiple languages are\nconsidered. To address this challenge, we propose dictionary-based\nheterogeneous graph neural network (DHGNet) that effectively handles the\nheterogeneity of DHG by two-step aggregations, which are word-level and\nlanguage-level aggregations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\noutperforms pretrained models even though it does not access to large corpora.\nFurthermore, it can perform well even though dictionaries contain many\nincorrect translations.

          "description": "Particle physics simulations are the cornerstone of nuclear engineering\napplications. Among them radiotherapy (RT) is crucial for society, with 50% of\ncancer patients receiving radiation treatments. For the most precise targeting\nof tumors, next generation RT treatments aim for real-time correction during\nradiation delivery, necessitating particle transport algorithms that yield\nprecise dose distributions in sub-second times even in highly heterogeneous\npatient geometries. This is infeasible with currently available, purely physics\nbased simulations. In this study, we present a data-driven dose calculation\nalgorithm predicting the dose deposited by mono-energetic proton beams for\narbitrary energies and patient geometries. Our approach frames particle\ntransport as sequence modeling, where convolutional layers extract important\nspatial features into tokens and the transformer self-attention mechanism\nroutes information between such tokens in the sequence and a beam energy token.\nWe train our network and evaluate prediction accuracy using computationally\nexpensive but accurate Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, considered the gold\nstandard in particle physics. Our proposed model is 33 times faster than\ncurrent clinical analytic pencil beam algorithms, improving upon their accuracy\nin the most heterogeneous and challenging geometries. With a relative error of\n0.34% and very high gamma pass rate of 99.59% (1%, 3 mm), it also greatly\noutperforms the only published similar data-driven proton dose algorithm, even\nat a finer grid resolution. Offering MC precision 400 times faster, our model\ncould overcome a major obstacle that has so far prohibited real-time adaptive\nproton treatments and significantly increase cancer treatment efficacy. Its\npotential to model physics interactions of other particles could also boost\nheavy ion treatment planning procedures limited by the speed of traditional\nmethods.",

          "description": "The Random Utility Maximization model is by far the most adopted framework to\nestimate consumer choice behavior. However, behavioral economics has provided\nstrong empirical evidence of irrational choice behavior, such as halo effects,\nthat are incompatible with this framework. Models belonging to the Random\nUtility Maximization family may therefore not accurately capture such\nirrational behavior. Hence, more general choice models, overcoming such\nlimitations, have been proposed. However, the flexibility of such models comes\nat the price of increased risk of overfitting. As such, estimating such models\nremains a challenge. In this work, we propose an estimation method for the\nrecently proposed Generalized Stochastic Preference choice model, which\nsubsumes the family of Random Utility Maximization models and is capable of\ncapturing halo effects. Specifically, we show how to use partially-ranked\npreferences to efficiently model rational and irrational customer types from\ntransaction data. Our estimation procedure is based on column generation, where\nrelevant customer types are efficiently extracted by expanding a tree-like data\nstructure containing the customer behaviors. Further, we propose a new\ndominance rule among customer types whose effect is to prioritize low orders of\ninteractions among products. An extensive set of experiments assesses the\npredictive accuracy of the proposed approach. Our results show that accounting\nfor irrational preferences can boost predictive accuracy by 12.5% on average,\nwhen tested on a real-world dataset from a large chain of grocery and drug\nstores.",

This paper proposes a\ncoordinate descent method for minimizing DC functions based on sequential\nnonconvex approximation. Our approach iteratively solves a nonconvex\none-dimensional subproblem globally, and it is guaranteed to converge to a\ncoordinate-wise stationary point. We prove that this new optimality condition\nis always stronger than the critical point condition and the directional point\ncondition when the objective function is weakly convex. For comparisons, we\nalso include a naive variant of coordinate descent methods based on sequential\nconvex approximation in our study. When the objective function satisfies an\nadditional regularity condition called \\emph{sharpness}, coordinate descent\nmethods with an appropriate initialization converge \\emph{linearly} to the\noptimal solution set. Also, for many applications of interest, we show that the\nnonconvex one-dimensional subproblem can be computed exactly and efficiently\nusing a breakpoint searching method.

          "description": "Spectral clustering is a popular method for community detection in network\ngraphs: starting from a matrix representation of the graph, the nodes are\nclustered on a low dimensional projection obtained from a truncated spectral\ndecomposition of the matrix. Estimating correctly the number of communities and\nthe dimension of the reduced latent space is critical for good performance of\nspectral clustering algorithms. Furthermore, many real-world graphs, such as\nenterprise computer networks studied in cyber-security applications, often\ndisplay heterogeneous within-community degree distributions. Such heterogeneous\ndegree distributions are usually not well captured by standard spectral\nclustering algorithms. In this article, a novel spectral clustering algorithm\nis proposed for community detection under the degree-corrected stochastic\nblockmodel. The proposed method is based on a transformation of the spectral\nembedding to spherical coordinates, and a novel modelling assumption in the\ntransformed space. The method allows for simultaneous and automated selection\nof the number of communities and the latent dimension for spectral embeddings\nof graphs with uneven node degrees. Results show improved performance over\ncompeting methods in representing computer networks.",

In particular, if the similarity and the order relation\nare not aligned, then order preservation may have to yield in favor of\nclustering.

For most processes of interest the underlying SCM will only be\npartially observable, thus causal inference tries to leverage any exposed\ninformation. Graph neural networks (GNN) as universal approximators on\nstructured input pose a viable candidate for causal learning, suggesting a\ntighter integration with SCM. To this effect we present a theoretical analysis\nfrom first principles that establishes a novel connection between GNN and SCM\nwhile providing an extended view on general neural-causal models.

          "description": "To successfully tackle challenging manipulation tasks, autonomous agents must\nlearn a diverse set of skills and how to combine them. Recently,\nself-supervised agents that set their own abstract goals by exploiting the\ndiscovered structure in the environment were shown to perform well on many\ndifferent tasks. In particular, some of them were applied to learn basic\nmanipulation skills in compositional multi-object environments. However, these\nmethods learn skills without taking the dependencies between objects into\naccount. Thus, the learned skills are difficult to combine in realistic\nenvironments. We propose a novel self-supervised agent that estimates relations\nbetween environment components and uses them to independently control different\nparts of the environment state. In addition, the estimated relations between\nobjects can be used to decompose a complex goal into a compatible sequence of\nsubgoals. We show that, by using this framework, an agent can efficiently and\nautomatically learn manipulation tasks in multi-object environments with\ndifferent relations between objects.",

          "description": "Deep learning models usually require a large amount of labeled data to\nachieve satisfactory performance. In multimedia analysis, domain adaptation\nstudies the problem of cross-domain knowledge transfer from a label rich source\ndomain to a label scarce target domain, thus potentially alleviates the\nannotation requirement for deep learning models. However, we find that\ncontemporary domain adaptation methods for cross-domain image understanding\nperform poorly when source domain is noisy. Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation\n(WSDA) studies the domain adaptation problem under the scenario where source\ndata can be noisy. Prior methods on WSDA remove noisy source data and align the\nmarginal distribution across domains without considering the fine-grained\nsemantic structure in the embedding space, which have the problem of class\nmisalignment, e.g., features of cats in the target domain might be mapped near\nfeatures of dogs in the source domain. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmethod, termed Noise Tolerant Domain Adaptation, for WSDA. Specifically, we\nadopt the cluster assumption and learn cluster discriminatively with class\nprototypes in the embedding space. We propose to leverage the location\ninformation of the data points in the embedding space and model the location\ninformation with a Gaussian mixture model to identify noisy source data. We\nthen design a network which incorporates the Gaussian mixture noise model as a\nsub-module for unsupervised noise removal and propose a novel cluster-level\nadversarial adaptation method which aligns unlabeled target data with the less\nnoisy class prototypes for mapping the semantic structure across domains. We\nconduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method on\nboth general images and medical images from COVID-19 and e-commerce datasets.\nThe results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nWSDA methods.",

In fall 2020, Twitter users raised\nconcerns that the automated image cropping system on Twitter favored\nlight-skinned over dark-skinned individuals, as well as concerns that the\nsystem favored cropping woman's bodies instead of their heads. In order to\naddress these concerns, we conduct an extensive analysis using formalized group\nfairness metrics. We find systematic disparities in cropping and identify\ncontributing factors, including the fact that the cropping based on the single\nmost salient point can amplify the disparities because of an effect we term\nargmax bias. However, we demonstrate that formalized fairness metrics and\nquantitative analysis on their own are insufficient for capturing the risk of\nrepresentational harm in automatic cropping. We suggest the removal of\nsaliency-based cropping in favor of a solution that better preserves user\nagency.

          "description": "The proposition of lottery ticket hypothesis revealed the relationship\nbetween network structure and initialization parameters and the learning\npotential of neural networks. The original lottery ticket hypothesis performs\npruning and weight resetting after training convergence, exposing it to the\nproblem of forgotten learning knowledge and potential high cost of training.\nTherefore, we propose a strategy that combines the idea of neural network\nstructure search with a pruning algorithm to alleviate this problem. This\nalgorithm searches and extends the network structure on existing winning ticket\nsub-network to producing new winning ticket recursively. This allows the\ntraining and pruning process to continue without compromising performance. A\nnew winning ticket sub-network with deeper network structure, better\ngeneralization ability and better test performance can be obtained in this\nrecursive manner. This method can solve: the difficulty of training or\nperformance degradation of the sub-networks after pruning, the forgetting of\nthe weights of the original lottery ticket hypothesis and the difficulty of\ngenerating winning ticket sub-network when the final network structure is not\ngiven. We validate this strategy on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. And after\nrelating it to similar biological phenomena and relevant lottery ticket\nhypothesis studies in recent years, we will further propose a new hypothesis to\ndiscuss which factors that can keep a network juvenile, i.e., those possible\nfactors that influence the learning potential or generalization performance of\na neural network during training.",

SensiX++ operates on two fundamental principles - highly modular\ncomponentisation to externalise data operations with clear abstractions and\ndocument-centric manifestation for system-wide orchestration. First, a data\ncoordinator manages the lifecycle of sensors and serves models with correct\ndata through automated transformations. Next, a resource-aware model server\nexecutes multiple models in isolation through model abstraction, pipeline\nautomation and feature sharing. An adaptive scheduler then orchestrates the\nbest-effort executions of multiple models across heterogeneous accelerators,\nbalancing latency and throughput. Finally, microservices with REST APIs serve\nsynthesised model predictions, system statistics, and continuous deployment.\nCollectively, these components enable SensiX++ to serve multiple models\nefficiently with fine-grained control on edge devices while minimising data\noperation redundancy, managing data and device heterogeneity, reducing resource\ncontention and removing manual MLOps. We benchmark SensiX++ with ten different\nvision and acoustics models across various multi-tenant configurations on\ndifferent edge accelerators (Jetson AGX and Coral TPU) designed for sensory\ndevices. We report on the overall throughput and quantified benefits of various\nautomation components of SensiX++ and demonstrate its efficacy to significantly\nreduce operational complexity and lower the effort to deploy, upgrade,\nreconfigure and serve embedded models on edge devices.",

QUINT is the first of its kind that provides\ntremendous gain in terms of speed and space usage without compromising much on\nthe accuracy of the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted to\ncompare QUINT with seven state-of-the-art network embedding methods for two end\ntasks - link prediction and node classification. We observe huge performance\ngain for QUINT in terms of speedup (up to 7000x) and space saving (up to 800x)\ndue to its bit-wise nature to obtain node embedding. Moreover, QUINT is a\nconsistent top-performer for both the tasks among the baselines across all the\ndatasets.

          "description": "Data augmentation has been widely used in image data and linguistic data but\nremains under-explored on graph-structured data. Existing methods focus on\naugmenting the graph data from a global perspective and largely fall into two\ngenres: structural manipulation and adversarial training with feature noise\ninjection. However, the structural manipulation approach suffers information\nloss issues while the adversarial training approach may downgrade the feature\nquality by injecting noise. In this work, we introduce the local augmentation,\nwhich enhances node features by its local subgraph structures. Specifically, we\nmodel the data argumentation as a feature generation process. Given the central\nnode's feature, our local augmentation approach learns the conditional\ndistribution of its neighbors' features and generates the neighbors' optimal\nfeature to boost the performance of downstream tasks. Based on the local\naugmentation, we further design a novel framework: LA-GNN, which can apply to\nany GNN models in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments and analyses\nshow that local augmentation consistently yields performance improvement for\nvarious GNN architectures across a diverse set of benchmarks.

          "description": "Biocatalysis is a promising approach to sustainably synthesize\npharmaceuticals, complex natural products, and commodity chemicals at scale.\nHowever, the adoption of biocatalysis is limited by our ability to select\nenzymes that will catalyze their natural chemical transformation on non-natural\nsubstrates. While machine learning and in silico directed evolution are\nwell-posed for this predictive modeling challenge, efforts to date have\nprimarily aimed to increase activity against a single known substrate, rather\nthan to identify enzymes capable of acting on new substrates of interest. To\naddress this need, we curate 6 different high-quality enzyme family screens\nfrom the literature that each measure multiple enzymes against multiple\nsubstrates. We compare machine learning-based compound-protein interaction\n(CPI) modeling approaches from the literature used for predicting drug-target\ninteractions. Surprisingly, comparing these interaction-based models against\ncollections of independent (single task) enzyme-only or substrate-only models\nreveals that current CPI approaches are incapable of learning interactions\nbetween compounds and proteins in the current family level data regime. We\nfurther validate this observation by demonstrating that our no-interaction\nbaseline can outperform CPI-based models from the literature used to guide the\ndiscovery of kinase inhibitors. Given the high performance of non-interaction\nbased models, we introduce a new structure-based strategy for pooling residue\nrepresentations across a protein sequence. Altogether, this work motivates a\nprincipled path forward in order to build and evaluate meaningful predictive\nmodels for biocatalysis and other drug discovery applications.",

In this paper we offer an alternative, using symbolic\nconstraint solvers. We model the network and a formal specification of a\nsensitive sample in the language of the solver and ask for a solution. This\napproach supports a rich class of queries, corresponding, for instance, to the\npresence of certain types of attacks. Unlike earlier techniques, our approach\ndoes not depend on convex search domains, or on the suitability of a starting\npoint for the search. We address the performance limitations of constraint\nsolvers by partitioning the search space for the solver, and exploring the\npartitions according to a balanced schedule that still retains completeness of\nthe search. We demonstrate the impact of the use of solvers in terms of\nfunctionality and search efficiency, using a case study for the detection of\nTrojan attacks on Neural Networks.",

          "description": "Conventional unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods need to access both\nlabeled source samples and unlabeled target samples simultaneously to train the\nmodel. While in some scenarios, the source samples are not available for the\ntarget domain due to data privacy and safety. To overcome this challenge,\nrecently, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) has attracted the attention of\nresearchers, where both a trained source model and unlabeled target samples are\ngiven. Existing SFDA methods either adopt a pseudo-label based strategy or\ngenerate more samples. However, these methods do not explicitly reduce the\ndistribution shift across domains, which is the key to a good adaptation.\nAlthough there are no source samples available, fortunately, we find that some\ntarget samples are very similar to the source domain and can be used to\napproximate the source domain. This approximated domain is denoted as the\npseudo-source domain. In this paper, inspired by this observation, we propose a\nnovel method based on the pseudo-source domain. The proposed method firstly\ngenerates and augments the pseudo-source domain, and then employs distribution\nalignment with four novel losses based on pseudo-label based strategy. Among\nthem, a domain adversarial loss is introduced between the pseudo-source domain\nthe remaining target domain to reduce the distribution shift. The results on\nthree real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

          "description": "The success of deep learning can be attributed to various factors such as\nincrease in computational power, large datasets, deep convolutional neural\nnetworks, optimizers etc. Particularly, the choice of optimizer affects the\ngeneralization, convergence rate, and training stability. Stochastic Gradient\nDescent (SGD) is a first order iterative optimizer that updates the gradient\nuniformly for all parameters. This uniform update may not be suitable across\nthe entire training phase. A rudimentary solution for this is to employ a\nfine-tuned learning rate scheduler which decreases learning rate as a function\nof iteration. To eliminate the dependency of learning rate schedulers, adaptive\ngradient optimizers such as AdaGrad, AdaDelta, RMSProp, Adam employ a\nparameter-wise scaling term for learning rate which is a function of the\ngradient itself. We propose Tom (Trend over Momentum) optimizer, which is a\nnovel variant of Adam that takes into account of the trend which is observed\nfor the gradients in the loss landscape traversed by the neural network. In the\nproposed Tom optimizer, an additional smoothing equation is introduced to\naddress the trend observed during the process of optimization. The smoothing\nparameter introduced for the trend requires no tuning and can be used with\ndefault values. Experimental results for classification datasets such as\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and CINIC-10 image datasets show that Tom outperforms\nAdagrad, Adadelta, RMSProp and Adam in terms of both accuracy and has a faster\nconvergence.

We further show how to practically\noptimize this objective for large translation corpora using an iterated best\nresponse scheme, which is both effective and incurs negligible additional\ncomputational cost compared to standard empirical risk minimization.

          "description": "Physics-informed Machine Learning has recently become attractive for learning\nphysical parameters and features from simulation and observation data. However,\nmost existing methods do not ensure that the physics, such as balance laws\n(e.g., mass, momentum, energy conservation), are constrained. Some recent works\n(e.g., physics-informed neural networks) softly enforce physics constraints by\nincluding partial differential equation (PDE)-based loss functions but need\nre-discretization of the PDEs using auto-differentiation. Training these neural\nnets on observational data showed that one could solve forward and inverse\nproblems in one shot. They evaluate the state variables and the parameters in a\nPDE. This re-discretization of PDEs is not necessarily an attractive option for\ndomain scientists that work with physics-based codes that have been developed\nfor decades with sophisticated discretization techniques to solve complex\nprocess models and advanced equations of state. This paper proposes a physics\nconstrained machine learning framework, AdjointNet, allowing domain scientists\nto embed their physics code in neural network training workflows. This\nembedding ensures that physics is constrained everywhere in the domain.\nAdditionally, the mathematical properties such as consistency, stability, and\nconvergence vital to the numerical solution of a PDE are still satisfied. We\nshow that the proposed AdjointNet framework can be used for parameter\nestimation (and uncertainty quantification by extension) and experimental\ndesign using active learning. The applicability of our framework is\ndemonstrated for four flow cases. Results show that AdjointNet-based inversion\ncan estimate process model parameters with reasonable accuracy. These examples\ndemonstrate the applicability of using existing software with no changes in\nsource code to perform accurate and reliable inversion of model parameters.",

In this work, we propose\nOverLORD, a single framework for disentangling labeled and unlabeled attributes\nas well as synthesizing high-fidelity images, which is composed of two stages;\n(i) Disentanglement: Learning disentangled representations with latent\noptimization. Differently from previous approaches, we do not rely on\nadversarial training or any architectural biases. (ii) Synthesis: Training\nfeed-forward encoders for inferring the learned attributes and tuning the\ngenerator in an adversarial manner to increase the perceptual quality. When the\nlabeled and unlabeled attributes are correlated, we model an additional\nrepresentation that accounts for the correlated attributes and improves\ndisentanglement. We highlight that our flexible framework covers multiple\nsettings as disentangling labeled attributes, pose and appearance, localized\nconcepts, and shape and texture. We present significantly better\ndisentanglement with higher translation quality and greater output diversity\nthan state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "A recent variation of Transformer, Performer, scales Transformer to longer\nsequences with a linear attention mechanism. However, it is not compatible with\nrelative position encoding, which has advantages over absolute position\nencoding. In this paper, we discuss possible ways to add relative position\nencoding to Performer. Based on the analysis, we propose PermuteFormer, a\nPerformer-based model with relative position encoding that scales linearly on\nlong sequences. PermuteFormer applies position-dependent transformation on\nqueries and keys to encode positional information into the attention module.\nThis transformation is carefully crafted so that the final output of\nself-attention is not affected by absolute positions of tokens. PermuteFormer\nintroduces negligible computational overhead by design that it runs as fast as\nPerformer. We evaluate PermuteFormer on Long-Range Arena, a dataset for long\nsequences, as well as WikiText-103, a language modeling dataset. The\nexperiments show that PermuteFormer uniformly improves the performance of\nPerformer with almost no computational overhead and outperforms vanilla\nTransformer on most of the tasks.",

          "description": "Current app ranking and recommendation systems are mainly based on\nuser-generated information, e.g., number of downloads and ratings. However, new\napps often have few (or even no) user feedback, suffering from the classic\ncold-start problem. How to quickly identify and then recommend new apps of high\nquality is a challenging issue. Here, a fundamental requirement is the\ncapability to accurately measure an app's quality based on its inborn features,\nrather than user-generated features. Since users obtain first-hand experience\nof an app by interacting with its views, we speculate that the inborn features\nare largely related to the visual quality of individual views in an app and the\nways the views switch to one another. In this work, we propose AppQ, a novel\napp quality grading and recommendation system that extracts inborn features of\napps based on app source code. In particular, AppQ works in parallel to perform\ncode analysis to extract app-level features as well as dynamic analysis to\ncapture view-level layout hierarchy and the switching among views. Each app is\nthen expressed as an attributed view graph, which is converted into a vector\nand fed to classifiers for recognizing its quality classes. Our evaluation with\nan app dataset from Google Play reports that AppQ achieves the best performance\nwith accuracy of 85.0\\%. This shows a lot of promise to warm-start app grading\nand recommendation systems with AppQ.",

However,\nregarding Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN), existing HIN-oriented GCN\nmethods still suffer from two deficiencies: (1) they cannot flexibly explore\nall possible meta-paths and extract the most useful ones for a target object,\nwhich hinders both effectiveness and interpretability; (2) they often need to\ngenerate intermediate meta-path based dense graphs, which leads to high\ncomputational complexity. To address the above issues, we propose an\ninterpretable and efficient Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (ie-HGCN)\nto learn the representations of objects in HINs. It is designed as a\nhierarchical aggregation architecture, i.e., object-level aggregation first,\nfollowed by type-level aggregation. The novel architecture can automatically\nextract useful meta-paths for each object from all possible meta-paths (within\na length limit), which brings good model interpretability. It can also reduce\nthe computational cost by avoiding intermediate HIN transformation and\nneighborhood attention. We provide theoretical analysis about the proposed\nie-HGCN in terms of evaluating the usefulness of all possible meta-paths, its\nconnection to the spectral graph convolution on HINs, and its quasi-linear time\ncomplexity.

However, two-point schemes require two evaluations\nof the objective function at each iteration, which can be impractical in\napplications where the data are not all available a priori, e.g., in online\noptimization. In this paper, we propose a novel one-point feedback scheme that\nqueries the function value once at each iteration and estimates the gradient\nusing the residual between two consecutive points. When optimizing a\ndeterministic Lipschitz function, we show that the query complexity of ZO with\nthe proposed one-point residual feedback matches that of ZO with the existing\ntwo-point schemes. Moreover, the query complexity of the proposed algorithm can\nbe improved when the objective function has Lipschitz gradient. Then, for\nstochastic bandit optimization problems where only noisy objective function\nvalues are given, we show that ZO with one-point residual feedback achieves the\nsame convergence rate as that of two-point scheme with uncontrollable data\nsamples.

          "description": "Machine learning methods have greatly changed science, engineering, finance,\nbusiness, and other fields. Despite the tremendous accomplishments of machine\nlearning and deep learning methods, many challenges still remain. In\nparticular, the performance of machine learning methods is often severely\naffected in case of diverse data, usually associated with smaller data sets or\ndata related to areas of study where the size of the data sets is constrained\nby the complexity and/or high cost of experiments. Moreover, data with limited\nlabeled samples is a challenge to most learning approaches. In this paper, the\naforementioned challenges are addressed by integrating graph-based frameworks,\nmultiscale structure, modified and adapted optimization procedures and\nsemi-supervised techniques. This results in two innovative multiscale Laplacian\nlearning (MLL) approaches for machine learning tasks, such as data\nclassification, and for tackling diverse data, data with limited samples and\nsmaller data sets. The first approach, called multikernel manifold learning\n(MML), integrates manifold learning with multikernel information and solves a\nregularization problem consisting of a loss function and a warped kernel\nregularizer using multiscale graph Laplacians. The second approach, called the\nmultiscale MBO (MMBO) method, introduces multiscale Laplacians to a\nmodification of the famous classical Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme, and\nmakes use of fast solvers for finding the approximations to the extremal\neigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. We demonstrate the performance of our\nmethods experimentally on a variety of data sets, such as biological, text and\nimage data, and compare them favorably to existing approaches.",

          "description": "Tensor decompositions, such as CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP), are widely used in a\nvariety of applications, such as chemometrics, signal processing, and machine\nlearning. A broadly used method for computing such decompositions relies on the\nAlternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm. When the number of components is\nsmall, regardless of its implementation, ALS exhibits low arithmetic intensity,\nwhich severely hinders its performance and makes GPU offloading ineffective. We\nobserve that, in practice, experts often have to compute multiple\ndecompositions of the same tensor, each with a small number of components\n(typically fewer than 20), to ultimately find the best ones to use for the\napplication at hand. In this paper, we illustrate how multiple decompositions\nof the same tensor can be fused together at the algorithmic level to increase\nthe arithmetic intensity. Therefore, it becomes possible to make efficient use\nof GPUs for further speedups; at the same time the technique is compatible with\nmany enhancements typically used in ALS, such as line search, extrapolation,\nand non-negativity constraints. We introduce the Concurrent ALS algorithm and\nlibrary, which offers an interface to Matlab, and a mechanism to effectively\ndeal with the issue that decompositions complete at different times.\nExperimental results on artificial and real datasets demonstrate a shorter time\nto completion due to increased arithmetic intensity.",

          "description": "Graph Neural Network (GNN) research is rapidly growing thanks to the capacity\nof GNNs in learning distributed representations from graph-structured data.\nHowever, centralizing a massive amount of real-world graph data for GNN\ntraining is prohibitive due to privacy concerns, regulation restrictions, and\ncommercial competitions. Federated learning (FL), a trending distributed\nlearning paradigm, provides possibilities to solve this challenge while\npreserving data privacy. Despite recent advances in vision and language\ndomains, there is no suitable platform for the FL of GNNs. To this end, we\nintroduce FedGraphNN, an open FL benchmark system that can facilitate research\non federated GNNs. FedGraphNN is built on a unified formulation of graph FL and\ncontains a wide range of datasets from different domains, popular GNN models,\nand FL algorithms, with secure and efficient system support. Particularly for\nthe datasets, we collect, preprocess, and partition 36 datasets from 7 domains,\nincluding both publicly available ones and specifically obtained ones such as\nhERG and Tencent. Our empirical analysis showcases the utility of our benchmark\nsystem, while exposing significant challenges in graph FL: federated GNNs\nperform worse in most datasets with a non-IID split than centralized GNNs; the\nGNN model that attains the best result in the centralized setting may not\nmaintain its advantage in the FL setting. These results imply that more\nresearch efforts are needed to unravel the mystery behind federated GNNs.\nMoreover, our system performance analysis demonstrates that the FedGraphNN\nsystem is computationally efficient and secure to large-scale graphs datasets.\nWe maintain the source code at https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedGraphNN.",

When being applied to clean examples and their\nadversarial counterparts, AT+ALP improves accuracy on adversarial examples over\nadversarial training.

For example, on 17 Flower Category Database, under strong\n200-iteration PGD gray-box and black-box attacks where prior art has 34% and\n39% accuracy, our method achieves 50% and 51%. Compared with previous work, our\nwork is evaluated under highly challenging PGD attack: the maximum perturbation\n$\\epsilon \\in \\{0.25,0.5\\}$ i.e. $L_\\infty \\in \\{0.25,0.5\\}$ with 10 to 200\nattack iterations. To the best of our knowledge, such a strong attack has not\nbeen previously explored on a wide range of datasets.",

The credit\nassignment problem, the non-stationarity of the communication environment and\nthe creation of influenceable agents are major challenges within this research\nfield which need to be overcome in order to learn a valid communication\nprotocol. This paper introduces the novel multi-agent counterfactual\ncommunication learning (MACC) method which adapts counterfactual reasoning in\norder to overcome the credit assignment problem for communicating agents.\nSecondly, the non-stationarity of the communication environment while learning\nthe communication Q-function is overcome by creating the communication\nQ-function using the action policy of the other agents and the Q-function of\nthe action environment. Additionally, a social loss function is introduced in\norder to create influenceable agents which is required to learn a valid\ncommunication protocol.

Therefore, it is important to develop algorithms that help the\ntraining of deep networks and their generalization to noise-free test sets. In\nthis paper, we propose a robust training strategy against label noise, called\nRAFNI, that can be used with any CNN. This algorithm filters and relabels\ninstances of the training set based on the predictions and their probabilities\nmade by the backbone neural network during the training process. That way, this\nalgorithm improves the generalization ability of the CNN on its own. RAFNI\nconsists of three mechanisms: two mechanisms that filter instances and one\nmechanism that relabels instances. In addition, it does not suppose that the\nnoise rate is known nor does it need to be estimated. We evaluated our\nalgorithm using different data sets of several sizes and characteristics. We\nalso compared it with state-of-the-art models using the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100\nbenchmarks under different types and rates of label noise and found that RAFNI\nachieves better results in most cases.",

          "description": "In this paper, an interpretable classifier using an interval type-2 fuzzy\nneural network for detecting patients suffering from Parkinson's Disease (PD)\nbased on analyzing the gait cycle is presented. The proposed method utilizes\nclinical features extracted from the vertical Ground Reaction Force (vGRF),\nmeasured by 16 wearable sensors placed in the soles of subjects' shoes and\nlearns interpretable fuzzy rules. Therefore, experts can verify the decision\nmade by the proposed method based on investigating the firing strength of\ninterpretable fuzzy rules. Moreover, experts can utilize the extracted fuzzy\nrules for patient diagnosing or adjust them based on their knowledge. To\nimprove the robustness of the proposed method against uncertainty and noisy\nsensor measurements, Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic is applied. To learn fuzzy\nrules, two paradigms are proposed: 1- A batch learning approach based on\nclustering available samples is applied to extract initial fuzzy rules, 2- A\ncomplementary online learning is proposed to improve the rule base encountering\nnew labeled samples. The performance of the method is evaluated for classifying\npatients and healthy subjects in different conditions including the presence of\nnoise or observing new instances. Moreover, the performance of the model is\ncompared to some previous supervised and unsupervised machine learning\napproaches. The final Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score of the proposed\nmethod are 88.74%, 89.41%, 95.10%, and 92.16%. Finally, the extracted fuzzy\nsets for each feature are reported.",

          "description": "Deep AUC Maximization (DAM) is a new paradigm for learning a deep neural\nnetwork by maximizing the AUC score of the model on a dataset. Most previous\nworks of AUC maximization focus on the perspective of optimization by designing\nefficient stochastic algorithms, and studies on generalization performance of\nlarge-scale DAM on difficult tasks are missing. In this work, we aim to make\nDAM more practical for interesting real-world applications (e.g., medical image\nclassification). First, we propose a new margin-based min-max surrogate loss\nfunction for the AUC score (named as AUC min-max-margin loss or simply AUC\nmargin loss for short). It is more robust than the commonly used AUC square\nloss, while enjoying the same advantage in terms of large-scale stochastic\noptimization. Second, we conduct extensive empirical studies of our DAM method\non four difficult medical image classification tasks, namely (i) classification\nof chest x-ray images for identifying many threatening diseases, (ii)\nclassification of images of skin lesions for identifying melanoma, (iii)\nclassification of mammogram for breast cancer screening, and (iv)\nclassification of microscopic images for identifying tumor tissue. Our studies\ndemonstrate that the proposed DAM method improves the performance of optimizing\ncross-entropy loss by a large margin, and also achieves better performance than\noptimizing the existing AUC square loss on these medical image classification\ntasks. Specifically, our DAM method has achieved the 1st place on Stanford\nCheXpert competition on Aug. 31, 2020. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first work that makes DAM succeed on large-scale medical image datasets. We\nalso conduct extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the advantages of the\nnew AUC margin loss over the AUC square loss on benchmark datasets.

          "description": "Recent works report that increasing the learning rate or decreasing the\nminibatch size in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can improve test set\nperformance. We argue this is expected under some conditions in models with a\nloss function with multiple local minima. Our main contribution is an\napproximate but analytical approach inspired by methods in Physics to study the\nrole of the SGD learning rate and batch size in generalization. We characterize\ntest set performance under a shift between the training and test data\ndistributions for loss functions with multiple minima. The shift can simply be\ndue to sampling, and is therefore typically present in practical applications.\nWe show that the resulting shift in local minima worsens test performance by\npicking up curvature, implying that generalization improves by selecting wide\nand/or little-shifted local minima. We then specialize to SGD, and study its\ntest performance under stationarity. Because obtaining the exact stationary\ndistribution of SGD is intractable, we derive a Fokker-Planck approximation of\nSGD and obtain its stationary distribution instead. This process shows that the\nlearning rate divided by the minibatch size plays a role analogous to\ntemperature in statistical mechanics, and implies that SGD, including its\nstationary distribution, is largely invariant to changes in learning rate or\nbatch size that leave its temperature constant. We show that increasing SGD\ntemperature encourages the selection of local minima with lower curvature, and\ncan enable better generalization. We provide experiments on CIFAR10\ndemonstrating the temperature invariance of SGD, improvement of the test loss\nas SGD temperature increases, and quantifying the impact of sampling versus\ndomain shift in driving this effect. Finally, we present synthetic experiments\nshowing how our theory applies in a simplified loss with two local minima.",

This learning problem is\noften approached by describing various desiderata associated with learned\nrepresentations; e.g., that they be non-spurious, efficient, or disentangled.\nIt can be challenging, however, to turn these intuitive desiderata into formal\ncriteria that can be measured and enhanced based on observed data. In this\npaper, we take a causal perspective on representation learning, formalizing\nnon-spuriousness and efficiency (in supervised representation learning) and\ndisentanglement (in unsupervised representation learning) using counterfactual\nquantities and observable consequences of causal assertions.

However, realistic benchmarks\nand fundamental studies in this line are still missing. To bridge the gap, we\npresent a new online continual object detection benchmark with an egocentric\nvideo dataset, Objects Around Krishna (OAK). OAK adopts the KrishnaCAM videos,\nan ego-centric video stream collected over nine months by a graduate student.\nOAK provides exhaustive bounding box annotations of 80 video snippets (~17.5\nhours) for 105 object categories in outdoor scenes. The emergence of new object\ncategories in our benchmark follows a pattern similar to what a single person\nmight see in their day-to-day life. The dataset also captures the natural\ndistribution shifts as the person travels to different places. These egocentric\nlong-running videos provide a realistic playground for continual learning\nalgorithms, especially in online embodied settings. We also introduce new\nevaluation metrics to evaluate the model performance and catastrophic\nforgetting and provide baseline studies for online continual object detection.\nWe believe this benchmark will pose new exciting challenges for learning from\nnon-stationary data in continual learning.

The proposed magnetic\nresonance-guided deep decoder (MR-GDD) utilizes the spatial details and\nsemantic features of MR-guidance image more effectively by introducing\nencoder-decoder and deep decoder subnetworks. Moreover, the specific shapes and\npatterns of the guidance image do not affect the denoised PET image, because\nthe guidance image is input to the network through an attention gate. In a\nMonte Carlo simulation of [$^{18}$F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), the\nproposed method achieved the highest peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural\nsimilarity (27.92 $\\pm$ 0.44 dB/0.886 $\\pm$ 0.007), as compared with Gaussian\nfiltering (26.68 $\\pm$ 0.10 dB/0.807 $\\pm$ 0.004), image guided filtering\n(27.40 $\\pm$ 0.11 dB/0.849 $\\pm$ 0.003), deep image prior (DIP) (24.22 $\\pm$\n0.43 dB/0.737 $\\pm$ 0.017), and MR-DIP (27.65 $\\pm$ 0.42 dB/0.879 $\\pm$ 0.007).\nFurthermore, we experimentally visualized the behavior of the optimization\nprocess, which is often unknown in unsupervised CNN-based restoration problems.\nFor preclinical (using [$^{18}$F]FDG and [$^{11}$C]raclopride) and clinical\n(using [$^{18}$F]florbetapir) studies, the proposed method demonstrates\nstate-of-the-art denoising performance while retaining spatial resolution and\nquantitative accuracy, despite using a common network architecture for various\nnoisy PET images with 1/10th of the full counts.

This technique helps us understand the learning pattern\nof the deep network at its intermediate layers through their activation maps.\nInitially, we consider two state-of-the-art deep saliency models, namely UNISAL\nand MSI-Net for our interpretation. We use a set of biologically plausible\nlog-gabor filters for identifying and reconstructing the activation maps of\nthem using our explainable saliency model. The final saliency map is generated\nusing these reconstructed activation maps. We also build our own deep saliency\nmodel named cross-concatenated multi-scale residual block based network\n(CMRNet) for saliency prediction. Then, we evaluate and compare the performance\nof the explainable models derived from UNISAL, MSI-Net and CMRNet on three\nbenchmark datasets with other state-of-the-art methods.

NSRTs\nhave both symbolic and neural components, enabling a bilevel planning scheme\nwhere symbolic AI planning in an outer loop guides continuous planning with\nneural models in an inner loop.

          "description": "Recent work of Erlingsson, Feldman, Mironov, Raghunathan, Talwar, and\nThakurta [EFMRTT19] demonstrates that random shuffling amplifies differential\nprivacy guarantees of locally randomized data. Such amplification implies\nsubstantially stronger privacy guarantees for systems in which data is\ncontributed anonymously [BEMMRLRKTS17] and has lead to significant interest in\nthe shuffle model of privacy [CSUZZ19; EFMRTT19].\n\nWe show that random shuffling of $n$ data records that are input to\n$\\varepsilon_0$-differentially private local randomizers results in an\n$(O((1-e^{-\\varepsilon_0})\\sqrt{\\frac{e^{\\varepsilon_0}\\log(1/\\delta)}{n}}),\n\\delta)$-differentially private algorithm. This significantly improves over\nprevious work and achieves the asymptotically optimal dependence in\n$\\varepsilon_0$. Our result is based on a new approach that is simpler than\nprevious work and extends to approximate differential privacy with nearly the\nsame guarantees. Importantly, our work also yields an algorithm for deriving\ntighter bounds on the resulting $\\varepsilon$ and $\\delta$ as well as R\\'enyi\ndifferential privacy guarantees. We show numerically that our algorithm gets to\nwithin a small constant factor of the optimal bound. As a direct corollary of\nour analysis we derive a simple and nearly optimal algorithm for frequency\nestimation in the shuffle model of privacy. We also observe that our result\nimplies the first asymptotically optimal privacy analysis of noisy stochastic\ngradient descent that applies to sampling without replacement.",

          "description": "Recommender systems rely on user behavior data like ratings and clicks to\nbuild personalization model. However, the collected data is observational\nrather than experimental, causing various biases in the data which\nsignificantly affect the learned model. Most existing work for recommendation\ndebiasing, such as the inverse propensity scoring and imputation approaches,\nfocuses on one or two specific biases, lacking the universal capacity that can\naccount for mixed or even unknown biases in the data. Towards this research\ngap, we first analyze the origin of biases from the perspective of \\textit{risk\ndiscrepancy} that represents the difference between the expectation empirical\nrisk and the true risk. Remarkably, we derive a general learning framework that\nwell summarizes most existing debiasing strategies by specifying some\nparameters of the general framework. This provides a valuable opportunity to\ndevelop a universal solution for debiasing, e.g., by learning the debiasing\nparameters from data. However, the training data lacks important signal of how\nthe data is biased and what the unbiased data looks like. To move this idea\nforward, we propose \\textit{AotoDebias} that leverages another (small) set of\nuniform data to optimize the debiasing parameters by solving the bi-level\noptimization problem with meta-learning. Through theoretical analyses, we\nderive the generalization bound for AutoDebias and prove its ability to acquire\nthe appropriate debiasing strategy. Extensive experiments on two real datasets\nand a simulated dataset demonstrated effectiveness of AutoDebias. The code is\navailable at \\url{https://github.com/DongHande/AutoDebias}.",

          "description": "Choroid plexuses (CP) are structures of the ventricles of the brain which\nproduce most of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Several postmortem and in vivo\nstudies have pointed towards their role in the inflammatory process in multiple\nsclerosis (MS). Automatic segmentation of CP from MRI thus has high value for\nstudying their characteristics in large cohorts of patients. To the best of our\nknowledge, the only freely available tool for CP segmentation is FreeSurfer but\nits accuracy for this specific structure is poor. In this paper, we propose to\nautomatically segment CP from non-contrast enhanced T1-weighted MRI. To that\nend, we introduce a new model called \"Axial-MLP\" based on an assembly of Axial\nmulti-layer perceptrons (MLPs). This is inspired by recent works which showed\nthat the self-attention layers of Transformers can be replaced with MLPs. This\napproach is systematically compared with a standard 3D U-Net, nnU-Net,\nFreesurfer and FastSurfer. For our experiments, we make use of a dataset of 141\nsubjects (44 controls and 97 patients with MS). We show that all the tested\ndeep learning (DL) methods outperform FreeSurfer (Dice around 0.7 for DL vs\n0.33 for FreeSurfer). Axial-MLP is competitive with U-Nets even though it is\nslightly less accurate. The conclusions of our paper are two-fold: 1) the\nstudied deep learning methods could be useful tools to study CP in large\ncohorts of MS patients; 2)~Axial-MLP is a potentially viable alternative to\nconvolutional neural networks for such tasks, although it could benefit from\nfurther improvements.",

In practice, the\ncorrection can be added as an integrated term (i.e. in the model resolvent) or\ndirectly inside the tendencies of the physical model. The resolvent correction\nis easy to implement. The tendency correction is more technical, in particular\nit requires the adjoint of the physical model, but also more flexible. We use\nthe two-scale Lorenz model to compare the two methods. The accuracy in\nlong-range forecast experiments is somewhat similar between the surrogate\nmodels using the resolvent correction and the tendency correction. By contrast,\nthe surrogate models using the tendency correction significantly outperform the\nsurrogate models using the resolvent correction in data assimilation\nexperiments.

We study a wide range of\nparametric and nonparametric target distributions under a host of objective\nevaluation metrics. We investigate how to obtain valid statistical guarantees\nfor GANs through the lens of regularization. On the nonparametric end, we\nderive the optimal minimax rates for distribution estimation under the\nadversarial framework. On the parametric end, we establish a theory for general\nneural network classes (including deep leaky ReLU networks) that characterizes\nthe interplay on the choice of generator and discriminator pair. We discover\nand isolate a new notion of regularization, called the\ngenerator-discriminator-pair regularization, that sheds light on the advantage\nof GANs compared to classical parametric and nonparametric approaches for\nexplicit distribution estimation. We develop novel oracle inequalities as the\nmain technical tools for analyzing GANs, which are of independent interest.",

          "description": "The bias-variance trade-off is a central concept in supervised learning. In\nclassical statistics, increasing the complexity of a model (e.g., number of\nparameters) reduces bias but also increases variance. Until recently, it was\ncommonly believed that optimal performance is achieved at intermediate model\ncomplexities which strike a balance between bias and variance. Modern Deep\nLearning methods flout this dogma, achieving state-of-the-art performance using\n\"over-parameterized models\" where the number of fit parameters is large enough\nto perfectly fit the training data. As a result, understanding bias and\nvariance in over-parameterized models has emerged as a fundamental problem in\nmachine learning. Here, we use methods from statistical physics to derive\nanalytic expressions for bias and variance in two minimal models of\nover-parameterization (linear regression and two-layer neural networks with\nnonlinear data distributions), allowing us to disentangle properties stemming\nfrom the model architecture and random sampling of data. In both models,\nincreasing the number of fit parameters leads to a phase transition where the\ntraining error goes to zero and the test error diverges as a result of the\nvariance (while the bias remains finite). Beyond this threshold in the\ninterpolation regime, the training error remains zero while the test error\ndecreases. We also show that in contrast with classical intuition,\nover-parameterized models can overfit even in the absence of noise and exhibit\nbias even if the student and teacher models match. We synthesize these results\nto construct a holistic understanding of generalization error and the\nbias-variance trade-off in over-parameterized models and relate our results to\nrandom matrix theory.",

          "description": "Contrastive Learning (CL) is one of the most popular self-supervised learning\nframeworks for graph representation learning, which trains a Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) by discriminating positive and negative node pairs. However,\nthere are two challenges for CL on graphs. On the one hand, traditional CL\nmethods will unavoidably introduce semantic errors since they will treat some\nsemantically similar nodes as negative pairs. On the other hand, most of the\nexisting CL methods ignore the multiplexity nature of the real-world graphs,\nwhere nodes are connected by various relations and each relation represents a\nview of the graph. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Graph\nMulti-View Prototypical (Graph-MVP) framework to extract node embeddings on\nmultiplex graphs. Firstly, we introduce a Graph Prototypical Contrastive\nLearning (Graph-PCL) framework to capture both node-level and semantic-level\ninformation for each view of multiplex graphs. Graph-PCL captures the\nnode-level information by a simple yet effective data transformation technique.\nIt captures the semantic-level information by an Expectation-Maximization (EM)\nalgorithm, which alternatively performs clustering over node embeddings and\nparameter updating for GNN. Next, we introduce Graph-MVP based on Graph-PCL to\njointly model different views of the multiplex graphs. Our key insight behind\nGraph-MVP is that different view-specific embeddings of the same node should\nhave similar underlying semantic, based on which we propose two versions of\nGraph-MVP: Graph-MVP_hard and Graph-MVP_soft to align embeddings across views.\nFinally, we evaluate the proposed Graph-PCL and Graph-MVP on a variety of\nreal-world datasets and downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed Graph-PCL and Graph-MVP frameworks.",

          "description": "The emergence of Industry 4.0 is making production systems more flexible and\nalso more dynamic. In these settings, schedules often need to be adapted in\nreal-time by dispatching rules. Although substantial progress was made until\nthe '90s, the performance of these rules is still rather limited. The machine\nlearning literature is developing a variety of methods to improve them, but the\nresulting rules are difficult to interpret and do not generalise well for a\nwide range of settings. This paper is the first major attempt at combining\nmachine learning with domain problem reasoning for scheduling. The idea\nconsists of using the insights obtained with the latter to guide the empirical\nsearch of the former. Our hypothesis is that this guided empirical learning\nprocess should result in dispatching rules that are effective and interpretable\nand which generalise well to different instance classes. We test our approach\nin the classical dynamic job shop scheduling problem minimising tardiness,\nwhich is one of the most well-studied scheduling problems. Nonetheless, results\nsuggest that our approach was able to find new state-of-the-art rules, which\nsignificantly outperform the existing literature in the vast majority of\nsettings, from loose to tight due dates and from low utilisation conditions to\ncongested shops. Overall, the average improvement is 19%. Moreover, the rules\nare compact, interpretable, and generalise well to extreme, unseen scenarios.",

          "description": "Object manipulation from 3D visual inputs poses many challenges on building\ngeneralizable perception and policy models. However, 3D assets in existing\nbenchmarks mostly lack the diversity of 3D shapes that align with real-world\nintra-class complexity in topology and geometry. Here we propose SAPIEN\nManipulation Skill Benchmark (ManiSkill) to benchmark manipulation skills over\ndiverse objects in a full-physics simulator. 3D assets in ManiSkill include\nlarge intra-class topological and geometric variations. Tasks are carefully\nchosen to cover distinct types of manipulation challenges. Latest progress in\n3D vision also makes us believe that we should customize the benchmark so that\nthe challenge is inviting to researchers working on 3D deep learning. To this\nend, we simulate a moving panoramic camera that returns ego-centric point\nclouds or RGB-D images. In addition, we would like ManiSkill to serve a broad\nset of researchers interested in manipulation research. Besides supporting the\nlearning of policies from interactions, we also support\nlearning-from-demonstrations (LfD) methods, by providing a large number of\nhigh-quality demonstrations (~36,000 successful trajectories, ~1.5M point\ncloud/RGB-D frames in total). We provide baselines using 3D deep learning and\nLfD algorithms. All code of our benchmark (simulator, environment, SDK, and\nbaselines) is open-sourced, and a challenge facing interdisciplinary\nresearchers will be held based on the benchmark.",

          "description": "Knowledge Distillation (KD), which transfers the knowledge of a well-trained\nlarge model (teacher) to a small model (student), has become an important area\nof research for practical deployment of recommender systems. Recently, Relaxed\nRanking Distillation (RRD) has shown that distilling the ranking information in\nthe recommendation list significantly improves the performance. However, the\nmethod still has limitations in that 1) it does not fully utilize the\nprediction errors of the student model, which makes the training not fully\nefficient, and 2) it only distills the user-side ranking information, which\nprovides an insufficient view under the sparse implicit feedback. This paper\npresents Dual Correction strategy for Distillation (DCD), which transfers the\nranking information from the teacher model to the student model in a more\nefficient manner. Most importantly, DCD uses the discrepancy between the\nteacher model and the student model predictions to decide which knowledge to be\ndistilled. By doing so, DCD essentially provides the learning guidance tailored\nto \"correcting\" what the student model has failed to accurately predict. This\nprocess is applied for transferring the ranking information from the user-side\nas well as the item-side to address sparse implicit user feedback. Our\nexperiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art\nbaselines, and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component.",

          "description": "In high-stakes applications of data-driven decision making like healthcare,\nit is of paramount importance to learn a policy that maximizes the reward while\navoiding potentially dangerous actions when there is uncertainty. There are two\nmain challenges usually associated with this problem. Firstly, learning through\nonline exploration is not possible due to the critical nature of such\napplications. Therefore, we need to resort to observational datasets with no\ncounterfactuals. Secondly, such datasets are usually imperfect, additionally\ncursed with missing values in the attributes of features. In this paper, we\nconsider the problem of constructing personalized policies using logged data\nwhen there are missing values in the attributes of features in both training\nand test data. The goal is to recommend an action (treatment) when $\\Xt$, a\ndegraded version of $\\Xb$ with missing values, is observed. We consider three\nstrategies for dealing with missingness. In particular, we introduce the\n\\textit{conservative strategy} where the policy is designed to safely handle\nthe uncertainty due to missingness. In order to implement this strategy we need\nto estimate posterior distribution $p(\\Xb|\\Xt)$, we use variational autoencoder\nto achieve this. In particular, our method is based on partial variational\nautoencoders (PVAE) which are designed to capture the underlying structure of\nfeatures with missing values.",

          "description": "In this paper, the problem of minimizing the weighted sum of age of\ninformation (AoI) and total energy consumption of Internet of Things (IoT)\ndevices is studied. In the considered model, each IoT device monitors a\nphysical process that follows nonlinear dynamics. As the dynamics of the\nphysical process vary over time, each device must find an optimal sampling\nfrequency to sample the real-time dynamics of the physical system and send\nsampled information to a base station (BS). Due to limited wireless resources,\nthe BS can only select a subset of devices to transmit their sampled\ninformation. Thus, edge devices must cooperatively sample their monitored\ndynamics based on the local observations and the BS must collect the sampled\ninformation from the devices immediately, hence avoiding the additional time\nand energy used for sampling and information transmission. To this end, it is\nnecessary to jointly optimize the sampling policy of each device and the device\nselection scheme of the BS so as to accurately monitor the dynamics of the\nphysical process using minimum energy. This problem is formulated as an\noptimization problem whose goal is to minimize the weighted sum of AoI cost and\nenergy consumption. To solve this problem, we propose a novel distributed\nreinforcement learning (RL) approach for the sampling policy optimization. The\nproposed algorithm enables edge devices to cooperatively find the global\noptimal sampling policy using their own local observations. Given the sampling\npolicy, the device selection scheme can be optimized thus minimizing the\nweighted sum of AoI and energy consumption of all devices. Simulations with\nreal data of PM 2.5 pollution show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the\nsum of AoI by up to 17.8% and 33.9% and the total energy consumption by up to\n13.2% and 35.1%, compared to a conventional deep Q network method and a uniform\nsampling policy.",

The performance of DexRay evaluated\non over 158k apps demonstrates that, while simple, our approach is effective\nwith a high detection rate(F1-score= 0.96). Finally, we investigate the impact\nof time decay and image-resizing on the performance of DexRay and assess its\nresilience to obfuscation.

In this paper, we\npropose two timescale hybrid federated learning (TT-HF), which migrates to a\nmore distributed topology via device-to-device (D2D) communications. In TT-HF,\nlocal model training occurs at devices via successive gradient iterations, and\nthe synchronization process occurs at two timescales: (i) macro-scale, where\nglobal aggregations are carried out via device-server interactions, and (ii)\nmicro-scale, where local aggregations are carried out via D2D cooperative\nconsensus formation in different device clusters. Our theoretical analysis\nreveals how device, cluster, and network-level parameters affect the\nconvergence of TT-HF, and leads to a set of conditions under which a\nconvergence rate of O(1/t) is guaranteed.

          "description": "In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, one of the key questions\nis how to deal with the high noise level existing in physical quantum bits\n(qubits). Quantum error correction is promising but requires an extensive\nnumber (e.g., over 1,000) of physical qubits to create one \"perfect\" qubit,\nexceeding the capacity of the existing quantum computers. This paper aims to\ntackle the noise issue from another angle: instead of creating perfect qubits\nfor general quantum algorithms, we investigate the potential to mitigate the\nnoise issue for dedicate algorithms. Specifically, this paper targets quantum\nneural network (QNN), and proposes to learn the errors in the training phase,\nso that the identified QNN model can be resilient to noise. As a result, the\nimplementation of QNN needs no or a small number of additional physical qubits,\nwhich is more realistic for the near-term quantum computers. To achieve this\ngoal, an application-specific compiler is essential: on the one hand, the error\ncannot be learned if the mapping from logical qubits to physical qubits exists\nrandomness; on the other hand, the compiler needs to be efficient so that the\nlengthy training procedure can be completed in a reasonable time. In this\npaper, we utilize the recent QNN framework, QuantumFlow, as a case study.\nExperimental results show that the proposed approach can optimize QNN models\nfor different errors in qubits, achieving up to 28% accuracy improvement\ncompared with the model obtained by the error-agnostic training.",

Compared with standard federated learning (FL) approaches\nthat focus on decomposable minimization objectives, FDAM is more complicated\ndue to its minimization objective is non-decomposable over individual examples.\nIn this paper, we propose improved FDAM algorithms for heterogeneous data by\nsolving the popular non-convex strongly-concave min-max formulation of DAM in a\ndistributed fashion, which can also be applied to a class of non-convex\nstrongly-concave min-max problems. A striking result of this paper is that the\ncommunication complexity of the proposed algorithm is a constant independent of\nthe number of machines and also independent of the accuracy level, which\nimproves an existing result by orders of magnitude.

          "description": "The consumption of tobacco has reached global epidemic proportions and is\ncharacterized as the leading cause of death and illness. Among the different\nways of consuming tobacco (e.g., smokeless, cigars), smoking cigarettes is the\nmost widespread. In this paper, we present a two-step, bottom-up algorithm\ntowards the automatic and objective monitoring of cigarette-based, smoking\nbehavior during the day, using the 3D acceleration and orientation velocity\nmeasurements from a commercial smartwatch. In the first step, our algorithm\nperforms the detection of individual smoking gestures (i.e., puffs) using an\nartificial neural network with both convolutional and recurrent layers. In the\nsecond step, we make use of the detected puff density to achieve the temporal\nlocalization of smoking sessions that occur throughout the day. In the\nexperimental section we provide extended evaluation regarding each step of the\nproposed algorithm, using our publicly available, realistic Smoking Event\nDetection (SED) and Free-living Smoking Event Detection (SED-FL) datasets\nrecorded under semi-controlled and free-living conditions, respectively. In\nparticular, leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) experiments reveal an F1-score of\n0.863 for the detection of puffs and an F1-score/Jaccard index equal to\n0.878/0.604 towards the temporal localization of smoking sessions during the\nday.

          "description": "Neuroimaging biomarkers that distinguish between typical brain aging and\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) are valuable for determining how much each contributes\nto cognitive decline. Machine learning models can derive multi-variate brain\nchange patterns related to the two processes, including the SPARE-AD (Spatial\nPatterns of Atrophy for Recognition of Alzheimer's Disease) and SPARE-BA (of\nBrain Aging) investigated herein. However, substantial overlap between brain\nregions affected in the two processes confounds measuring them independently.\nWe present a methodology toward disentangling the two.

First, a subset of AD patients and CN adults were selected based\npurely on clinical diagnoses to train SPARE-BA1 (regression of age using CN\nindividuals) and SPARE-AD1 (classification of CN versus AD). Second, analogous\ngroups were selected based on clinical and molecular markers to train SPARE-BA2\nand SPARE-AD2: amyloid-positive (A+) AD continuum group (consisting of A+AD,\nA+MCI, and A+ and tau-positive CN individuals) and amyloid-negative (A-) CN\ngroup. Finally, the combined group of the AD continuum and A-/CN individuals\nwas used to train SPARE-BA3, with the intention to estimate brain age\nregardless of AD-related brain changes. Disentangled SPARE models derived brain\npatterns that were more specific to the two types of the brain changes.\nCorrelation between the SPARE-BA and SPARE-AD was significantly reduced.\nCorrelation of disentangled SPARE-AD was non-inferior to the molecular\nmeasurements and to the number of APOE4 alleles, but was less to AD-related\npsychometric test scores, suggesting contribution of advanced brain aging to\nthese scores.",

          "description": "Over-the-air computation (OAC) is a promising technique to realize fast model\naggregation in the uplink of federated edge learning. OAC, however, hinges on\naccurate channel-gain precoding and strict synchronization among the edge\ndevices, which are challenging in practice. As such, how to design the maximum\nlikelihood (ML) estimator in the presence of residual channel-gain mismatch and\nasynchronies is an open problem. To fill this gap, this paper formulates the\nproblem of misaligned OAC for federated edge learning and puts forth a whitened\nmatched filtering and sampling scheme to obtain oversampled, but independent,\nsamples from the misaligned and overlapped signals. Given the whitened samples,\na sum-product ML estimator and an aligned-sample estimator are devised to\nestimate the arithmetic sum of the transmitted symbols. In particular, the\ncomputational complexity of our sum-product ML estimator is linear in the\npacket length and hence is significantly lower than the conventional ML\nestimator. Extensive simulations on the test accuracy versus the average\nreceived energy per symbol to noise power spectral density ratio (EsN0) yield\ntwo main results: 1) In the low EsN0 regime, the aligned-sample estimator can\nachieve superior test accuracy provided that the phase misalignment is\nnon-severe. In contrast, the ML estimator does not work well due to the error\npropagation and noise enhancement in the estimation process. 2) In the high\nEsN0 regime, the ML estimator attains the optimal learning performance\nregardless of the severity of phase misalignment. On the other hand, the\naligned-sample estimator suffers from a test-accuracy loss caused by phase\nmisalignment.",

          "description": "Improving speed and image quality of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) via\nnovel reconstruction approaches remains one of the highest impact applications\nfor deep learning in medical imaging. The fastMRI dataset, unique in that it\ncontains large volumes of raw MRI data, has enabled significant advances in\naccelerating MRI using deep learning-based reconstruction methods. While the\nimpact of the fastMRI dataset on the field of medical imaging is unquestioned,\nthe dataset currently lacks clinical expert pathology annotations, critical to\naddressing clinically relevant reconstruction frameworks and exploring\nimportant questions regarding rendering of specific pathology using such novel\napproaches. This work introduces fastMRI+, which consists of 16154\nsubspecialist expert bounding box annotations and 13 study-level labels for 22\ndifferent pathology categories on the fastMRI knee dataset, and 7570\nsubspecialist expert bounding box annotations and 643 study-level labels for 30\ndifferent pathology categories for the fastMRI brain dataset. The fastMRI+\ndataset is open access and aims to support further research and advancement of\nmedical imaging in MRI reconstruction and beyond.",

          "description": "Explanations shed light on a machine learning model's rationales and can aid\nin identifying deficiencies in its reasoning process. Explanation generation\nmodels are typically trained in a supervised way given human explanations. When\nsuch annotations are not available, explanations are often selected as those\nportions of the input that maximise a downstream task's performance, which\ncorresponds to optimising an explanation's Faithfulness to a given model.\nFaithfulness is one of several so-called diagnostic properties, which prior\nwork has identified as useful for gauging the quality of an explanation without\nrequiring annotations. Other diagnostic properties are Data Consistency, which\nmeasures how similar explanations are for similar input instances, and\nConfidence Indication, which shows whether the explanation reflects the\nconfidence of the model. In this work, we show how to directly optimise for\nthese diagnostic properties when training a model to generate sentence-level\nexplanations, which markedly improves explanation quality, agreement with human\nrationales, and downstream task performance on three complex reasoning tasks.",

          "description": "Speech pre-training has primarily demonstrated efficacy on classification\ntasks, while its capability of generating novel speech, similar to how GPT-2\ncan generate coherent paragraphs, has barely been explored. Generative Spoken\nLanguage Modeling (GSLM) (Lakhotia et al., 2021) is the only prior work\naddressing the generative aspects of speech pre-training, which replaces text\nwith discovered phone-like units for language modeling and shows the ability to\ngenerate meaningful novel sentences. Unfortunately, despite eliminating the\nneed of text, the units used in GSLM discard most of the prosodic information.\nHence, GSLM fails to leverage prosody for better comprehension, and does not\ngenerate expressive speech. In this work, we present a prosody-aware generative\nspoken language model (pGSLM). It is composed of a multi-stream transformer\nlanguage model (MS-TLM) of speech, represented as discovered unit and prosodic\nfeature streams, and an adapted HiFi-GAN model converting MS-TLM outputs to\nwaveforms. We devise a series of metrics for prosody modeling and generation,\nand re-use metrics from GSLM for content modeling. Experimental results show\nthat the pGSLM can utilize prosody to improve both prosody and content\nmodeling, and also generate natural, meaningful, and coherent speech given a\nspoken prompt.

          "description": "We consider the use of Gaussian process (GP) priors for solving inverse\nproblems in a Bayesian framework. As is well known, the computational\ncomplexity of GPs scales cubically in the number of datapoints. We here show\nthat in the context of inverse problems involving integral operators, one faces\nadditional difficulties that hinder inversion on large grids. Furthermore, in\nthat context, covariance matrices can become too large to be stored. By\nleveraging results about sequential disintegrations of Gaussian measures, we\nare able to introduce an implicit representation of posterior covariance\nmatrices that reduces the memory footprint by only storing low rank\nintermediate matrices, while allowing individual elements to be accessed\non-the-fly without needing to build full posterior covariance matrices.\nMoreover, it allows for fast sequential inclusion of new observations. These\nfeatures are crucial when considering sequential experimental design tasks. We\ndemonstrate our approach by computing sequential data collection plans for\nexcursion set recovery for a gravimetric inverse problem, where the goal is to\nprovide fine resolution estimates of high density regions inside the Stromboli\nvolcano, Italy. Sequential data collection plans are computed by extending the\nweighted integrated variance reduction (wIVR) criterion to inverse problems.\nOur results show that this criterion is able to significantly reduce the\nuncertainty on the excursion volume, reaching close to minimal levels of\nresidual uncertainty. Overall, our techniques allow the advantages of\nprobabilistic models to be brought to bear on large-scale inverse problems\narising in the natural sciences.",

          "description": "The annotation of domain experts is important for some medical applications\nwhere the objective groundtruth is ambiguous to define, e.g., the\nrehabilitation for some chronic diseases, and the prescreening of some\nmusculoskeletal abnormalities without further medical examinations. However,\nimproper uses of the annotations may hinder developing reliable models. On one\nhand, forcing the use of a single groundtruth generated from multiple\nannotations is less informative for the modeling. On the other hand, feeding\nthe model with all the annotations without proper regularization is noisy given\nexisting disagreements. For such issues, we propose a novel agreement learning\nframework to tackle the challenge of learning from multiple annotators without\nobjective groundtruth. The framework has two streams, with one stream fitting\nwith the multiple annotators and the other stream learning agreement\ninformation between the annotators. In particular, the agreement learning\nstream produces regularization information to the classifier stream, tuning its\ndecision to be better in line with the agreement between the annotators. The\nproposed method can be easily plugged to existing backbones developed with\nmajority-voted groundtruth or multiple annotations. Thereon, experiments on two\nmedical datasets demonstrate improved agreement levels with annotators.",

          "description": "Ultrasonic imaging is being used to obtain information about the acoustic\nproperties of a medium by emitting waves into it and recording their\ninteraction using ultrasonic transducer arrays. The Delay-And-Sum (DAS)\nalgorithm forms images using the main path on which reflected signals travel\nback to the transducers. In some applications, different insonification paths\ncan be considered, for instance by placing the transducers at different\nlocations or if strong reflectors inside the medium are known a-priori. These\ndifferent modes give rise to multiple DAS images reflecting different geometric\ninformation about the scatterers and the challenge is to either fuse them into\none image or to directly extract higher-level information regarding the\nmaterials of the medium, e.g., a segmentation map. Traditional image fusion\ntechniques typically use ad-hoc combinations of pre-defined image transforms,\npooling operations and thresholding. In this work, we propose a deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) architecture that directly maps all available data to a\nsegmentation map while explicitly incorporating the DAS image formation for the\ndifferent insonification paths as network layers. This enables information flow\nbetween data pre-processing and image post-processing DNNs, trained end-to-end.\nWe compare our proposed method to a traditional image fusion technique using\nsimulated data experiments, mimicking a non-destructive testing application\nwith four image modes, i.e., two transducer locations and two internal\nreflection boundaries. Using our approach, it is possible to obtain much more\naccurate segmentation of defects.",

          "description": "Accurately forecasting ridesourcing demand is important for effective\ntransportation planning and policy-making. With the rise of Artificial\nIntelligence (AI), researchers have started to utilize machine learning models\nto forecast travel demand, which, in many cases, can produce higher prediction\naccuracy than statistical models. However, most existing machine-learning\nstudies used a global model to predict the demand and ignored the influence of\nspatial heterogeneity (i.e., the spatial variations in the impacts of\nexplanatory variables). Spatial heterogeneity can drive the parameter\nestimations varying over space; failing to consider the spatial variations may\nlimit the model's prediction performance. To account for spatial heterogeneity,\nthis study proposes a Clustering-aided Ensemble Method (CEM) to forecast the\nzone-to-zone (census-tract-to-census-tract) travel demand for ridesourcing\nservices. Specifically, we develop a clustering framework to split the\norigin-destination pairs into different clusters and ensemble the\ncluster-specific machine learning models for prediction. We implement and test\nthe proposed methodology by using the ridesourcing-trip data in Chicago. The\nresults show that, with a more transparent and flexible model structure, the\nCEM significantly improves the prediction accuracy than the benchmark models\n(i.e., global machine-learning and statistical models directly trained on all\nobservations).

          "description": "As online shopping prevails and e-commerce platforms emerge, there is a\ntremendous number of parcels being transported every day. Thus, it is crucial\nfor the logistics industry on how to assign a candidate logistics route for\neach shipping parcel properly as it leaves a significant impact on the total\nlogistics cost optimization and business constraints satisfaction such as\ntransit hub capacity and delivery proportion of delivery providers. This online\nroute-assignment problem can be viewed as a constrained online decision-making\nproblem. Notably, the large amount (beyond ${10^5}$) of daily parcels, the\nvariability and non-Markovian characteristics of parcel information impose\ndifficulties on attaining (near-) optimal solution without violating\nconstraints excessively. In this paper, we develop a model-free DRL approach\nnamed PPO-RA, in which Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is improved with\ndedicated techniques to address the challenges for route assignment (RA). The\nactor and critic networks use attention mechanism and parameter sharing to\naccommodate each incoming parcel with varying numbers and identities of\ncandidate routes, without modeling non-Markovian parcel arriving dynamics since\nwe make assumption of i.i.d. parcel arrival. We use recorded delivery parcel\ndata to evaluate the performance of PPO-RA by comparing it with widely-used\nbaselines via simulation. The results show the capability of the proposed\napproach to achieve considerable cost savings while satisfying most\nconstraints.",

Affordable sensors are available and the industry is in the process of\nintroducing and extending monitoring solutions to improve product quality.\nOften, no expertise of how much data is required for a certain task (e.g.\nmonitoring) exists. Especially in vital machinery, a trend to exaggerated\nsensors may be noticed, both in quality and in quantity.

          "description": "Numerical simulation of multiphase flow in porous media is essential for many\ngeoscience applications. However, due to the multi-physics, non-linear, and\nmulti-scale problem nature, these simulations are very expensive at desirable\ngrid resolutions, and the computational cost often impedes rigorous engineering\ndecision-making. Machine learning methods provide faster alternatives to\ntraditional simulators by training neural network models with numerical\nsimulation data mappings. Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN)-based\nmodels are accurate yet data-intensive and are prone to overfitting. Here we\npresent a new architecture, U-FNO, an enhanced Fourier neural operator for\nsolving the multiphase flow problem. The U-FNO is designed based on the Fourier\nneural operator (FNO) that learns an integral kernel in the Fourier space.\nThrough a systematic comparison among a CNN benchmark and three types of FNO\nvariations on a CO2-water multiphase problem in the context of CO2 geological\nstorage, we show that the U-FNO architecture has the advantages of both\ntraditional CNN and original FNO, providing significantly more accurate and\nefficient performance than previous architectures. The trained U-FNO provides\ngas saturation and pressure buildup predictions with a 10,000 times speedup\ncompared to traditional numerical simulators while maintaining similar\naccuracy.",

We derive\nempirical estimators for the associated higher order maximum mean discrepancies\n(MMDs) and prove consistency.

In addition, leveraging our higher order MMDs we construct a family\nof universal kernels on stochastic processes that allows to solve real-world\ncalibration and optimal stopping problems in quantitative finance (such as the\npricing of American options) via classical kernel-based regression methods.\nFinally, adapting existing tests for conditional independence to the case of\nstochastic processes, we design a causal-discovery algorithm to recover the\ncausal graph of structural dependencies among interacting bodies solely from\nobservations of their multidimensional trajectories.",

          "description": "Vector space models for symbolic processing that encode symbols by random\nvectors have been proposed in cognitive science and connectionist communities\nunder the names Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA), and, synonymously,\nHyperdimensional (HD) computing. In this paper, we generalize VSAs to function\nspaces by mapping continuous-valued data into a vector space such that the\ninner product between the representations of any two data points represents a\nsimilarity kernel. By analogy to VSA, we call this new function encoding and\ncomputing framework Vector Function Architecture (VFA). In VFAs, vectors can\nrepresent individual data points as well as elements of a function space (a\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space). The algebraic vector operations, inherited\nfrom VSA, correspond to well-defined operations in function space. Furthermore,\nwe study a previously proposed method for encoding continuous data, fractional\npower encoding (FPE), which uses exponentiation of a random base vector to\nproduce randomized representations of data points and fulfills the kernel\nproperties for inducing a VFA. We show that the distribution from which\nelements of the base vector are sampled determines the shape of the FPE kernel,\nwhich in turn induces a VFA for computing with band-limited functions. In\nparticular, VFAs provide an algebraic framework for implementing large-scale\nkernel machines with random features, extending Rahimi and Recht, 2007.\nFinally, we demonstrate several applications of VFA models to problems in image\nrecognition, density estimation and nonlinear regression. Our analyses and\nresults suggest that VFAs constitute a powerful new framework for representing\nand manipulating functions in distributed neural systems, with myriad\napplications in artificial intelligence.",

          "description": "In plane-wave imaging, multiple unfocused ultrasound waves are transmitted\ninto a medium of interest from different angles and an image is formed from the\nrecorded reflections. The number of plane waves used leads to a trade-off\nbetween frame-rate and image quality, with single-plane-wave (SPW) imaging\nbeing the fastest possible modality with the worst image quality. Recently,\ndeep learning methods have been proposed to improve ultrasound imaging. One\napproach is to use image-to-image networks that work on the formed image and\nanother is to directly learn a mapping from data to an image. Both approaches\nutilize purely data-driven models and require deep, expressive network\narchitectures, combined with large numbers of training samples to obtain good\nresults. Here, we propose a data-to-image architecture that incorporates a\nwave-physics-based image formation algorithm in-between deep convolutional\nneural networks. To achieve this, we implement the Fourier (FK) migration\nmethod as network layers and train the whole network end-to-end. We compare our\nproposed data-to-image network with an image-to-image network in simulated data\nexperiments, mimicking a medical ultrasound application. Experiments show that\nit is possible to obtain high-quality SPW images, almost similar to an image\nformed using 75 plane waves over an angular range of $\\pm$16$^\\circ$. This\nillustrates the great potential of combining deep neural networks with\nphysics-based image formation algorithms for SPW imaging.",

The approach is validated by reconstructing unsheared\ntactile images from sheared images and showing they match unsheared tactile\nimages collected with no sliding motion. In addition, the unsheared tactile\nimages give a faithful reconstruction of the contact geometry that is not\npossible from the sheared data, and robust estimation of the contact pose that\ncan be used for servo control sliding around various 2D shapes. Finally, the\ncontact geometry reconstruction in conjunction with servo control sliding were\nused for faithful full object reconstruction of various 2D shapes.

          "description": "The application of graph neural networks (GNNs) to the domain of electrical\npower grids has high potential impact on smart grid monitoring. Even though\nthere is a natural correspondence of power flow to message-passing in GNNs,\ntheir performance on power grids is not well-understood. We argue that there is\na gap between GNN research driven by benchmarks which contain graphs that\ndiffer from power grids in several important aspects. Additionally, inductive\nlearning of GNNs across multiple power grid topologies has not been explored\nwith real-world data. We address this gap by means of (i) defining power grid\ngraph datasets in inductive settings, (ii) an exploratory analysis of graph\nproperties, and (iii) an empirical study of the concrete learning task of state\nestimation on real-world power grids. Our results show that GNNs are more\nrobust to noise with up to 400% lower error compared to baselines. Furthermore,\ndue to the unique properties of electrical grids, we do not observe the well\nknown over-smoothing phenomenon of GNNs and find the best performing models to\nbe exceptionally deep with up to 13 layers. This is in stark contrast to\nexisting benchmark datasets where the consensus is that 2 to 3 layer GNNs\nperform best.

          "description": "In the past years, significant improvements in the field of neural\narchitecture search(NAS) have been made. However, it is still challenging to\nsearch for efficient networks due to the gap between the searched constraint\nand real inference time exists. To search for a high-performance network with\nlow inference time, several previous works set a computational complexity\nconstraint for the search algorithm. However, many factors affect the speed of\ninference(e.g., FLOPs, MACs). The correlation between a single indicator and\nthe latency is not strong. Currently, some re-parameterization(Rep) techniques\nare proposed to convert multi-branch to single-path architecture which is\ninference-friendly. Nevertheless, multi-branch architectures are still\nhuman-defined and inefficient. In this work, we propose a new search space that\nis suitable for structural re-parameterization techniques. RepNAS, a one-stage\nNAS approach, is present to efficiently search the optimal diverse branch\nblock(ODBB) for each layer under the branch number constraint. Our experimental\nresults show the searched ODBB can easily surpass the manual diverse branch\nblock(DBB) with efficient training. Code and models will be available sooner.",

          "description": "Industrial applications of machine learning face unique challenges due to the\nnature of raw industry data. Preprocessing and preparing raw industrial data\nfor machine learning applications is a demanding task that often takes more\ntime and work than the actual modeling process itself and poses additional\nchallenges. This paper addresses one of those challenges, specifically, the\nchallenge of missing values due to sensor unavailability at different\nproduction units of nonlinear production lines. In cases where only a small\nproportion of the data is missing, those missing values can often be imputed.\nIn cases of large proportions of missing data, imputing is often not feasible,\nand removing observations containing missing values is often the only option.\nThis paper presents a technique, that allows to utilize all of the available\ndata without the need of removing large amounts of observations where data is\nonly partially available. We do not only discuss the principal idea of the\npresented method, but also show different possible implementations that can be\napplied depending on the data at hand. Finally, we demonstrate the application\nof the presented method with data from a steel production plant.",

This approach\novercomes the challenge of memory restriction of graphics processing units and\nits consequences on the choice of batch size, and convergence. Compared to\nconvolutional neural networks, the proposed deep learning methodology provides\nfreedom to select larger batch sizes, due to reducing significantly the size of\nnetwork inputs.

We investigate the effect of\ndifferent components of our neural network on its performance. We compare our\ndeep learning strategy with a convolutional neural network from various\nperspectives, specifically for maximum possible batch size. We inspect the\ngeneralizability of our network by predicting the permeability of real-world\nrock samples as well as synthetic digital rocks that are statistically\ndifferent from the samples used during training.

          "description": "Previous versions of sparse principal component analysis (PCA) have presumed\nthat the eigen-basis (a $p \\times k$ matrix) is approximately sparse. We\npropose a method that presumes the $p \\times k$ matrix becomes approximately\nsparse after a $k \\times k$ rotation. The simplest version of the algorithm\ninitializes with the leading $k$ principal components. Then, the principal\ncomponents are rotated with an $k \\times k$ orthogonal rotation to make them\napproximately sparse. Finally, soft-thresholding is applied to the rotated\nprincipal components. This approach differs from prior approaches because it\nuses an orthogonal rotation to approximate a sparse basis. One consequence is\nthat a sparse component need not to be a leading eigenvector, but rather a\nmixture of them. In this way, we propose a new (rotated) basis for sparse PCA.\nIn addition, our approach avoids \"deflation\" and multiple tuning parameters\nrequired for that. Our sparse PCA framework is versatile; for example, it\nextends naturally to a two-way analysis of a data matrix for simultaneous\ndimensionality reduction of rows and columns. We provide evidence showing that\nfor the same level of sparsity, the proposed sparse PCA method is more stable\nand can explain more variance compared to alternative methods.

To this end, there has\nbeen a growing surge of interest to learn simultaneously from multiple training\ndomains - while enforcing different types of invariance across those domains.\nYet, all existing approaches fail to show systematic benefits under fair\nevaluation protocols. In this paper, we propose a new learning scheme to\nenforce domain invariance in the space of the gradients of the loss function:\nspecifically, we introduce a regularization term that matches the domain-level\nvariances of gradients across training domains. Critically, our strategy, named\nFishr, exhibits close relations with the Fisher Information and the Hessian of\nthe loss. We show that forcing domain-level gradient covariances to be similar\nduring the learning procedure eventually aligns the domain-level loss\nlandscapes locally around the final weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of Fishr for out-of-distribution generalization. In\nparticular, Fishr improves the state of the art on the DomainBed benchmark and\nperforms significantly better than Empirical Risk Minimization.

          "description": "The fault diagnostic model trained for a laboratory case machine fails to\nperform well on the industrial machines running under variable operating\nconditions. For every new operating condition of such machines, a new\ndiagnostic model has to be trained which is a time-consuming and uneconomical\nprocess. Therefore, we propose a quick learning mechanism that can transform\nthe existing diagnostic model into a new model suitable for industrial machines\noperating in different conditions. The proposed method uses the Net2Net\ntransformation followed by a fine-tuning to cancel/minimize the maximum mean\ndiscrepancy between the new data and the previous one. The fine-tuning of the\nmodel requires a very less amount of labelled target samples and very few\niterations of training. Therefore, the proposed method is capable of learning\nthe new target data pattern quickly. The effectiveness of the proposed fault\ndiagnosis method has been demonstrated on the Case Western Reserve University\ndataset, Intelligent Maintenance Systems bearing dataset, and Paderborn\nuniversity dataset under the wide variations of the operating conditions. It\nhas been validated that the diagnostic model trained on artificially damaged\nfault datasets can be used to quickly train another model for a real damage\ndataset.",

In this\npaper, we propose a novel meta-learning based SSL algorithm (Meta-Semi) that\nrequires tuning only one additional hyper-parameter, compared with a standard\nsupervised deep learning algorithm, to achieve competitive performance under\nvarious conditions of SSL. We start by defining a meta optimization problem\nthat minimizes the loss on labeled data through dynamically reweighting the\nloss on unlabeled samples, which are associated with soft pseudo labels during\ntraining. As the meta problem is computationally intensive to solve directly,\nwe propose an efficient algorithm to dynamically obtain the approximate\nsolutions. We show theoretically that Meta-Semi converges to the stationary\npoint of the loss function on labeled data under mild conditions.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet fast heuristic to\napproximate the Jeffreys divergence between two univariate Gaussian mixtures\nwith arbitrary number of components. Our heuristic relies on converting the\nmixtures into pairs of dually parameterized probability densities belonging to\nan exponential family. In particular, we consider the versatile polynomial\nexponential family densities, and design a divergence to measure in closed-form\nthe goodness of fit between a Gaussian mixture and its polynomial exponential\ndensity approximation. This goodness-of-fit divergence is a generalization of\nthe Hyv\\\"arinen divergence used to estimate models with computationally\nintractable normalizers. It allows us to perform model selection by choosing\nthe orders of the polynomial exponential densities used to approximate the\nmixtures. We demonstrate experimentally that our heuristic to approximate the\nJeffreys divergence improves by several orders of magnitude the computational\ntime of stochastic Monte Carlo estimations while approximating reasonably well\nthe Jeffreys divergence, specially when the mixtures have a very small number\nof modes.

A transformation\nfunction is employed to mask parts of EEG signals and force the generator to\nsynthesize potential EEG signals based on the remaining parts, to produce a\nwide variety of samples. The masking possibility during transformation is\nintroduced as prior knowledge to guide to extract distinguishable features for\nsimulated EEG signals and generalize the classifier to the augmented sample\nspace. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed method can help\nemotion recognition for performance gain and achieve state-of-the-art results.",

Dedicated experiments\nhave been conducted to verify the feasibility and robustness of the OdoNet. The\nresults indicate that the IMU individuality, the vehicle loads, and the road\nconditions have little impact on the robustness and precision of the OdoNet,\nwhile the IMU biases and the mounting angles may notably ruin the OdoNet. Thus,\na data-cleaning procedure is added to effectively mitigate the impacts of the\nIMU biases and the mounting angles. Compared to the process using only\nnon-holonomic constraint (NHC), after employing the pseudo-odometer, the\npositioning error is reduced by around 68%, while the percentage is around 74%\nfor the hardware wheeled odometer.

Many\nrecent analyses adopt graph convolutional networks, to study non-linear\ninteractions between functionally-correlated states. However, although patterns\nof brain activation are known to be hierarchically organised in both space and\ntime, many methods have failed to extract powerful spatio-temporal features. To\novercome those challenges, and improve understanding of long-range functional\ndynamics, we translate an approach, from the domain of skeleton-based action\nrecognition, designed to model interactions across space and time. We evaluate\nthis approach using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset on sex\nclassification and fluid intelligence prediction. To account for subject\ntopographic variability of functional organisation, we modelled functional\nconnectomes using multi-resolution dual-regressed (subject-specific) ICA nodes.\nResults show a prediction accuracy of 94.4% for sex classification (an increase\nof 6.2% compared to other methods), and an improvement of correlation with\nfluid intelligence of 0.325 vs 0.144, relative to a baseline model that encodes\nspace and time separately.

          "description": "Graph-Laplacians and their spectral embeddings play an important role in\nmultiple areas of machine learning. This paper is focused on graph-Laplacian\ndimension reduction for the spectral clustering of data as a primary\napplication. Spectral embedding provides a low-dimensional parametrization of\nthe data manifold which makes the subsequent task (e.g., clustering) much\neasier. However, despite reducing the dimensionality of data, the overall\ncomputational cost may still be prohibitive for large data sets due to two\nfactors. First, computing the partial eigendecomposition of the graph-Laplacian\ntypically requires a large Krylov subspace. Second, after the spectral\nembedding is complete, one still has to operate with the same number of data\npoints. For example, clustering of the embedded data is typically performed\nwith various relaxations of k-means which computational cost scales poorly with\nrespect to the size of data set. In this work, we switch the focus from the\nentire data set to a subset of graph vertices (target subset). We develop two\nnovel algorithms for such low-dimensional representation of the original graph\nthat preserves important global distances between the nodes of the target\nsubset. In particular, it allows to ensure that target subset clustering is\nconsistent with the spectral clustering of the full data set if one would\nperform such. That is achieved by a properly parametrized reduced-order model\n(ROM) of the graph-Laplacian that approximates accurately the diffusion\ntransfer function of the original graph for inputs and outputs restricted to\nthe target subset. Working with a small target subset reduces greatly the\nrequired dimension of Krylov subspace and allows to exploit the conventional\nalgorithms (like approximations of k-means) in the regimes when they are most\nrobust and efficient.",

          "description": "Radiologists today play a key role in making diagnostic decisions and\nlabeling images for training A.I. algorithms. Low inter-reader reliability\n(IRR) can be seen between experts when interpreting challenging cases. While\nteams-based decisions are known to outperform individual decisions,\ninter-personal biases often creep up in group interactions which limit\nnon-dominant participants from expressing true opinions. To overcome the dual\nproblems of low consensus and inter-personal bias, we explored a solution\nmodeled on biological swarms of bees. Two separate cohorts; three radiologists\nand five radiology residents collaborated on a digital swarm platform in real\ntime and in a blinded fashion, grading meniscal lesions on knee MR exams. These\nconsensus votes were benchmarked against clinical (arthroscopy) and\nradiological (senior-most radiologist) observations. The IRR of the consensus\nvotes was compared to the IRR of the majority and most confident votes of the\ntwo cohorts.The radiologist cohort saw an improvement of 23% in IRR of swarm\nvotes over majority vote. Similar improvement of 23% in IRR in 3-resident swarm\nvotes over majority vote, was observed. The 5-resident swarm had an even higher\nimprovement of 32% in IRR over majority vote. Swarm consensus votes also\nimproved specificity by up to 50%. The swarm consensus votes outperformed\nindividual and majority vote decisions in both the radiologists and resident\ncohorts. The 5-resident swarm had higher IRR than 3-resident swarm indicating\npositive effect of increased swarm size. The attending and resident swarms also\noutperformed predictions from a state-of-the-art A.I. algorithm. Utilizing a\ndigital swarm platform improved agreement and allows participants to express\njudgement free intent, resulting in superior clinical performance and robust\nA.I. training labels.",

          "description": "Prediction of Overall Survival (OS) of brain cancer patients from multi-modal\nMRI is a challenging field of research. Most of the existing literature on\nsurvival prediction is based on Radiomic features, which does not consider\neither non-biological factors or the functional neurological status of the\npatient(s). Besides, the selection of an appropriate cut-off for survival and\nthe presence of censored data create further problems. Application of deep\nlearning models for OS prediction is also limited due to the lack of large\nannotated publicly available datasets. In this scenario we analyse the\npotential of two novel neuroimaging feature families, extracted from brain\nparcellation atlases and spatial habitats, along with classical radiomic and\ngeometric features; to study their combined predictive power for analysing\noverall survival. A cross validation strategy with grid search is proposed to\nsimultaneously select and evaluate the most predictive feature subset based on\nits predictive power. A Cox Proportional Hazard (CoxPH) model is employed for\nunivariate feature selection, followed by the prediction of patient-specific\nsurvival functions by three multivariate parsimonious models viz. Coxnet,\nRandom survival forests (RSF) and Survival SVM (SSVM). The brain cancer MRI\ndata used for this research was taken from two open-access collections TCGA-GBM\nand TCGA-LGG available from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Corresponding\nsurvival data for each patient was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas\n(TCGA). A high cross validation $C-index$ score of $0.82\\pm.10$ was achieved\nusing RSF with the best $24$ selected features. Age was found to be the most\nimportant biological predictor. There were $9$, $6$, $6$ and $2$ features\nselected from the parcellation, habitat, radiomic and region-based feature\ngroups respectively.",

          "description": "Prescriptive process monitoring is a family of techniques to optimize the\nperformance of a business process by triggering interventions at runtime.\nExisting prescriptive process monitoring techniques assume that the number of\ninterventions that may be triggered is unbounded. In practice, though, specific\ninterventions consume resources with finite capacity. For example, in a loan\norigination process, an intervention may consist of preparing an alternative\nloan offer to increase the applicant's chances of taking a loan. This\nintervention requires a certain amount of time from a credit officer, and thus,\nit is not possible to trigger this intervention in all cases. This paper\nproposes a prescriptive process monitoring technique that triggers\ninterventions to optimize a cost function under fixed resource constraints. The\nproposed technique relies on predictive modeling to identify cases that are\nlikely to lead to a negative outcome, in combination with causal inference to\nestimate the effect of an intervention on the outcome of the case. These\noutputs are then used to allocate resources to interventions to maximize a cost\nfunction. A preliminary empirical evaluation suggests that the proposed\napproach produces a higher net gain than a purely predictive (non-causal)\nbaseline.",

The deadly virus has spread across the world, taking part in the\nglobal pandemic disease since March 2020. In addition, a recent variant of\nSARS-CoV-2 named Delta is intractably contagious and responsible for more than\nfour million deaths over the world. Therefore, it is vital to possess a\nself-testing service of SARS-CoV-2 at home. In this study, we introduce\nFruit-CoV, a two-stage vision framework, which is capable of detecting\nSARS-CoV-2 infections through recorded cough sounds. Specifically, we convert\nsounds into Log-Mel Spectrograms and use the EfficientNet-V2 network to extract\nits visual features in the first stage. In the second stage, we use 14\nconvolutional layers extracted from the large-scale Pretrained Audio Neural\nNetworks for audio pattern recognition (PANNs) and the Wavegram-Log-Mel-CNN to\naggregate feature representations of the Log-Mel Spectrograms. Finally, we use\nthe combined features to train a binary classifier. In this study, we use a\ndataset provided by the AICovidVN 115M Challenge, which includes a total of\n7371 recorded cough sounds collected throughout Vietnam, India, and\nSwitzerland. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves an AUC\nscore of 92.8% and ranks the 1st place on the leaderboard of the AICovidVN\nChallenge. More importantly, our proposed framework can be integrated into a\ncall center or a VoIP system to speed up detecting SARS-CoV-2 infections\nthrough online/recorded cough sounds.",

Existing federated learning approaches usually adopt a\nsingle global model to capture the shared knowledge of all users by aggregating\ntheir gradients, regardless of the discrepancy between their data\ndistributions. However, due to the diverse nature of user behaviors, assigning\nusers' gradients to different global models (i.e., centers) can better capture\nthe heterogeneity of data distributions across users. Our paper proposes a\nnovel multi-center aggregation mechanism for federated learning, which learns\nmultiple global models from the non-IID user data and simultaneously derives\nthe optimal matching between users and centers. We formulate the problem as a\njoint optimization that can be efficiently solved by a stochastic expectation\nmaximization (EM) algorithm.

          "description": "Image classification is a major application domain for conventional deep\nlearning (DL). Quantum machine learning (QML) has the potential to\nrevolutionize image classification. In any typical DL-based image\nclassification, we use convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features\nfrom the image and multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) to create the actual\ndecision boundaries. On one hand, QML models can be useful in both of these\ntasks. Convolution with parameterized quantum circuits (Quanvolution) can\nextract rich features from the images. On the other hand, quantum neural\nnetwork (QNN) models can create complex decision boundaries. Therefore,\nQuanvolution and QNN can be used to create an end-to-end QML model for image\nclassification. Alternatively, we can extract image features separately using\nclassical dimension reduction techniques such as, Principal Components Analysis\n(PCA) or Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) and use the extracted features to\ntrain a QNN. We review two proposals on quantum-classical hybrid ML models for\nimage classification namely, Quanvolutional Neural Network and dimension\nreduction using a classical algorithm followed by QNN. Particularly, we make a\ncase for trainable filters in Quanvolution and CAE-based feature extraction for\nimage datasets (instead of dimension reduction using linear transformations\nsuch as, PCA).

We are successful in identifying\nPareto-optimal designs, which can reduce the storage overhead of the DNN by\n~30MB for a quality loss of less than 0.5%. To enable low-cost embedded DNNs,\nBioNetExplorer also employs different model compression techniques to further\nreduce the storage overhead of the network by up to 53x for a quality loss of\n<0.2%.",

          "description": "Operational networks are increasingly using machine learning models for a\nvariety of tasks, including detecting anomalies, inferring application\nperformance, and forecasting demand. Accurate models are important, yet\naccuracy can degrade over time due to concept drift, whereby either the\ncharacteristics of the data change over time (data drift) or the relationship\nbetween the features and the target predictor change over time (model drift).\nDrift is important to detect because changes in properties of the underlying\ndata or relationships to the target prediction can require model retraining,\nwhich can be time-consuming and expensive. Concept drift occurs in operational\nnetworks for a variety of reasons, ranging from software upgrades to\nseasonality to changes in user behavior. Yet, despite the prevalence of drift\nin networks, its extent and effects on prediction accuracy have not been\nextensively studied. This paper presents an initial exploration into concept\ndrift in a large cellular network in the United States for a major metropolitan\narea in the context of demand forecasting. We find that concept drift arises\nlargely due to data drift, and it appears across different key performance\nindicators (KPIs), models, training set sizes, and time intervals. We identify\nthe sources of concept drift for the particular problem of forecasting downlink\nvolume. Weekly and seasonal patterns introduce both high and low-frequency\nmodel drift, while disasters and upgrades result in sudden drift due to\nexogenous shocks. Regions with high population density, lower traffic volumes,\nand higher speeds also tend to correlate with more concept drift. The features\nthat contribute most significantly to concept drift are User Equipment (UE)\ndownlink packets, UE uplink packets, and Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)\ntotal received packets.",

          "description": "The accuracy of DL classifiers is unstable in that it often changes\nsignificantly when retested on adversarial images, imperfect images, or\nperturbed images. This paper adds to the small but fundamental body of work on\nbenchmarking the robustness of DL classifiers on defective images. Unlike\nexisted single-factor digital perturbation work, we provide state-of-the-art\ntwo-factor perturbation that provides two natural perturbations on images\napplied in different sequences. The two-factor perturbation includes (1) two\ndigital perturbations (Salt & pepper noise and Gaussian noise) applied in both\nsequences. (2) one digital perturbation (salt & pepper noise) and a geometric\nperturbation (rotation) applied in different sequences. To measure robust DL\nclassifiers, previous scientists provided 15 types of single-factor corruption.\nWe created 69 benchmarking image sets, including a clean set, sets with single\nfactor perturbations, and sets with two-factor perturbation conditions. To be\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first report that two-factor perturbed\nimages improves both robustness and accuracy of DL classifiers. Previous\nresearch evaluating deep learning (DL) classifiers has often used top-1/top-5\naccuracy, so researchers have usually offered tables, line diagrams, and bar\ncharts to display accuracy of DL classifiers. But these existed approaches\ncannot quantitively evaluate robustness of DL classifiers. We innovate a new\ntwo-dimensional, statistical visualization tool, including mean accuracy and\ncoefficient of variation (CV), to benchmark the robustness of DL classifiers.\nAll source codes and related image sets are shared on websites\n(this http URL or\nhttps://github.com/daiweiworking/RobustDeepLearningUsingPerturbations ) to\nsupport future academic research and industry projects.",

          "description": "Recursive least squares (RLS) algorithms were once widely used for training\nsmall-scale neural networks, due to their fast convergence. However, previous\nRLS algorithms are unsuitable for training deep neural networks (DNNs), since\nthey have high computational complexity and too many preconditions. In this\npaper, to overcome these drawbacks, we propose three novel RLS optimization\nalgorithms for training feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural\nnetworks and recurrent neural networks (including long short-term memory\nnetworks), by using the error backpropagation and our average-approximation RLS\nmethod, together with the equivalent gradients of the linear least squares loss\nfunction with respect to the linear outputs of hidden layers. Compared with\nprevious RLS optimization algorithms, our algorithms are simple and elegant.\nThey can be viewed as an improved stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm,\nwhich uses the inverse autocorrelation matrix of each layer as the adaptive\nlearning rate. Their time and space complexities are only several times those\nof SGD. They only require the loss function to be the mean squared error and\nthe activation function of the output layer to be invertible. In fact, our\nalgorithms can be also used in combination with other first-order optimization\nalgorithms without requiring these two preconditions. In addition, we present\ntwo improved methods for our algorithms.

Moreover, Pano3D\nmoves beyond typical intra-dataset evaluation to inter-dataset performance\nassessment. By disentangling the capacity to generalize to unseen data into\ndifferent test splits, Pano3D represents a holistic benchmark for $360^o$ depth\nestimation. We use it as a basis for an extended analysis seeking to offer\ninsights into classical choices for depth estimation.

          "description": "Existing road pothole detection approaches can be classified as computer\nvision-based or machine learning-based. The former approaches typically employ\n2-D image analysis/understanding or 3-D point cloud modeling and segmentation\nalgorithms to detect road potholes from vision sensor data. The latter\napproaches generally address road pothole detection using convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) in an end-to-end manner. However, road potholes are not\nnecessarily ubiquitous and it is challenging to prepare a large well-annotated\ndataset for CNN training. In this regard, while computer vision-based methods\nwere the mainstream research trend in the past decade, machine learning-based\nmethods were merely discussed. Recently, we published the first stereo\nvision-based road pothole detection dataset and a novel disparity\ntransformation algorithm, whereby the damaged and undamaged road areas can be\nhighly distinguished. However, there are no benchmarks currently available for\nstate-of-the-art (SoTA) CNNs trained using either disparity images or\ntransformed disparity images. Therefore, in this paper, we first discuss the\nSoTA CNNs designed for semantic segmentation and evaluate their performance for\nroad pothole detection with extensive experiments. Additionally, inspired by\ngraph neural network (GNN), we propose a novel CNN layer, referred to as graph\nattention layer (GAL), which can be easily deployed in any existing CNN to\noptimize image feature representations for semantic segmentation. Our\nexperiments compare GAL-DeepLabv3+, our best-performing implementation, with\nnine SoTA CNNs on three modalities of training data: RGB images, disparity\nimages, and transformed disparity images. The experimental results suggest that\nour proposed GAL-DeepLabv3+ achieves the best overall pothole detection\naccuracy on all training data modalities.",

We\nexpand the variational autoencoder collaborative filtering from a single-domain\nto a multi-domain setting. The intuition is that user-item interactions in a\nsource domain can augment the recommendation quality in a target domain. The\nintuition can be taken to its extreme, where, in a cross-domain setup, the user\nhistory in a source domain is enough to generate high-quality recommendations\nin a target one. We thus create a Product-of-Experts (POE) architecture for\nrecommendations that jointly models user-item interactions across multiple\ndomains. The method is resilient to missing data for one or more of the\ndomains, which is a situation often found in real life. We present results on\ntwo widely-used datasets - Amazon and Yelp, which support the claim that\nholistic user preference knowledge leads to better recommendations.\nSurprisingly, we find that in some cases, a POE recommender that does not\naccess the target domain user representation can surpass a strong VAE\nrecommender baseline trained on the target domain.",

          "description": "Many of the challenges facing today's reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms,\nsuch as robustness, generalization, transfer, and computational efficiency are\nclosely related to compression. Prior work has convincingly argued why\nminimizing information is useful in the supervised learning setting, but\nstandard RL algorithms lack an explicit mechanism for compression. The RL\nsetting is unique because (1) its sequential nature allows an agent to use past\ninformation to avoid looking at future observations and (2) the agent can\noptimize its behavior to prefer states where decision making requires few bits.\nWe take advantage of these properties to propose a method (RPC) for learning\nsimple policies. This method brings together ideas from information\nbottlenecks, model-based RL, and bits-back coding into a simple and\ntheoretically-justified algorithm. Our method jointly optimizes a latent-space\nmodel and policy to be self-consistent, such that the policy avoids states\nwhere the model is inaccurate. We demonstrate that our method achieves much\ntighter compression than prior methods, achieving up to 5x higher reward than a\nstandard information bottleneck. We also demonstrate that our method learns\npolicies that are more robust and generalize better to new tasks.",

To improve the discriminating ability of learned deep\nrepresentations and deep coefficients, our network clearly considers enriching\nthe supervised prior by the joint deep coefficients-regularized label\nprediction, and incorporates enriched prior information as additional label and\nstructure constraints. The label constraint can enable the samples of the same\nlabel to have the same coordinate in the new feature space, while the structure\nconstraint forces the coefficient matrices in each layer to be block-diagonal\nso that the enhanced prior using the self-expressive label propagation are more\naccurate.

          "description": "Label noise will degenerate the performance of deep learning algorithms\nbecause deep neural networks easily overfit label errors. Let X and Y denote\nthe instance and clean label, respectively. When Y is a cause of X, according\nto which many datasets have been constructed, e.g., SVHN and CIFAR, the\ndistributions of P(X) and P(Y|X) are entangled. This means that the\nunsupervised instances are helpful to learn the classifier and thus reduce the\nside effect of label noise. However, it remains elusive on how to exploit the\ncausal information to handle the label noise problem. In this paper, by\nleveraging a structural causal model, we propose a novel generative approach\nfor instance-dependent label-noise learning. In particular, we show that\nproperly modeling the instances will contribute to the identifiability of the\nlabel noise transition matrix and thus lead to a better classifier.\nEmpirically, our method outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on both\nsynthetic and real-world label-noise datasets.",

Variance reduction for\nthese algorithms has become an important research topic. In contrast to common\napproaches, which rarely leverage global models of the objective function, we\nexploit convexity and L-smoothness to improve the noisy estimates outputted by\nthe stochastic gradient oracle. Our method, named COCO denoiser, is the joint\nmaximum likelihood estimator of multiple function gradients from their noisy\nobservations, subject to co-coercivity constraints between them. The resulting\nestimate is the solution of a convex Quadratically Constrained Quadratic\nProblem. Although this problem is expensive to solve by interior point methods,\nwe exploit its structure to apply an accelerated first-order algorithm, the\nFast Dual Proximal Gradient method. Besides analytically characterizing the\nproposed estimator, we show empirically that increasing the number and\nproximity of the queried points leads to better gradient estimates.

          "description": "In this paper, we investigate the problem about how to bid in repeated\ncontextual first price auctions. We consider a single bidder (learner) who\nrepeatedly bids in the first price auctions: at each time $t$, the learner\nobserves a context $x_t\\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ and decides the bid based on\nhistorical information and $x_t$. We assume a structured linear model of the\nmaximum bid of all the others $m_t = \\alpha_0\\cdot x_t + z_t$, where\n$\\alpha_0\\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is unknown to the learner and $z_t$ is randomly\nsampled from a noise distribution $\\mathcal{F}$ with log-concave density\nfunction $f$. We consider both \\emph{binary feedback} (the learner can only\nobserve whether she wins or not) and \\emph{full information feedback} (the\nlearner can observe $m_t$) at the end of each time $t$. For binary feedback,\nwhen the noise distribution $\\mathcal{F}$ is known, we propose a bidding\nalgorithm, by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method to achieve at\nmost $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\log(d) T})$ regret. Moreover, we generalize this\nalgorithm to the setting with binary feedback and the noise distribution is\nunknown but belongs to a parametrized family of distributions. For the full\ninformation feedback with \\emph{unknown} noise distribution, we provide an\nalgorithm that achieves regret at most $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{dT})$. Our approach\ncombines an estimator for log-concave density functions and then MLE method to\nlearn the noise distribution $\\mathcal{F}$ and linear weight $\\alpha_0$\nsimultaneously.

          "description": "Random effect models are popular statistical models for detecting and\ncorrecting spurious sample correlations due to hidden confounders in\ngenome-wide gene expression data. In applications where some confounding\nfactors are known, estimating simultaneously the contribution of known and\nlatent variance components in random effect models is a challenge that has so\nfar relied on numerical gradient-based optimizers to maximize the likelihood\nfunction. This is unsatisfactory because the resulting solution is poorly\ncharacterized and the efficiency of the method may be suboptimal. Here we prove\nanalytically that maximum-likelihood latent variables can always be chosen\northogonal to the known confounding factors, in other words, that\nmaximum-likelihood latent variables explain sample covariances not already\nexplained by known factors. Based on this result we propose a restricted\nmaximum-likelihood method which estimates the latent variables by maximizing\nthe likelihood on the restricted subspace orthogonal to the known confounding\nfactors, and show that this reduces to probabilistic PCA on that subspace. The\nmethod then estimates the variance-covariance parameters by maximizing the\nremaining terms in the likelihood function given the latent variables, using a\nnewly derived analytic solution for this problem. Compared to gradient-based\noptimizers, our method attains greater or equal likelihood values, can be\ncomputed using standard matrix operations, results in latent factors that don't\noverlap with any known factors, and has a runtime reduced by several orders of\nmagnitude. Hence the restricted maximum-likelihood method facilitates the\napplication of random effect modelling strategies for learning latent variance\ncomponents to much larger gene expression datasets than possible with current\nmethods.",

          "description": "The role of social media in opinion formation has far-reaching implications\nin all spheres of society. Though social media provide platforms for expressing\nnews and views, it is hard to control the quality of posts due to the sheer\nvolumes of posts on platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Misinformation and\nrumours have lasting effects on society, as they tend to influence people's\nopinions and also may motivate people to act irrationally. It is therefore very\nimportant to detect and remove rumours from these platforms. The only way to\nprevent the spread of rumours is through automatic detection and classification\nof social media posts. Our focus in this paper is the Twitter social medium, as\nit is relatively easy to collect data from Twitter. The majority of previous\nstudies used supervised learning approaches to classify rumours on Twitter.\nThese approaches rely on feature extraction to obtain both content and context\nfeatures from the text of tweets to distinguish rumours and non-rumours.\nManually extracting features however is time-consuming considering the volume\nof tweets. We propose a novel approach to deal with this problem by utilising\nsentence embedding using BERT to identify rumours on Twitter, rather than the\nusual feature extraction techniques. We use sentence embedding using BERT to\nrepresent each tweet's sentences into a vector according to the contextual\nmeaning of the tweet. We classify those vectors into rumours or non-rumours by\nusing various supervised learning techniques. Our BERT based models improved\nthe accuracy by approximately 10% as compared to previous methods.",

Instead of evaluating handcrafted\nfeatures and raw waveforms independently, this paper proposes an Auxiliary\nRawnet model to complement handcrafted features with features learned from raw\nwaveforms. A key benefit of the approach is that it can improve accuracy at a\nrelatively low computational cost. The proposed Auxiliary Rawnet model is\ntested using the ASVspoof 2019 dataset and the results from this dataset\nindicate that a light-weight waveform encoder can potentially boost the\nperformance of handcrafted-features-based encoders in exchange for a small\namount of additional computational work.",

          "description": "Toxic comment classification models are often found biased toward identity\nterms which are terms characterizing a specific group of people such as\n\"Muslim\" and \"black\". Such bias is commonly reflected in false-positive\npredictions, i.e. non-toxic comments with identity terms. In this work, we\npropose a novel approach to tackle such bias in toxic comment classification,\nleveraging the notion of subjectivity level of a comment and the presence of\nidentity terms. We hypothesize that when a comment is made about a group of\npeople that is characterized by an identity term, the likelihood of that\ncomment being toxic is associated with the subjectivity level of the comment,\ni.e. the extent to which the comment conveys personal feelings and opinions.\nBuilding upon the BERT model, we propose a new structure that is able to\nleverage these features, and thoroughly evaluate our model on 4 datasets of\nvarying sizes and representing different social media platforms. The results\nshow that our model can consistently outperform BERT and a SOTA model devised\nto address identity term bias in a different way, with a maximum improvement in\nF1 of 2.43% and 1.91% respectively.",

          "description": "In a cloud of m-dimensional data points, how would we spot, as well as rank,\nboth single-point- as well as group- anomalies? We are the first to generalize\nanomaly detection in two dimensions: The first dimension is that we handle both\npoint-anomalies, as well as group-anomalies, under a unified view -- we shall\nrefer to them as generalized anomalies. The second dimension is that gen2Out\nnot only detects, but also ranks, anomalies in suspiciousness order. Detection,\nand ranking, of anomalies has numerous applications: For example, in EEG\nrecordings of an epileptic patient, an anomaly may indicate a seizure; in\ncomputer network traffic data, it may signify a power failure, or a DoS/DDoS\nattack. We start by setting some reasonable axioms; surprisingly, none of the\nearlier methods pass all the axioms. Our main contribution is the gen2Out\nalgorithm, that has the following desirable properties: (a) Principled and\nSound anomaly scoring that obeys the axioms for detectors, (b) Doubly-general\nin that it detects, as well as ranks generalized anomaly -- both point- and\ngroup-anomalies, (c) Scalable, it is fast and scalable, linear on input size.\n(d) Effective, experiments on real-world epileptic recordings (200GB)\ndemonstrate effectiveness of gen2Out as confirmed by clinicians. Experiments on\n27 real-world benchmark datasets show that gen2Out detects ground truth groups,\nmatches or outperforms point-anomaly baseline algorithms on accuracy, with no\ncompetition for group-anomalies and requires about 2 minutes for 1 million data\npoints on a stock machine.",

          "description": "Small magnitude earthquakes are the most abundant but the most difficult to\nlocate robustly and well due to their low amplitudes and high frequencies\nusually obscured by heterogeneous noise sources. They highlight crucial\ninformation about the stress state and the spatio-temporal behavior of fault\nsystems during the earthquake cycle, therefore, its full characterization is\nthen crucial for improving earthquake hazard assessment. Modern DL algorithms\nalong with the increasing computational power are exploiting the continuously\ngrowing seismological databases, allowing scientists to improve the\ncompleteness for earthquake catalogs, systematically detecting smaller\nmagnitude earthquakes and reducing the errors introduced mainly by human\nintervention. In this work, we introduce OKSP, a novel automatic earthquake\ndetection pipeline for seismic monitoring in Costa Rica. Using Kabre\nsupercomputer from the Costa Rica High Technology Center, we applied OKSP to\nthe day before and the first 5 days following the Puerto Armuelles, M6.5,\nearthquake that occurred on 26 June, 2019, along the Costa Rica-Panama border\nand found 1100 more earthquakes previously unidentified by the Volcanological\nand Seismological Observatory of Costa Rica. From these events, a total of 23\nearthquakes with magnitudes below 1.0 occurred a day to hours prior to the\nmainshock, shedding light about the rupture initiation and earthquake\ninteraction leading to the occurrence of this productive seismic sequence. Our\nobservations show that for the study period, the model was 100% exhaustive and\n82% precise, resulting in an F1 score of 0.90. This effort represents the very\nfirst attempt for automatically detecting earthquakes in Costa Rica using deep\nlearning methods and demonstrates that, in the near future, earthquake\nmonitoring routines will be carried out entirely by AI algorithms.",

          "description": "Voice assistants, such as smart speakers, have exploded in popularity. It is\ncurrently estimated that the smart speaker adoption rate has exceeded 35% in\nthe US adult population. Manufacturers have integrated speaker identification\ntechnology, which attempts to determine the identity of the person speaking, to\nprovide personalized services to different members of the same family. Speaker\nidentification can also play an important role in controlling how the smart\nspeaker is used. For example, it is not critical to correctly identify the user\nwhen playing music. However, when reading the user's email out loud, it is\ncritical to correctly verify the speaker that making the request is the\nauthorized user. Speaker verification systems, which authenticate the speaker\nidentity, are therefore needed as a gatekeeper to protect against various\nspoofing attacks that aim to impersonate the enrolled user. This paper compares\npopular learnable front-ends which learn the representations of audio by joint\ntraining with downstream tasks (End-to-End). We categorize the front-ends by\ndefining two generic architectures and then analyze the filtering stages of\nboth types in terms of learning constraints. We propose replacing fixed\nfilterbanks with a learnable layer that can better adapt to anti-spoofing\ntasks. The proposed FastAudio front-end is then tested with two popular\nback-ends to measure the performance on the LA track of the ASVspoof 2019\ndataset. The FastAudio front-end achieves a relative improvement of 27% when\ncompared with fixed front-ends, outperforming all other learnable front-ends on\nthis task.",

To bridge this\ngap, we propose to exploit low-dimensional geometric structures of the real\nworld data sets. We establish theoretical guarantees of convolutional residual\nnetworks (ConvResNet) in terms of function approximation and statistical\nestimation for binary classification. Specifically, given the data lying on a\n$d$-dimensional manifold isometrically embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^D$, we prove\nthat if the network architecture is properly chosen, ConvResNets can (1)\napproximate Besov functions on manifolds with arbitrary accuracy, and (2) learn\na classifier by minimizing the empirical logistic risk, which gives an excess\nrisk in the order of $n^{-\\frac{s}{2s+2(s\\vee d)}}$, where $s$ is a smoothness\nparameter. This implies that the sample complexity depends on the intrinsic\ndimension $d$, instead of the data dimension $D$.

          "description": "Deep neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable to backdoor, or trojan,\nattacks where an adversary has embedded a trigger in the network at training\ntime such that the model correctly classifies all standard inputs, but\ngenerates a targeted, incorrect classification on any input which contains the\ntrigger. In this paper, we present the first ultra light-weight and highly\neffective trojan detection method that does not require access to the\ntraining/test data, does not involve any expensive computations, and makes no\nassumptions on the nature of the trojan trigger. Our approach focuses on\nanalysis of the weights of the final, linear layer of the network. We\nempirically demonstrate several characteristics of these weights that occur\nfrequently in trojaned networks, but not in benign networks. In particular, we\nshow that the distribution of the weights associated with the trojan target\nclass is clearly distinguishable from the weights associated with other\nclasses. Using this, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed detection\nmethod against state-of-the-art attacks across a variety of architectures,\ndatasets, and trigger types.",

          "description": "Individual mobility prediction is an essential task for transportation demand\nmanagement and traffic system operation. There exist a large body of works on\nmodeling location sequence and predicting the next location of users; however,\nlittle attention is paid to the prediction of the next trip, which is governed\nby the strong spatiotemporal dependencies between diverse attributes, including\ntrip start time $t$, origin $o$, and destination $d$. To fill this gap, in this\npaper we propose a novel point process-based model -- Attentive Marked temporal\npoint processes (AMTPP) -- to model human mobility and predict the whole trip\n$(t,o,d)$ in a joint manner. To encode the influence of history trips, AMTPP\nemploys the self-attention mechanism with a carefully designed positional\nembedding to capture the daily/weekly periodicity and regularity in individual\ntravel behavior. Given the unique peaked nature of inter-event time in human\nbehavior, we use an asymmetric log-Laplace mixture distribution to precisely\nmodel the distribution of trip start time $t$. Furthermore, an\norigin-destination (OD) matrix learning block is developed to model the\nrelationship between every origin and destination pair. Experimental results on\ntwo large metro trip datasets demonstrate the superior performance of AMTPP.",

EHR data,\nsequential records of a patient's interactions with healthcare systems, has\nnumerous inherent characteristics of temporality, irregularity and data\ninsufficiency. Some recent works train healthcare predictive models by making\nuse of sequential information in EHR data, but they are vulnerable to\nirregular, temporal EHR data with the states of admission/discharge from\nhospital, and insufficient data. To mitigate this, we propose an end-to-end\nrobust transformer-based model called SETOR, which exploits neural ordinary\ndifferential equation to handle both irregular intervals between a patient's\nvisits with admitted timestamps and length of stay in each visit, to alleviate\nthe limitation of insufficient data by integrating medical ontology, and to\ncapture the dependencies between the patient's visits by employing multi-layer\ntransformer blocks. Experiments conducted on two real-world healthcare datasets\nshow that, our sequential diagnoses prediction model SETOR not only achieves\nbetter predictive results than previous state-of-the-art approaches,\nirrespective of sufficient or insufficient training data, but also derives more\ninterpretable embeddings of medical codes.

          "description": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) bring the power of deep representation learning\nto graph and relational data and achieve state-of-the-art performance in many\napplications. GNNs compute node representations by taking into account the\ntopology of the node's ego-network and the features of the ego-network's nodes.\nWhen the nodes do not have high-quality features, GNNs learn an embedding layer\nto compute node embeddings and use them as input features. However, the size of\nthe embedding layer is linear to the product of the number of nodes in the\ngraph and the dimensionality of the embedding and does not scale to big data\nand graphs with hundreds of millions of nodes. To reduce the memory associated\nwith this embedding layer, hashing-based approaches, commonly used in\napplications like NLP and recommender systems, can potentially be used.\nHowever, a direct application of these ideas fails to exploit the fact that in\nmany real-world graphs, nodes that are topologically close will tend to be\nrelated to each other (homophily) and as such their representations will be\nsimilar.\n\nIn this work, we present approaches that take advantage of the nodes'\nposition in the graph to dramatically reduce the memory required, with minimal\nif any degradation in the quality of the resulting GNN model. Our approaches\ndecompose a node's embedding into two components: a position-specific component\nand a node-specific component. The position-specific component models homophily\nand the node-specific component models the node-to-node variation. Extensive\nexperiments using different datasets and GNN models show that our methods are\nable to reduce the memory requirements by 88% to 97% while achieving, in nearly\nall cases, better classification accuracy than other competing approaches,\nincluding the full embeddings.",

To achieve better performance with fewer\ntrainable parameters, recent methods are proposed to go shallower by parameter\nsharing or model compressing along with the depth. However, weak modeling\ncapacity limits their performance. Contrastively, going wider by inducing more\ntrainable matrixes and parameters would produce a huge model requiring advanced\nparallelism to train and inference.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a parameter-efficient framework, going wider\ninstead of deeper.

To maximize modeling capacity, we scale along model width by\nreplacing feed-forward network (FFN) with mixture-of-experts (MoE).

Various methods have\nbeen proposed to address it via leveraging the advantages of graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs) or multi-task learning.

How to obtain a unified embedding for a user from hyper meta-paths\nand avoid the previously mentioned limitations simultaneously is critical.\nThanks to the recent success of graph contrastive learning, we leverage it to\nlearn embeddings of user behavior patterns adaptively instead of assigning a\nfixed scheme to understand the dependencies among different behaviors.

Training such inference models is challenging\ndue to the lack of paired (shape, program) data in most domains. A popular\napproach is to pre-train a model on synthetic data and then fine-tune on real\nshapes using slow, unstable reinforcement learning. In this paper, we argue\nthat self-training is a viable alternative for fine-tuning such models.\nSelf-training is a semi-supervised learning paradigm where a model assigns\npseudo-labels to unlabeled data, and then retrains with (data, pseudo-label)\npairs as the new ground truth. We show that for constructive solid geometry and\nassembly-based modeling, self-training outperforms state-of-the-art\nreinforcement learning approaches. Additionally, shape program inference has a\nunique property that circumvents a potential downside of self-training\n(incorrect pseudo-label assignment): inferred programs are executable. For a\ngiven shape from our distribution of interest $\\mathbf{x}^*$ and its predicted\nprogram $\\mathbf{z}$, one can execute $\\mathbf{z}$ to obtain a shape\n$\\mathbf{x}$ and train on $(\\mathbf{z}, \\mathbf{x})$ pairs, rather than\n$(\\mathbf{z}, \\mathbf{x}^*)$ pairs. We term this procedure latent execution\nself training (LEST).

          "description": "Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive and economical technique to\nextract vital signs of the human body. Although it has been widely used in\nconsumer and research grade wrist devices to track a user's physiology, the PPG\nsignal is very sensitive to motion which can corrupt the signal's quality.\nExisting Motion Artifact (MA) reduction techniques have been developed and\nevaluated using either synthetic noisy signals or signals collected during\nhigh-intensity activities - both of which are difficult to generalize for\nreal-life scenarios. Therefore, it is valuable to collect realistic PPG signals\nwhile performing Activities of Daily Living (ADL) to develop practical signal\ndenoising and analysis methods. In this work, we propose an automatic pseudo\nclean PPG generation process for reliable PPG signal selection. For each noisy\nPPG segment, the corresponding pseudo clean PPG reduces the MAs and contains\nrich temporal details depicting cardiac features. Our experimental results show\nthat 71% of the pseudo clean PPG collected from ADL can be considered as high\nquality segment where the derived MAE of heart rate and respiration rate are\n1.46 BPM and 3.93 BrPM, respectively. Therefore, our proposed method can\ndetermine the reliability of the raw noisy PPG by considering quality of the\ncorresponding pseudo clean PPG signal.",

          "description": "In a regular open set detection problem, samples of known classes (also\ncalled closed set classes) are used to train a special classifier. In testing,\nthe classifier can (1) classify the test samples of known classes to their\nrespective classes and (2) also detect samples that do not belong to any of the\nknown classes (we say they belong to some unknown or open set classes). This\npaper studies the problem of zero-shot open-set detection, which still performs\nthe same two tasks in testing but has no training except using the given known\nclass names. This paper proposes a novel and yet simple method (called ZO-CLIP)\nto solve the problem. ZO-CLIP builds on top of the recent advances in zero-shot\nclassification through multi-modal representation learning. It first extends\nthe pre-trained multi-modal model CLIP by training a text-based image\ndescription generator on top of CLIP. In testing, it uses the extended model to\ngenerate some candidate unknown class names for each test sample and computes a\nconfidence score based on both the known class names and candidate unknown\nclass names for zero-shot open set detection. Experimental results on 5\nbenchmark datasets for open set detection confirm that ZO-CLIP outperforms the\nbaselines by a large margin.",

          "description": "Speech-based machine learning (ML) has been heralded as a promising solution\nfor tracking prosodic and spectrotemporal patterns in real-life that are\nindicative of emotional changes, providing a valuable window into one's\ncognitive and mental state. Yet, the scarcity of labelled data in ambulatory\nstudies prevents the reliable training of ML models, which usually rely on\n\"data-hungry\" distribution-based learning. Leveraging the abundance of labelled\nspeech data from acted emotions, this paper proposes a few-shot learning\napproach for automatically recognizing emotion in spontaneous speech from a\nsmall number of labelled samples. Few-shot learning is implemented via a metric\nlearning approach through a siamese neural network, which models the relative\ndistance between samples rather than relying on learning absolute patterns of\nthe corresponding distributions of each emotion. Results indicate the\nfeasibility of the proposed metric learning in recognizing emotions from\nspontaneous speech in four datasets, even with a small amount of labelled\nsamples. They further demonstrate superior performance of the proposed metric\nlearning compared to commonly used adaptation methods, including network\nfine-tuning and adversarial learning. Findings from this work provide a\nfoundation for the ambulatory tracking of human emotion in spontaneous speech\ncontributing to the real-life assessment of mental health degradation.",

          "description": "We study the few-shot learning (FSL) problem, where a model learns to\nrecognize new objects with extremely few labeled training data per category.\nMost of previous FSL approaches resort to the meta-learning paradigm, where the\nmodel accumulates inductive bias through learning many training tasks so as to\nsolve a new unseen few-shot task. In contrast, we propose a simple approach to\nexploit unlabeled data accompanying the few-shot task for improving few-shot\nperformance. Firstly, we propose a Dependency Maximization method based on the\nHilbert-Schmidt norm of the cross-covariance operator, which maximizes the\nstatistical dependency between the embedded feature of those unlabeled data and\ntheir label predictions, together with the supervised loss over the support\nset. We then use the obtained model to infer the pseudo-labels for those\nunlabeled data. Furthermore, we propose anInstance Discriminant Analysis to\nevaluate the credibility of each pseudo-labeled example and select the most\nfaithful ones into an augmented support set to retrain the model as in the\nfirst step. We iterate the above process until the pseudo-labels for the\nunlabeled data becomes stable.

          "description": "Maintaining the long-term exploration capability of the agent remains one of\nthe critical challenges in deep reinforcement learning. A representative\nsolution is to leverage reward shaping to provide intrinsic rewards for the\nagent to encourage exploration. However, most existing methods suffer from\nvanishing intrinsic rewards, which cannot provide sustainable exploration\nincentives. Moreover, they rely heavily on complex models and additional memory\nto record learning procedures, resulting in high computational complexity and\nlow robustness. To tackle this problem, entropy-based methods are proposed to\nevaluate the global exploration performance, encouraging the agent to visit the\nstate space more equitably. However, the sample complexity of estimating the\nstate visitation entropy is prohibitive when handling environments with\nhigh-dimensional observations. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric\nentitled Jain's fairness index (JFI) to replace the entropy regularizer, which\nsolves the exploration problem from a brand new perspective. In sharp contrast\nto the entropy regularizer, JFI is more computable and robust and can be easily\napplied generalized into arbitrary tasks. Furthermore, we leverage a\nvariational auto-encoder (VAE) model to capture the life-long novelty of\nstates, which is combined with the global JFI score to form multimodal\nintrinsic rewards. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that our\nmultimodal reward shaping (MMRS) method can achieve higher performance than\nother benchmark schemes.",

          "description": "We introduce Neural Marching Cubes (NMC), a data-driven approach for\nextracting a triangle mesh from a discretized implicit field. Classical MC is\ndefined by coarse tessellation templates isolated to individual cubes. While\nmore refined tessellations have been proposed, they all make heuristic\nassumptions, such as trilinearity, when determining the vertex positions and\nlocal mesh topologies in each cube. In principle, none of these approaches can\nreconstruct geometric features that reveal coherence or dependencies between\nnearby cubes (e.g., a sharp edge), as such information is unaccounted for,\nresulting in poor estimates of the true underlying implicit field. To tackle\nthese challenges, we re-cast MC from a deep learning perspective, by designing\ntessellation templates more apt at preserving geometric features, and learning\nthe vertex positions and mesh topologies from training meshes, to account for\ncontextual information from nearby cubes. We develop a compact per-cube\nparameterization to represent the output triangle mesh, while being compatible\nwith neural processing, so that a simple 3D convolutional network can be\nemployed for the training. We show that all topological cases in each cube that\nare applicable to our design can be easily derived using our representation,\nand the resulting tessellations can also be obtained naturally and efficiently\nby following a few design guidelines. In addition, our network learns local\nfeatures with limited receptive fields, hence it generalizes well to new shapes\nand new datasets. We evaluate our neural MC approach by quantitative and\nqualitative comparisons to all well-known MC variants. In particular, we\ndemonstrate the ability of our network to recover sharp features such as edges\nand corners, a long-standing issue of MC and its variants. Our network also\nreconstructs local mesh topologies more accurately than previous approaches.",

          "description": "Measuring the predictability and complexity of time series is an essential\ntool in designing and controlling the nonlinear system. Different entropy\nmeasures exist in the literature to analyze the predictability and complexity\nof time series. However, the existed methods have some drawbacks related to a\nstrong dependence of entropy on the parameters of the methods, as well as on\nthe length and amplitude of the time series. To overcome these difficulties,\nthis study proposes a new method for estimating the entropy of a time series\nusing the LogNNet neural network model. The LogNNet reservoir matrix is filled\nwith the time series elements according to our algorithm. The network is\ntrained on MNIST-10 dataset and the classification accuracy is calculated. The\naccuracy is considered as the entropy measure and denoted by NNetEn. The\nnovelty of entropy calculation is that the time series is involved in mixing\nthe input information in the reservoir. The greater complexity of the time\nseries leads to the better ability of the neural network to learn, and to the\nhigher classification accuracy and NNetEn values. The epochs number in the\ntraining process of LogNNet is considered as the control parameter. We\nintroduce a new time series characteristic, called time series learning\ninertia, that determines the learning rate of the neural network. The\nrobustness and efficiency of the method is verified on chaotic, periodic,\nrandom, binary and constant time series.

          "description": "This paper studies a class of constrained restless multi-armed bandits\n(CRMAB). The constraints are in the form of time varying set of actions (set of\navailable arms). This variation can be either stochastic or semi-deterministic.\nGiven a set of arms, a fixed number of them can be chosen to be played in each\ndecision interval. The play of each arm yields a state dependent reward. The\ncurrent states of arms are partially observable through binary feedback signals\nfrom arms that are played. The current availability of arms is fully\nobservable. The objective is to maximize long term cumulative reward. The\nuncertainty about future availability of arms along with partial state\ninformation makes this objective challenging. Applications for CRMAB can be\nfound in resource allocation in cyber-physical systems involving components\nwith time varying availability.\n\nFirst, this optimization problem is analyzed using Whittle's index policy. To\nthis end, a constrained restless single-armed bandit is studied. It is shown to\nadmit a threshold-type optimal policy and is also indexable. An algorithm to\ncompute Whittle's index is presented. An alternate solution method with lower\ncomplexity is also presented in the form of an online rollout policy. A\ndetailed discussion on the complexity of both these schemes is also presented,\nwhich suggests that online rollout policy with short look ahead is simpler to\nimplement than Whittle's index computation. Further, upper bounds on the value\nfunction are derived in order to estimate the degree of sub-optimality of\nvarious solutions.

          "description": "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change proposes different mitigation\nstrategies to achieve the net emissions reductions that would be required to\nfollow a pathway that limits global warming to 1.5{\\deg}C with no or limited\novershoot. The transition towards a carbon-free society goes through an\ninevitable increase in the share of renewable generation in the energy mix and\na drastic decrease in the total consumption of fossil fuels. Therefore, this\nthesis studies the integration of renewables in power systems by investigating\nforecasting and decision-making tools. Indeed, in contrast to conventional\npower plants, renewable energy is subject to uncertainty. Most of the\ngeneration technologies based on renewable sources are non-dispatchable, and\ntheir production is stochastic and complex to predict in advance. A high share\nof renewables is challenging for power systems that have been designed and\nsized for dispatchable units. In this context, probabilistic forecasts, which\naim at modeling the distribution of all possible future realizations, have\nbecome a vital tool to equip decision-makers, hopefully leading to better\ndecisions in energy applications. This thesis focuses on two main research\nquestions: (1) How to produce reliable probabilistic renewable generation\nforecasts, consumption, and electricity prices? (2) How to make decisions with\nuncertainty using probabilistic forecasts? The thesis perimeter is the energy\nmanagement of \"small\" systems such as microgrids at a residential scale on a\nday-ahead basis.

          "description": "Knowledge graphs represented as RDF datasets are integral to many machine\nlearning applications. RDF is supported by a rich ecosystem of data management\nsystems and tools, most notably RDF database systems that provide a SPARQL\nquery interface. Surprisingly, machine learning tools for knowledge graphs do\nnot use SPARQL, despite the obvious advantages of using a database system. This\nis due to the mismatch between SPARQL and machine learning tools in terms of\ndata model and programming style. Machine learning tools work on data in\ntabular format and process it using an imperative programming style, while\nSPARQL is declarative and has as its basic operation matching graph patterns to\nRDF triples. We posit that a good interface to knowledge graphs from a machine\nlearning software stack should use an imperative, navigational programming\nparadigm based on graph traversal rather than the SPARQL query paradigm based\non graph patterns. In this paper, we present RDFFrames, a framework that\nprovides such an interface. RDFFrames provides an imperative Python API that\ngets internally translated to SPARQL, and it is integrated with the PyData\nmachine learning software stack. RDFFrames enables the user to make a sequence\nof Python calls to define the data to be extracted from a knowledge graph\nstored in an RDF database system, and it translates these calls into a compact\nSPQARL query, executes it on the database system, and returns the results in a\nstandard tabular format. Thus, RDFFrames is a useful tool for data preparation\nthat combines the usability of PyData with the flexibility and performance of\nRDF database systems.",

          "description": "We study the problem of query attribute value extraction, which aims to\nidentify named entities from user queries as diverse surface form attribute\nvalues and afterward transform them into formally canonical forms.

To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a\nunified query attribute value extraction system in e-commerce search named\nQUEACO, which involves both two phases. Moreover, by leveraging large-scale\nweakly-labeled behavior data, we further improve the extraction performance\nwith less supervision cost. Specifically, for the NER phase, QUEACO adopts a\nnovel teacher-student network, where a teacher network that is trained on the\nstrongly-labeled data generates pseudo-labels to refine the weakly-labeled data\nfor training a student network. Meanwhile, the teacher network can be\ndynamically adapted by the feedback of the student's performance on\nstrongly-labeled data to maximally denoise the noisy supervisions from the weak\nlabels. For the AVN phase, we also leverage the weakly-labeled\nquery-to-attribute behavior data to normalize surface form attribute values\nfrom queries into canonical forms from products. Extensive experiments on a\nreal-world large-scale E-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of\nQUEACO.",

          "description": "A single unit (head) is the conventional input feature extractor in deep\nlearning architectures trained on multivariate time series signals. The\nimportance of the fixed-dimensional vector representation generated by the\nsingle-head network has been demonstrated for industrial machinery condition\nmonitoring and predictive maintenance. However, processing heterogeneous sensor\nsignals with a single head may result in a model that cannot explicitly account\nfor the diversity in time-varying multivariate inputs. This work extends the\nconventional single-head deep learning models to a more robust form by\ndeveloping context-specific heads to independently capture the inherent pattern\nof each sensor reading in multivariate time series signals. Using the turbofan\naircraft engine benchmark dataset (CMAPSS), an extensive experiment is\nperformed to verify the effectiveness and benefits of multi-head fully\nconnected neurons, recurrent networks, convolution network, the\ntransformer-style stand-alone attention network, and their variants for\nremaining useful life estimation. Moreover, the effect of different attention\nmechanisms on the multi-head models is also evaluated. In addition, each\narchitecture's relative advantage and computational overhead are analyzed.\nResults show that utilizing the attention layer is task-sensitive and\nmodel-dependent, as it does not provide consistent improvement across the\nmodels investigated. The result is further compared with five state-of-the-art\nmodels, and the comparison shows that a relatively simple multi-head\narchitecture performs better than the state-of-the-art models. The results\npresented in this study demonstrate the importance of multi-head models and\nattention mechanisms to improved understanding of the remaining useful life of\nindustrial assets.",

Although previous attempts to classify sleep stages have achieved\nhigh classification performance, several challenges remain open: 1) How to\neffectively utilize time-varying spatial and temporal features from\nmulti-channel brain signals remains challenging. Prior works have not been able\nto fully utilize the spatial topological information among brain regions. 2)\nDue to the many differences found in individual biological signals, how to\novercome the differences of subjects and improve the generalization of deep\nneural networks is important. 3) Most deep learning methods ignore the\ninterpretability of the model to the brain. To address the above challenges, we\npropose a multi-view spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks (MSTGCN)\nwith domain generalization for sleep stage classification. Specifically, we\nconstruct two brain view graphs for MSTGCN based on the functional connectivity\nand physical distance proximity of the brain regions. The MSTGCN consists of\ngraph convolutions for extracting spatial features and temporal convolutions\nfor capturing the transition rules among sleep stages. In addition, attention\nmechanism is employed for capturing the most relevant spatial-temporal\ninformation for sleep stage classification. Finally, domain generalization and\nMSTGCN are integrated into a unified framework to extract subject-invariant\nsleep features.

Also, these uncertainties bring extra challenges to task\noffloading under the oblivious adversary attack and data privacy risks. In this\narticle, we develop a new adversarial online learning algorithm with bandit\nfeedback based on the adversarial multi-armed bandit theory, to enable scalable\nand low-complexity offloading decision making. Specifically, we focus on\noptimizing fog node selection with the aim of minimizing the offloading service\ncosts in terms of delay and energy. The key is to implicitly tune the\nexploration bonus in the selection process and the assessment rules of the\ndesigned algorithm, taking into account volatile resource supply and demand. We\ntheoretically prove that the input-size dependent selection rule allows to\nchoose a suitable fog node without exploring the sub-optimal actions, and also\nan appropriate score patching rule allows to quickly adapt to evolving\ncircumstances, which reduce variance and bias simultaneously, thereby achieving\na better exploitation-exploration balance.

          "description": "Recent advances on Out-of-Distribution (OoD) generalization reveal the\nrobustness of deep learning models against distribution shifts. However,\nexisting works focus on OoD algorithms, such as invariant risk minimization,\ndomain generalization, or stable learning, without considering the influence of\ndeep model architectures on OoD generalization, which may lead to sub-optimal\nperformance. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods search for architecture\nbased on its performance on the training data, which may result in poor\ngeneralization for OoD tasks. In this work, we propose robust Neural\nArchitecture Search for OoD generalization (NAS-OoD), which optimizes the\narchitecture with respect to its performance on generated OoD data by gradient\ndescent. Specifically, a data generator is learned to synthesize OoD data by\nmaximizing losses computed by different neural architectures, while the goal\nfor architecture search is to find the optimal architecture parameters that\nminimize the synthetic OoD data losses. The data generator and the neural\narchitecture are jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner, and the minimax\ntraining process effectively discovers robust architectures that generalize\nwell for different distribution shifts. Extensive experimental results show\nthat NAS-OoD achieves superior performance on various OoD generalization\nbenchmarks with deep models having a much fewer number of parameters. In\naddition, on a real industry dataset, the proposed NAS-OoD method reduces the\nerror rate by more than 70% compared with the state-of-the-art method,\ndemonstrating the proposed method's practicality for real applications.",

Recent works intuitively apply contrastive\nlearning (CL) to learn representations, regarded as a pairwise manner, which is\nstill scalable: view-specific noise is not filtered in learning view-shared\nrepresentations; the fake negative pairs, where the negative terms are actually\nwithin the same class as the positive, and the real negative pairs are\ncoequally treated; and evenly measuring the similarities between terms might\ninterfere with optimization. Importantly, few works research the theoretical\nframework of generalized self-supervised multi-view learning, especially for\nmore than two views. To this end, we rethink the existing multi-view learning\nparadigm from the information theoretical perspective and then propose a novel\ninformation theoretical framework for generalized multi-view learning. Guided\nby it, we build a multi-view coding method with a three-tier progressive\narchitecture, namely Information theory-guided heuristic Progressive Multi-view\nCoding (IPMC). In the distribution-tier, IPMC aligns the distribution between\nviews to reduce view-specific noise. In the set-tier, IPMC builds self-adjusted\npools for contrasting, which utilizes a view filter to adaptively modify the\npools. Lastly, in the instance-tier, we adopt a designed unified loss to learn\ndiscriminative representations and reduce the gradient interference.\nTheoretically and empirically, we demonstrate the superiority of IPMC over\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

Despite this, our community has not fully succeeded in adapting\nmachine learning tools to answer counterfactual queries. This work addresses\nthis challenge by showing how to implement twin network counterfactual\ninference -- an alternative to abduction, action, & prediction counterfactual\ninference -- with deep learning to estimate counterfactual queries. We show how\nthe graphical nature of twin networks makes them particularly amenable to deep\nlearning, yielding simple neural network architectures that, when trained, are\ncapable of counterfactual inference. Importantly, we show how to enforce known\nidentifiability constraints during training, ensuring the answer to each\ncounterfactual query is uniquely determined.

          "description": "Motivation: Bacteriophages (aka phages), which mainly infect bacteria, play\nkey roles in the biology of microbes. As the most abundant biological entities\non the planet, the number of discovered phages is only the tip of the iceberg.\nRecently, many new phages have been revealed using high throughput sequencing,\nparticularly metagenomic sequencing. Compared to the fast accumulation of\nphage-like sequences, there is a serious lag in taxonomic classification of\nphages. High diversity, abundance, and limited known phages pose great\nchallenges for taxonomic analysis. In particular, alignment-based tools have\ndifficulty in classifying fast accumulating contigs assembled from metagenomic\ndata. Results: In this work, we present a novel semi-supervised learning model,\nnamed PhaGCN, to conduct taxonomic classification for phage contigs. In this\nlearning model, we construct a knowledge graph by combining the DNA sequence\nfeatures learned by convolutional neural network (CNN) and protein sequence\nsimilarity gained from gene-sharing network. Then we apply graph convolutional\nnetwork (GCN) to utilize both the labeled and unlabeled samples in training to\nenhance the learning ability. We tested PhaGCN on both simulated and real\nsequencing data. The results clearly show that our method competes favorably\nagainst available phage classification tools.",

For example, we show that learning an optimal network whose moralized\ngraph has vertex deletion distance at most $k$ from a graph with maximum degree\n1 can be computed in polynomial time when $k$ is constant.

To deal with the curse of\ndimensionality, recently considerable efforts in ensemble clustering have been\nmade by means of different subspace-based techniques. However, besides the\nemphasis on subspaces, rather limited attention has been paid to the potential\ndiversity in similarity/dissimilarity metrics. It remains a surprisingly open\nproblem in ensemble clustering how to create and aggregate a large population\nof diversified metrics, and furthermore, how to jointly investigate the\nmulti-level diversity in the large populations of metrics, subspaces, and\nclusters in a unified framework. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a\nnovel multidiversified ensemble clustering approach. In particular, we create a\nlarge number of diversified metrics by randomizing a scaled exponential\nsimilarity kernel, which are then coupled with random subspaces to form a large\nset of metric-subspace pairs. Based on the similarity matrices derived from\nthese metric-subspace pairs, an ensemble of diversified base clusterings can\nthereby be constructed. Further, an entropy-based criterion is utilized to\nexplore the cluster-wise diversity in ensembles, based on which three specific\nensemble clustering algorithms are presented by incorporating three types of\nconsensus functions. Extensive experiments are conducted on 30 high-dimensional\ndatasets, including 18 cancer gene expression datasets and 12 image/speech\ndatasets, which demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms over the\nstate-of-the-art.

It is widely known that traditional deep learning (DL)\nalgorithms usually show very good performance when trained with large datasets.\nHowever, in many applications, it is not possible to obtain such a high number\nof samples. In the image domain, typical FSL applications include those related\nto face recognition. In the audio domain, music fraud or speaker recognition\ncan be clearly benefited from FSL methods. This paper deals with the\napplication of FSL to the detection of specific and intentional acoustic events\ngiven by different types of sound alarms, such as door bells or fire alarms,\nusing a limited number of samples. These sounds typically occur in domestic\nenvironments where many events corresponding to a wide variety of sound classes\ntake place. Therefore, the detection of such alarms in a practical scenario can\nbe considered an open-set recognition (OSR) problem. To address the lack of a\ndedicated public dataset for audio FSL, researchers usually make modifications\non other available datasets. This paper is aimed at poviding the audio\nrecognition community with a carefully annotated dataset\n(https://zenodo.org/record/3689288) for FSL in an OSR context comprised of 1360\nclips from 34 classes divided into pattern sounds} and unwanted sounds.

          "description": "Weighting methods are a common tool to de-bias estimates of causal effects.\nAnd though there are an increasing number of seemingly disparate methods, many\nof them can be folded into one unifying regime: causal optimal transport. This\nnew method directly targets distributional balance by minimizing optimal\ntransport distances between treatment and control groups or, more generally,\nbetween a source and target population. Our approach is model-free but can also\nincorporate moments or any other important functions of covariates that the\nresearcher desires to balance. We find that the causal optimal transport\noutperforms competitor methods when both the propensity score and outcome\nmodels are misspecified, indicating it is a robust alternative to common\nweighting methods. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our method in an\nexternal control study examining the effect of misoprostol versus oxytocin for\ntreatment of post-partum hemorrhage.",

Many of the existing approaches in\nthe literature show good performance while requiring a lot of training\nresources. In this paper, the online matrix profile, which requires no\ntraining, is proposed to address this issue. The anomalies are detected by\nreferring to the past subsequence that is the closest to the current one. The\ndistance significance is introduced based on the online matrix profile, which\ndemonstrates a prominent pattern when an anomaly occurs. Another training-free\napproach spectral residual is integrated into our approach to further enhance\nthe detection accuracy. Moreover, the proposed approach is sped up by at least\nfour times for long time series by the introduced cache strategy. In comparison\nto the existing approaches, the online matrix profile makes a good trade-off\nbetween accuracy and efficiency.

          "description": "Recommender systems research tends to evaluate model performance offline and\non randomly sampled targets, yet the same systems are later used to predict\nuser behavior sequentially from a fixed point in time. Simulating online\nrecommender system performance is notoriously difficult and the discrepancy\nbetween online and offline behaviors is typically not accounted for in offline\nevaluations. This disparity permits weaknesses to go unnoticed until the model\nis deployed in a production setting. In this paper, we first demonstrate how\nomitting temporal context when evaluating recommender system performance leads\nto false confidence. To overcome this, we postulate that offline evaluation\nprotocols can only model real-life use-cases if they account for temporal\ncontext. Next, we propose a training procedure to further embed the temporal\ncontext in existing models. We use a multi-objective approach to introduce\ntemporal context into traditionally time-unaware recommender systems and\nconfirm its advantage via the proposed evaluation protocol. Finally, we\nvalidate that the Pareto Fronts obtained with the added objective dominate\nthose produced by state-of-the-art models that are only optimized for accuracy\non three real-world publicly available datasets. The results show that\nincluding our temporal objective can improve recall@20 by up to 20%.",

          "description": "Online mirror descent (OMD) and dual averaging (DA) -- two fundamental\nalgorithms for online convex optimization -- are known to have very similar\n(and sometimes identical) performance guarantees when used with a fixed\nlearning rate. Under dynamic learning rates, however, OMD is provably inferior\nto DA and suffers a linear regret, even in common settings such as prediction\nwith expert advice. We modify the OMD algorithm through a simple technique that\nwe call stabilization. We give essentially the same abstract regret bound for\nOMD with stabilization and for DA by modifying the classical OMD convergence\nanalysis in a careful and modular way that allows for straightforward and\nflexible proofs. Simple corollaries of these bounds show that OMD with\nstabilization and DA enjoy the same performance guarantees in many applications\n-- even under dynamic learning rates. We also shed light on the similarities\nbetween OMD and DA and show simple conditions under which stabilized-OMD and DA\ngenerate the same iterates.",

To validate our models and findings, we divide the land of\nCalifornia into 4,242 grids of 0.1 degrees $\\times$ 0.1 degrees in latitude and\nlongitude, and compute the risk of each grid based on spatial and temporal\nconditions. To verify the generalizability of our models, we further expand the\nscope of wildfire risk assessment from California to Washington without any\nfine tuning.

          "description": "In practice, and more especially when training deep neural networks, visual\nrecognition rules are often learned based on various sources of information. On\nthe other hand, the recent deployment of facial recognition systems with uneven\npredictive performances on different population segments highlights the\nrepresentativeness issues possibly induced by a naive aggregation of image\ndatasets. Indeed, sampling bias does not vanish simply by considering larger\ndatasets, and ignoring its impact may completely jeopardize the generalization\ncapacity of the learned prediction rules. In this paper, we show how biasing\nmodels, originally introduced for nonparametric estimation in (Gill et al.,\n1988), and recently revisited from the perspective of statistical learning\ntheory in (Laforgue and Cl\\'emen\\c{c}on, 2019), can be applied to remedy these\nproblems in the context of visual recognition. Based on the (approximate)\nknowledge of the biasing mechanisms at work, our approach consists in\nreweighting the observations, so as to form a nearly debiased estimator of the\ntarget distribution. One key condition for our method to be theoretically valid\nis that the supports of the distributions generating the biased datasets at\ndisposal must overlap, and cover the support of the target distribution. In\norder to meet this requirement in practice, we propose to use a low dimensional\nimage representation, shared across the image databases. Finally, we provide\nnumerical experiments highlighting the relevance of our approach whenever the\nbiasing functions are appropriately chosen.",

          "description": "Classification has been a major task for building intelligent systems as it\nenables decision-making under uncertainty. Classifier design aims at building\nmodels from training data for representing feature-label distributions--either\nexplicitly or implicitly. In many scientific or clinical settings, training\ndata are typically limited, which makes designing accurate classifiers and\nevaluating their classification error extremely challenging. While transfer\nlearning (TL) can alleviate this issue by incorporating data from relevant\nsource domains to improve learning in a different target domain, it has\nreceived little attention for performance assessment, notably in error\nestimation. In this paper, we fill this gap by investigating knowledge\ntransferability in the context of classification error estimation within a\nBayesian paradigm. We introduce a novel class of Bayesian minimum mean-square\nerror (MMSE) estimators for optimal Bayesian transfer learning (OBTL), which\nenables rigorous evaluation of classification error under uncertainty in a\nsmall-sample setting. Using Monte Carlo importance sampling, we employ the\nproposed estimator to evaluate the classification accuracy of a broad family of\nclassifiers that span diverse learning capabilities. Experimental results based\non both synthetic data as well as real-world RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data show\nthat our proposed OBTL error estimation scheme clearly outperforms standard\nerror estimators, especially in a small-sample setting, by tapping into the\ndata from other relevant domains.",

In this setting, many methods directly attack surrogate models and\ntransfer the obtained adversarial examples to fool the target model. Plenty of\nprevious works investigated what kind of attacks to the surrogate model can\ngenerate more transferable adversarial examples, but their performances are\nstill limited due to the mismatches between surrogate models and the target\nmodel. In this paper, we tackle this problem from a novel angle -- instead of\nusing the original surrogate models, can we obtain a Meta-Surrogate Model (MSM)\nsuch that attacks to this model can be easier transferred to other models? We\nshow that this goal can be mathematically formulated as a well-posed\n(bi-level-like) optimization problem and design a differentiable attacker to\nmake training feasible. Given one or a set of surrogate models, our method can\nthus obtain an MSM such that adversarial examples generated on MSM enjoy\neximious transferability. Comprehensive experiments on Cifar-10 and ImageNet\ndemonstrate that by attacking the MSM, we can obtain stronger transferable\nadversarial examples to fool black-box models including adversarially trained\nones, with much higher success rates than existing methods.

This causes security risks on its\nprediction outcome. For example, attackers attempt to poison the model by\neither presenting inaccurate misrepresentative data or altering the models'\nparameters. In addition, Byzantine faults including software, hardware, network\nissues occur in distributed systems which also lead to a negative impact on the\nprediction outcome. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed training\nalgorithm, partial synchronous stochastic gradient descent (ParSGD), which\ndefends adversarial attacks and/or tolerates Byzantine faults. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our algorithm under three common adversarial attacks again\nthe ML models and a Byzantine fault during the training phase. Our results show\nthat using ParSGD, ML models can still produce accurate predictions as if it is\nnot being attacked nor having failures at all when almost half of the nodes are\nbeing compromised or failed. We will report the experimental evaluations of\nParSGD in comparison with other algorithms.",

          "description": "The COVID-19 pandemic raises the problem of adapting face recognition systems\nto the new reality, where people may wear surgical masks to cover their noses\nand mouths. Traditional data sets (e.g., CelebA, CASIA-WebFace) used for\ntraining these systems were released before the pandemic, so they now seem\nunsuited due to the lack of examples of people wearing masks. We propose a\nmethod for enhancing data sets containing faces without masks by creating\nsynthetic masks and overlaying them on faces in the original images. Our method\nrelies on Spark AR Studio, a developer program made by Facebook that is used to\ncreate Instagram face filters. In our approach, we use 9 masks of different\ncolors, shapes and fabrics. We employ our method to generate a number of\n445,446 (90%) samples of masks for the CASIA-WebFace data set and 196,254\n(96.8%) masks for the CelebA data set, releasing the mask images at\nhttps://github.com/securifai/masked_faces. We show that our method produces\nsignificantly more realistic training examples of masks overlaid on faces by\nasking volunteers to qualitatively compare it to other methods or data sets\ndesigned for the same task. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our method by\nevaluating state-of-the-art face recognition systems (FaceNet, VGG-face,\nArcFace) trained on the enhanced data sets and showing that they outperform\nequivalent systems trained on the original data sets (containing faces without\nmasks), when the test benchmark contains masked faces.",

          "description": "Knowledge transfer across several streaming processes remain challenging\nproblem not only because of different distributions of each stream but also\nbecause of rapidly changing and never-ending environments of data streams.\nAlbeit growing research achievements in this area, most of existing works are\ndeveloped for a single source domain which limits its resilience to exploit\nmulti-source domains being beneficial to recover from concept drifts quickly\nand to avoid the negative transfer problem. An online domain adaptation\ntechnique under multisource streaming processes, namely automatic online\nmulti-source domain adaptation (AOMSDA), is proposed in this paper. The online\ndomain adaptation strategy of AOMSDA is formulated under a coupled generative\nand discriminative approach of denoising autoencoder (DAE) where the central\nmoment discrepancy (CMD)-based regularizer is integrated to handle the\nexistence of multi-source domains thereby taking advantage of complementary\ninformation sources. The asynchronous concept drifts taking place at different\ntime periods are addressed by a self-organizing structure and a node\nre-weighting strategy. Our numerical study demonstrates that AOMSDA is capable\nof outperforming its counterparts in 5 of 8 study cases while the ablation\nstudy depicts the advantage of each learning component. In addition, AOMSDA is\ngeneral for any number of source streams. The source code of AOMSDA is shared\npublicly in https://github.com/Renchunzi-Xie/AOMSDA.git.",

As the virus continues to spread on a global scale, the\nmajority of efforts have been on the development of vaccines and the mass\nimmunization of the public. While the daily case numbers were following a\ndecreasing trend, the emergent of new virus mutations and variants still pose a\nsignificant threat. As economies start recovering and societies start opening\nup with people going back into office buildings, schools, and malls, we still\nneed to have the ability to detect and minimize the spread of COVID-19.\nIndividuals with COVID-19 may show multiple symptoms such as cough, fever, and\nshortness of breath. Many of the existing detection techniques focus on\nsymptoms having the same equal importance. However, it has been shown that some\nsymptoms are more prevalent than others. In this paper, we present a multimodal\nmethod to predict COVID-19 by incorporating existing deep learning classifiers\nusing convolutional neural networks and our novel probability-based weighting\nfunction that considers the prevalence of each symptom. The experiments were\nperformed on an existing dataset with respect to the three considered modes of\ncoughs, fever, and shortness of breath. The results show considerable\nimprovements in the detection of COVID-19 using our weighting function when\ncompared to an equal weighting function.",

          "description": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are one of the most widely used\ngenerative models. GANs can learn complex multi-modal distributions, and\ngenerate real-like samples. Despite the major success of GANs in generating\nsynthetic data, they might suffer from unstable training process, and mode\ncollapse. In this paper, we introduce a new GAN architecture called variance\nenforcing GAN (VARGAN), which incorporates a third network to introduce\ndiversity in the generated samples. The third network measures the diversity of\nthe generated samples, which is used to penalize the generator's loss for low\ndiversity samples. The network is trained on the available training data and\nundesired distributions with limited modality. On a set of synthetic and\nreal-world image data, VARGAN generates a more diverse set of samples compared\nto the recent state-of-the-art models.

However, this measure of performance conceals\nsignificant differences in how different classes and images are impacted by\nmodel compression techniques. We find that models with radically different\nnumbers of weights have comparable top-line performance metrics but diverge\nconsiderably in behavior on a narrow subset of the dataset. This small subset\nof data points, which we term Pruning Identified Exemplars (PIEs) are\nsystematically more impacted by the introduction of sparsity. Compression\ndisproportionately impacts model performance on the underrepresented long-tail\nof the data distribution. PIEs over-index on atypical or noisy images that are\nfar more challenging for both humans and algorithms to classify.

However, in several domains, such as\nmedicine, the scarcity of labeled training data is a common issue. Also, these\nmodels may not work well in cases where class imbalance is prevalent. Active\nlearning may prove helpful in these cases to boost the performance with a\nlimited label budget. To this end, we propose a novel method using sampling\ntechniques based on submodular optimization and optimal transport for active\nlearning in language models, dubbed ALLWAS. We construct a sampling strategy\nbased on submodular optimization of the designed objective in the gradient\ndomain. Furthermore, to enable learning from few samples, we propose a novel\nstrategy for sampling from the Wasserstein barycenters.

          "description": "Tensor factorization has been proved as an efficient unsupervised learning\napproach for health data analysis, especially for computational phenotyping,\nwhere the high-dimensional Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with patients\nhistory of medical procedures, medications, diagnosis, lab tests, etc., are\nconverted to meaningful and interpretable medical concepts. Federated tensor\nfactorization distributes the tensor computation to multiple workers under the\ncoordination of a central server, which enables jointly learning the phenotypes\nacross multiple hospitals while preserving the privacy of the patient\ninformation. However, existing federated tensor factorization algorithms\nencounter the single-point-failure issue with the involvement of the central\nserver, which is not only easily exposed to external attacks, but also limits\nthe number of clients sharing information with the server under restricted\nuplink bandwidth. In this paper, we propose CiderTF, a communication-efficient\ndecentralized generalized tensor factorization, which reduces the uplink\ncommunication cost by leveraging a four-level communication reduction strategy\ndesigned for a generalized tensor factorization, which has the flexibility of\nmodeling different tensor distribution with multiple kinds of loss functions.\nExperiments on two real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that CiderTF achieves\ncomparable convergence with the communication reduction up to 99.99%.",

          "description": "The robustness of the much-used Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to\nperturbations of their input is becoming a topic of increasing importance. In\nthis paper, the random GCN is introduced for which a random matrix theory\nanalysis is possible. This analysis suggests that if the graph is sufficiently\nperturbed, or in the extreme case random, then the GCN fails to benefit from\nthe node features. It is furthermore observed that enhancing the message\npassing step in GCNs by adding the node feature kernel to the adjacency matrix\nof the graph structure solves this problem. An empirical study of a GCN\nutilised for node classification on six real datasets further confirms the\ntheoretical findings and demonstrates that perturbations of the graph structure\ncan result in GCNs performing significantly worse than Multi-Layer Perceptrons\nrun on the node features alone. In practice, adding a node feature kernel to\nthe message passing of perturbed graphs results in a significant improvement of\nthe GCN's performance, thereby rendering it more robust to graph perturbations.\nOur code is publicly available at:https://github.com/ChangminWu/RobustGCN.",

Its linear unit performs a multiplication of an input\nvector and a weight matrix in optical analog circuits. Among them, a circuit\nwith a multiple-layered structure of programmable Mach-Zehnder interferometers\n(MZIs) can realize a specific class of unitary matrices with a limited number\nof MZIs as its weight matrix. The circuit is effective for balancing the number\nof programmable MZIs and ONN performance. However, it takes a lot of time to\nlearn MZI parameters of the circuit with a conventional automatic\ndifferentiation (AD), which machine learning platforms are equipped with. To\nsolve the time-consuming problem, we propose an acceleration method for\nlearning MZI parameters. We create customized complex-valued derivatives for an\nMZI, exploiting Wirtinger derivatives and a chain rule. They are incorporated\ninto our newly developed function module implemented in C++ to collectively\ncalculate their values in a multi-layered structure. Our method is simple,\nfast, and versatile as well as compatible with the conventional AD.

The training data set for CNNs\ndedicated to permeability prediction consists of permeability labels that are\ntypically generated by classical lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) that simulate\nthe flow through the pore space of the segmented image data. We instead perform\ndirect numerical simulation (DNS) by solving the stationary Stokes equation in\nan efficient and distributed-parallel manner.

More precisely, by exploiting the connection to\nflow problems on a graph representation of the pore space, additional\ninformation about confined structures is provided to the network in terms of\nthe maximum flow value, which is the key innovative component of our workflow.\nAs a result, unprecedented prediction accuracy and robustness are observed for\na variety of sandstone samples from archetypal rock formations.",

          "description": "As a novel similarity measure that is defined as the expectation of a kernel\nfunction between two random variables, correntropy has been successfully\napplied in robust machine learning and signal processing to combat large\noutliers. The kernel function in correntropy is usually a zero-mean Gaussian\nkernel. In a recent work, the concept of mixture correntropy (MC) was proposed\nto improve the learning performance, where the kernel function is a mixture\nGaussian kernel, namely a linear combination of several zero-mean Gaussian\nkernels with different widths. In both correntropy and mixture correntropy, the\ncenter of the kernel function is, however, always located at zero. In the\npresent work, to further improve the learning performance, we propose the\nconcept of multi-kernel correntropy (MKC), in which each component of the\nmixture Gaussian kernel can be centered at a different location. The properties\nof the MKC are investigated and an efficient approach is proposed to determine\nthe free parameters in MKC. Experimental results show that the learning\nalgorithms under the maximum multi-kernel correntropy criterion (MMKCC) can\noutperform those under the original maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) and the\nmaximum mixture correntropy criterion (MMCC).",

In this\nwork, we present a new architecture, parallel CapsNets, which exploits the\nconcept of branching the network to isolate certain capsules, allowing each\nbranch to identify different entities. We applied our concept to the two\ncurrent types of CapsNet architectures, studying the performance for networks\nwith different layers of capsules. We tested our design in a public, highly\nunbalanced dataset of acute myeloid leukaemia images (15 classes). Our\nexperiments showed that conventional CapsNets show similar performance than our\nbaseline CNN (ResNeXt-50) but depict instability problems. In contrast,\nparallel CapsNets can outperform ResNeXt-50, is more stable, and shows better\nrotational invariance than both, conventional CapsNets and ResNeXt-50.",

We adopt generative pre-trained language models\nto encode task-specific instructions along with input and generate task output.\nOur results indicate that models can benefit from instructions to generalize\nacross tasks.

          "description": "Vision-and-language (V\\&L) reasoning necessitates perception of visual\nconcepts such as objects and actions, understanding semantics and language\ngrounding, and reasoning about the interplay between the two modalities. One\ncrucial aspect of visual reasoning is spatial understanding, which involves\nunderstanding relative locations of objects, i.e.\\ implicitly learning the\ngeometry of the scene. In this work, we evaluate the faithfulness of V\\&L\nmodels to such geometric understanding, by formulating the prediction of\npair-wise relative locations of objects as a classification as well as a\nregression task. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art transformer-based\nV\\&L models lack sufficient abilities to excel at this task.

          "description": "In deep neural networks, better results can often be obtained by increasing\nthe complexity of previously developed basic models. However, it is unclear\nwhether there is a way to boost performance by decreasing the complexity of\nsuch models. Here, based on an optimization method, we investigate the\nfeasibility of improving graph classification performance while simplifying the\nmodel learning process. Inspired by progress in structural information\nassessment, we optimize the given data sample from graphs to encoding trees. In\nparticular, we minimize the structural entropy of the transformed encoding tree\nto decode the key structure underlying a graph. This transformation is denoted\nas structural optimization. Furthermore, we propose a novel feature combination\nscheme, termed hierarchical reporting, for encoding trees. In this scheme,\nfeatures are transferred from leaf nodes to root nodes by following the\nhierarchical structures of encoding trees. We then present an implementation of\nthe scheme in a tree kernel and a convolutional network to perform graph\nclassification. The tree kernel follows label propagation in the\nWeisfeiler-Lehman (WL) subtree kernel, but it has a lower runtime complexity\n$O(n)$. The convolutional network is a special implementation of our tree\nkernel in the deep learning field and is called Encoding Tree Learning (ETL).\nWe empirically validate our tree kernel and convolutional network with several\ngraph classification benchmarks and demonstrate that our methods achieve better\nperformance and lower computational consumption than competing approaches.",

          "description": "Using only a model that was trained to predict where people look at images,\nand no additional training data, we can produce a range of powerful editing\neffects for reducing distraction in images. Given an image and a mask\nspecifying the region to edit, we backpropagate through a state-of-the-art\nsaliency model to parameterize a differentiable editing operator, such that the\nsaliency within the masked region is reduced. We demonstrate several operators,\nincluding: a recoloring operator, which learns to apply a color transform that\ncamouflages and blends distractors into their surroundings; a warping operator,\nwhich warps less salient image regions to cover distractors, gradually\ncollapsing objects into themselves and effectively removing them (an effect\nakin to inpainting); a GAN operator, which uses a semantic prior to fully\nreplace image regions with plausible, less salient alternatives. The resulting\neffects are consistent with cognitive research on the human visual system\n(e.g., since color mismatch is salient, the recoloring operator learns to\nharmonize objects' colors with their surrounding to reduce their saliency),\nand, importantly, are all achieved solely through the guidance of the\npretrained saliency model, with no additional supervision.

This student performance\n(SP) modeling problem, also known as knowledge tracing, is a critical step for\nbuilding adaptive online teaching systems. Specifically, we conduct a study of\nhow to utilize various types and large amounts of students log data to train\naccurate machine learning models that predict the knowledge state of future\nstudents. This study is the first to use four very large datasets made\navailable recently from four distinct intelligent tutoring systems. Our results\ninclude a new machine learning approach that defines a new state of the art for\nSP modeling, improving over earlier methods in several ways: First, we achieve\nimproved accuracy by introducing new features that can be easily computed from\nconventional question-response logs (e.g., the pattern in the student's most\nrecent answers). Second, we take advantage of features of the student history\nthat go beyond question-response pairs (e.g., which video segments the student\nwatched, or skipped) as well as information about prerequisite structure in the\ncurriculum. Third, we train multiple specialized modeling models for different\naspects of the curriculum (e.g., specializing in early versus later segments of\nthe student history), then combine these specialized models to create a group\nprediction of student knowledge. Taken together, these innovations yield an\naverage AUC score across these four datasets of 0.807 compared to the previous\nbest logistic regression approach score of 0.766, and also outperforming\nstate-of-the-art deep neural net approaches. Importantly, we observe consistent\nimprovements from each of our three methodological innovations, in each\ndataset, suggesting that our methods are of general utility and likely to\nproduce improvements for other online tutoring systems as well.",

Adding\nauxiliary losses to the main objective function is a general way of encoding\nbiases that can help networks learn better representations. However, since\nauxiliary losses are minimized only on training data, they suffer from the same\ngeneralization gap as regular task losses. Moreover, by adding a term to the\nloss function, the model optimizes a different objective than the one we care\nabout. In this work we address both problems: first, we take inspiration from\n\\textit{transductive learning} and note that after receiving an input but\nbefore making a prediction, we can fine-tune our networks on any unsupervised\nloss. We call this process {\\em tailoring}, because we customize the model to\neach input to ensure our prediction satisfies the inductive bias. Second, we\nformulate {\\em meta-tailoring}, a nested optimization similar to that in\nmeta-learning, and train our models to perform well on the task objective after\nadapting them using an unsupervised loss. The advantages of tailoring and\nmeta-tailoring are discussed theoretically and demonstrated empirically on a\ndiverse set of examples.",

          "description": "Cough is a major symptom of respiratory-related diseases. There exists a\ntremendous amount of work in detecting coughs from audio but there has been no\neffort to identify coughs from solely inertial measurement unit (IMU). Coughing\ncauses motion across the whole body and especially on the neck and head.\nTherefore, head motion data during coughing captured by a head-worn IMU sensor\ncould be leveraged to detect coughs using a template matching algorithm. In\ntime series template matching problems, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) combined with\nelastic distance measurement (esp. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)) achieves\noutstanding performance. However, it is often regarded as prohibitively\ntime-consuming. Nearest Centroid Classifier is thereafter proposed. But the\naccuracy is comprised of only one centroid obtained for each class.\nCentroid-based Classifier performs clustering and averaging for each cluster,\nbut requires manually setting the number of clusters. We propose a novel\nself-tuning multi-centroid template-matching algorithm, which can automatically\nadjust the number of clusters to balance accuracy and inference time. Through\nexperiments conducted on synthetic datasets and a real-world earbud-based cough\ndataset, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm and present\nthe result of cough detection with a single accelerometer sensor on the earbuds\nplatform.",

          "description": "Network quantization, which aims to reduce the bit-lengths of the network\nweights and activations, has emerged for their deployments to resource-limited\ndevices. Although recent studies have successfully discretized a full-precision\nnetwork, they still incur large quantization errors after training, thus giving\nrise to a significant performance gap between a full-precision network and its\nquantized counterpart. In this work, we propose a novel quantization method for\nneural networks, Cluster-Promoting Quantization (CPQ) that finds the optimal\nquantization grids while naturally encouraging the underlying full-precision\nweights to gather around those quantization grids cohesively during training.\nThis property of CPQ is thanks to our two main ingredients that enable\ndifferentiable quantization: i) the use of the categorical distribution\ndesigned by a specific probabilistic parametrization in the forward pass and\nii) our proposed multi-class straight-through estimator (STE) in the backward\npass. Since our second component, multi-class STE, is intrinsically biased, we\nadditionally propose a new bit-drop technique, DropBits, that revises the\nstandard dropout regularization to randomly drop bits instead of neurons. As a\nnatural extension of DropBits, we further introduce the way of learning\nheterogeneous quantization levels to find proper bit-length for each layer by\nimposing an additional regularization on DropBits. We experimentally validate\nour method on various benchmark datasets and network architectures, and also\nsupport a new hypothesis for quantization: learning heterogeneous quantization\nlevels outperforms the case using the same but fixed quantization levels from\nscratch.",

          "description": "Sampling methods (e.g., node-wise, layer-wise, or subgraph) has become an\nindispensable strategy to speed up training large-scale Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs). However, existing sampling methods are mostly based on the graph\nstructural information and ignore the dynamicity of optimization, which leads\nto high variance in estimating the stochastic gradients. The high variance\nissue can be very pronounced in extremely large graphs, where it results in\nslow convergence and poor generalization. In this paper, we theoretically\nanalyze the variance of sampling methods and show that, due to the composite\nstructure of empirical risk, the variance of any sampling method can be\ndecomposed into \\textit{embedding approximation variance} in the forward stage\nand \\textit{stochastic gradient variance} in the backward stage that\nnecessities mitigating both types of variance to obtain faster convergence\nrate. We propose a decoupled variance reduction strategy that employs\n(approximate) gradient information to adaptively sample nodes with minimal\nvariance, and explicitly reduces the variance introduced by embedding\napproximation. We show theoretically and empirically that the proposed method,\neven with smaller mini-batch sizes, enjoys a faster convergence rate and\nentails a better generalization compared to the existing methods.",

The patterns that deep networks have learned\nfrom a training dataset can be grasped by observing the feature variation among\nvarious classes. However, current approaches perform the feature modification\nto increase the classification probability for the target class irrespective of\nthe internal characteristics of deep networks. This often leads to unclear\nexplanations that deviate from real-world data distributions. To address this\nproblem, we propose a counterfactual explanation method that exploits the\nstatistics learned from a training dataset.

The masking\nstep aims to select an important feature from the input data to be classified\nas a target class. Meanwhile, the composition step aims to optimize the\npreviously selected feature by ensuring that its output score is close to the\nlogit space of the training data that are classified as the target class.\nExperimental results show that our method produces human-friendly\ninterpretations on various classification datasets and verify that such\ninterpretations can be achieved with fewer feature modification.",

          "description": "SARS-CoV-2, like any other virus, continues to mutate as it spreads,\naccording to an evolutionary process. Unlike any other virus, the number of\ncurrently available sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in public databases such as GISAID\nis already several million. This amount of data has the potential to uncover\nthe evolutionary dynamics of a virus like never before. However, a million is\nalready several orders of magnitude beyond what can be processed by the\ntraditional methods designed to reconstruct a virus's evolutionary history,\nsuch as those that build a phylogenetic tree. Hence, new and scalable methods\nwill need to be devised in order to make use of the ever increasing number of\nviral sequences being collected.\n\nSince identifying variants is an important part of understanding the\nevolution of a virus, in this paper, we propose an approach based on clustering\nsequences to identify the current major SARS-CoV-2 variants. Using a $k$-mer\nbased feature vector generation and efficient feature selection methods, our\napproach is effective in identifying variants, as well as being efficient and\nscalable to millions of sequences. Such a clustering method allows us to show\nthe relative proportion of each variant over time, giving the rate of spread of\neach variant in different locations -- something which is important for vaccine\ndevelopment and distribution. We also compute the importance of each amino acid\nposition of the spike protein in identifying a given variant in terms of\ninformation gain. Positions of high variant-specific importance tend to agree\nwith those reported by the USA's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC), further demonstrating our approach.",

          "description": "This paper is concerned with a state-space approach to deep Gaussian process\n(DGP) regression. We construct the DGP by hierarchically putting transformed\nGaussian process (GP) priors on the length scales and magnitudes of the next\nlevel of Gaussian processes in the hierarchy. The idea of the state-space\napproach is to represent the DGP as a non-linear hierarchical system of linear\nstochastic differential equations (SDEs), where each SDE corresponds to a\nconditional GP. The DGP regression problem then becomes a state estimation\nproblem, and we can estimate the state efficiently with sequential methods by\nusing the Markov property of the state-space DGP. The computational complexity\nscales linearly with respect to the number of measurements. Based on this, we\nformulate state-space MAP as well as Bayesian filtering and smoothing solutions\nto the DGP regression problem. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed\nmodels and methods on synthetic non-stationary signals and apply the\nstate-space DGP to detection of the gravitational waves from LIGO measurements.",

While prior studies have focused on boosting the model\naccuracy, quantifying the reproducibility of the most discriminative features\nidentified by GNNs is still an intact problem that yields concerns about their\nreliability in clinical applications in particular. Specifically, the\nreproducibility of biological markers across clinical datasets and distribution\nshifts across classes (e.g., healthy and disordered brains) is of paramount\nimportance in revealing the underpinning mechanisms of diseases as well as\npropelling the development of personalized treatment. Motivated by these\nissues, we propose, for the first time, reproducibility-based GNN selection\n(RG-Select), a framework for GNN reproducibility assessment via the\nquantification of the most discriminative features (i.e., biomarkers) shared\nbetween different models. To ascertain the soundness of our framework, the\nreproducibility assessment embraces variations of different factors such as\ntraining strategies and data perturbations. Despite these challenges, our\nframework successfully yielded replicable conclusions across different training\nstrategies and various clinical datasets. Our findings could thus pave the way\nfor the development of biomarker trustworthiness and reliability assessment\nmethods for computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis tasks.

A common\napproach is to represent data objects as binary vectors, denoted \\textit{hash\ncodes}, which require little storage and enable efficient similarity search\nthrough direct indexing into a hash table or through similarity computations in\nan appropriate space. Due to the limited expressibility of hash codes, compared\nto real-valued representations, a core open challenge is how to generate hash\ncodes that well capture semantic content or latent properties using a small\nnumber of bits, while ensuring that the hash codes are distributed in a way\nthat does not reduce their search efficiency. State of the art methods use\nrepresentation learning for generating such hash codes, focusing on neural\nautoencoder architectures where semantics are encoded into the hash codes by\nlearning to reconstruct the original inputs of the hash codes. This thesis\naddresses the above challenge and makes a number of contributions to\nrepresentation learning that (i) improve effectiveness of hash codes through\nmore expressive representations and a more effective similarity measure than\nthe current state of the art, namely the Hamming distance, and (ii) improve\nefficiency of hash codes by learning representations that are especially suited\nto the choice of search method.

In the cross-modal setting, tokens in the sentence are masked at\nrandom, and the model predicts the masked tokens given the image and the text.\nIn this paper, we observe several key disadvantages of MLM in this setting.\nFirst, as captions tend to be short, in a third of the sentences no token is\nsampled. Second, the majority of masked tokens are stop-words and punctuation,\nleading to under-utilization of the image. We investigate a range of\nalternative masking strategies specific to the cross-modal setting that address\nthese shortcomings, aiming for better fusion of text and image in the learned\nrepresentation. When pre-training the LXMERT model, our alternative masking\nstrategies consistently improve over the original masking strategy on three\ndownstream tasks, especially in low resource settings. Further, our\npre-training approach substantially outperforms the baseline model on a\nprompt-based probing task designed to elicit image objects.

          "description": "Plant water stress may occur due to the limited availability of water to the\nroots/soil or due to increased transpiration. These factors adversely affect\nplant physiology and photosynthetic ability to the extent that it has been\nshown to have inhibitory effects in both growth and yield [18]. Early\nidentification of plant water stress status enables suitable corrective\nmeasures to be applied to obtain the expected crop yield. Further, improving\ncrop yield through precision agriculture methods is a key component of climate\npolicy and the UN sustainable development goals [1]. Leaf water content (LWC)\nis a measure that can be used to estimate water content and identify stressed\nplants. LWC during the early crop growth stages is an important indicator of\nplant productivity and yield. The effect of water stress can be instantaneous\n[15], affecting gaseous exchange or long-term, significantly reducing [9, 18,\n22]. It is thus necessary to identify potential plant water stress during the\nearly stages of growth [15] to introduce corrective irrigation and alleviate\nstress. LWC is also useful for identifying plant genotypes that are tolerant to\nwater stress and salinity by measuring the stability of LWC even under\nartificially induced water stress [18, 25]. Such experiments generally employ\ndestructive procedures to obtain the LWC, which is time-consuming and labor\nintensive. Accordingly, this research has developed a non-destructive method to\nestimate LWC from UAV-based hyperspectral data.",

With such consideration, we\nadopt the idea of SignSGD in which only the signs of the gradients are\nexchanged. Moreover, most of the existing works assume Channel State\nInformation (CSI) available at both the mobile devices and the parameter\nserver, and thus the mobile devices can adopt fixed transmission rates dictated\nby the channel capacity. In this work, only the parameter server side CSI is\nassumed, and channel capacity with outage is considered. In this case, an\nessential problem for the mobile devices is to select appropriate local\nprocessing and communication parameters (including the transmission rates) to\nachieve a desired balance between the overall learning performance and their\nenergy consumption. Two optimization problems are formulated and solved, which\noptimize the learning performance given the energy consumption requirement, and\nvice versa. Furthermore, considering that the data may be distributed across\nthe mobile devices in a highly uneven fashion in FL, a stochastic sign-based\nalgorithm is proposed.

Proper selection of cuts would remove\ninfeasible solutions in the early stage, thus largely reducing the\ncomputational burden without hurting the solution accuracy. However, the major\ncut selection approaches heavily rely on heuristics, which strongly depend on\nthe specific problem at hand and thus limit their generalization capability. In\nthis paper, we propose a data-driven and generalizable cut selection approach,\nnamed Cut Ranking, in the settings of multiple instance learning. To measure\nthe quality of the candidate cuts, a scoring function, which takes the\ninstance-specific cut features as inputs, is trained and applied in cut ranking\nand selection. In order to evaluate our method, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets. Compared with\ncommonly used heuristics for cut selection, the learning-based policy has shown\nto be more effective, and is capable of generalizing over multiple problems\nwith different properties. Cut Ranking has been deployed in an industrial\nsolver for large-scale MIPs. In the online A/B testing of the product planning\nproblems with more than $10^7$ variables and constraints daily, Cut Ranking has\nachieved the average speedup ratio of 12.42% over the production solver without\nany accuracy loss of solution.",

In particular, our method developed is\ndriven by how functionally correlated brain structures vary together between\nautism and control groups. To do so, we devised a method based on a novel\ncombination of (1) non-Euclidean statistics that can faithfully represent\nnon-Euclidean data in Euclidean spaces and (2) a non-parametric integrative\nanalysis method that can decompose multi-block Euclidean data into joint,\nindividual, and residual structures. We find that the resulting joint structure\nis effective, robust, and interpretable in recognizing the underlying patterns\nof the joint variation of multi-block non-Euclidean data. We verified the\nmethod in classifying the structural shape data collected from cases that\ndeveloped and did not develop into Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD).",

Prior work\nexplored occlusion inference from observed social behaviors of road agents.\nInferring occupancy from agent behaviors is an inherently multimodal problem; a\ndriver may behave in the same manner for different occupancy patterns ahead of\nthem (e.g., a driver may move at constant speed in traffic or on an open road).\nPast work, however, does not account for this multimodality, thus neglecting to\nmodel this source of aleatoric uncertainty in the relationship between driver\nbehaviors and their environment. We propose an occlusion inference method that\ncharacterizes observed behaviors of human agents as sensor measurements, and\nfuses them with those from a standard sensor suite. To capture the aleatoric\nuncertainty, we train a conditional variational autoencoder with a discrete\nlatent space to learn a multimodal mapping from observed driver trajectories to\nan occupancy grid representation of the view ahead of the driver. Our method\nhandles multi-agent scenarios, combining measurements from multiple observed\ndrivers using evidential theory to solve the sensor fusion problem.

          "description": "We propose CX-ToM, short for counterfactual explanations with theory-of mind,\na new explainable AI (XAI) framework for explaining decisions made by a deep\nconvolutional neural network (CNN). In contrast to the current methods in XAI\nthat generate explanations as a single shot response, we pose explanation as an\niterative communication process, i.e. dialog, between the machine and human\nuser. More concretely, our CX-ToM framework generates sequence of explanations\nin a dialog by mediating the differences between the minds of machine and human\nuser. To do this, we use Theory of Mind (ToM) which helps us in explicitly\nmodeling human's intention, machine's mind as inferred by the human as well as\nhuman's mind as inferred by the machine. Moreover, most state-of-the-art XAI\nframeworks provide attention (or heat map) based explanations. In our work, we\nshow that these attention based explanations are not sufficient for increasing\nhuman trust in the underlying CNN model. In CX-ToM, we instead use\ncounterfactual explanations called fault-lines which we define as follows:\ngiven an input image I for which a CNN classification model M predicts class\nc_pred, a fault-line identifies the minimal semantic-level features (e.g.,\nstripes on zebra, pointed ears of dog), referred to as explainable concepts,\nthat need to be added to or deleted from I in order to alter the classification\ncategory of I by M to another specified class c_alt. We argue that, due to the\niterative, conceptual and counterfactual nature of CX-ToM explanations, our\nframework is practical and more natural for both expert and non-expert users to\nunderstand the internal workings of complex deep learning models. Extensive\nquantitative and qualitative experiments verify our hypotheses, demonstrating\nthat our CX-ToM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art explainable AI\nmodels.",

          "description": "Convolution neural networks have been successful in solving many socially\nimportant and economically significant problems. Their ability to learn complex\nhigh-dimensional functions hierarchically can be attributed to the use of\nnonlinear activation functions. A key discovery that made training deep\nnetworks feasible was the adoption of the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)\nactivation function to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem caused by using\nsaturating activation functions. Since then many improved variants of the ReLU\nactivation have been proposed. However a majority of activation functions used\ntoday are non-oscillatory and monotonically increasing due to their biological\nplausibility. This paper demonstrates that oscillatory activation functions can\nimprove gradient flow and reduce network size. It is shown that oscillatory\nactivation functions allow neurons to switch classification (sign of output)\nwithin the interior of neuronal hyperplane positive and negative half-spaces\nallowing complex decisions with fewer neurons. A new oscillatory activation\nfunction C(z) = z cos z that outperforms Sigmoids, Swish, Mish and ReLU on a\nvariety of architectures and benchmarks is presented. This new activation\nfunction allows even single neurons to exhibit nonlinear decision boundaries.\nThis paper presents a single neuron solution to the famous XOR problem.\nExperimental results indicate that replacing the activation function in the\nconvolutional layers with C(z) significantly improves performance on CIFAR-10,\nCIFAR-100 and Imagenette.",

          "description": "Multi-variate time series (MTS) data is a ubiquitous class of data\nabstraction in the real world. Any instance of MTS is generated from a hybrid\ndynamical system and their specific dynamics are usually unknown. The hybrid\nnature of such a dynamical system is a result of complex external attributes,\nsuch as geographic location and time of day, each of which can be categorized\ninto either spatial attributes or temporal attributes. Therefore, there are two\nfundamental views which can be used to analyze MTS data, namely the spatial\nview and the temporal view. Moreover, from each of these two views, we can\npartition the set of data samples of MTS into disjoint forecasting tasks in\naccordance with their associated attribute values. Then, samples of the same\ntask will manifest similar forthcoming pattern, which is less sophisticated to\nbe predicted in comparison with the original single-view setting. Considering\nthis insight, we propose a novel multi-view multi-task (MVMT) learning\nframework for MTS forecasting. Instead of being explicitly presented in most\nscenarios, MVMT information is deeply concealed in the MTS data, which severely\nhinders the model from capturing it naturally. To this end, we develop two\nkinds of basic operations, namely task-wise affine transformation and task-wise\nnormalization, respectively. Applying these two operations with prior knowledge\non the spatial and temporal view allows the model to adaptively extract MVMT\ninformation while predicting. Extensive experiments on three datasets are\nconducted to illustrate that canonical architectures can be greatly enhanced by\nthe MVMT learning framework in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. In\naddition, we design rich case studies to reveal the properties of\nrepresentations produced at different phases in the entire prediction\nprocedure.",

The core instrument to quantify entrainment is a linguistic\nsimilarity measure between conversational partners.

Motivated by this early-learning\nphenomenon, we propose a novel method to prevent memorization of the mislabeled\nsamples. Unlike the existing approaches which use the model output to identify\nor ignore the mislabeled samples, we introduce an indicator branch to the\noriginal model and enable the model to produce a confidence value for each\nsample. The confidence values are incorporated in our loss function which is\nlearned to assign large confidence values to correctly-labeled samples and\nsmall confidence values to mislabeled samples. We also propose an auxiliary\nregularization term to further improve the robustness of the model. To improve\nthe performance, we gradually correct the noisy labels with a well-designed\ntarget estimation strategy.

          "description": "Growing use of machine learning in policy and social impact settings have\nraised concerns for fairness implications, especially for racial minorities.\nThese concerns have generated considerable interest among machine learning and\nartificial intelligence researchers, who have developed new methods and\nestablished theoretical bounds for improving fairness, focusing on the source\ndata, regularization and model training, or post-hoc adjustments to model\nscores. However, little work has studied the practical trade-offs between\nfairness and accuracy in real-world settings to understand how these bounds and\nmethods translate into policy choices and impact on society. Our empirical\nstudy fills this gap by investigating the impact of mitigating disparities on\naccuracy, focusing on the common context of using machine learning to inform\nbenefit allocation in resource-constrained programs across education, mental\nhealth, criminal justice, and housing safety. Here we describe applied work in\nwhich we find fairness-accuracy trade-offs to be negligible in practice. In\neach setting studied, explicitly focusing on achieving equity and using our\nproposed post-hoc disparity mitigation methods, fairness was substantially\nimproved without sacrificing accuracy. This observation was robust across\npolicy contexts studied, scale of resources available for intervention, time,\nand relative size of the protected groups. These empirical results challenge a\ncommonly held assumption that reducing disparities either requires accepting an\nappreciable drop in accuracy or the development of novel, complex methods,\nmaking reducing disparities in these applications more practical.",

          "description": "Several scalable sample-based methods to compute the Kullback Leibler (KL)\ndivergence between two distributions have been proposed and applied in\nlarge-scale machine learning models. While they have been found to be unstable,\nthe theoretical root cause of the problem is not clear. In this paper, we study\na generative adversarial network based approach that uses a neural network\ndiscriminator to estimate KL divergence. We argue that, in such case, high\nfluctuations in the estimates are a consequence of not controlling the\ncomplexity of the discriminator function space. We provide a theoretical\nunderpinning and remedy for this problem by first constructing a discriminator\nin the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). This enables us to leverage\nsample complexity and mean embedding to theoretically relate the error\nprobability bound of the KL estimates to the complexity of the discriminator in\nRKHS. Based on this theory, we then present a scalable way to control the\ncomplexity of the discriminator for a reliable estimation of KL divergence. We\nsupport both our proposed theory and method to control the complexity of the\nRKHS discriminator through controlled experiments.",

          "description": "Online continual learning for image classification studies the problem of\nlearning to classify images from an online stream of data and tasks, where\ntasks may include new classes (class incremental) or data nonstationarity\n(domain incremental). One of the key challenges of continual learning is to\navoid catastrophic forgetting (CF), i.e., forgetting old tasks in the presence\nof more recent tasks. Over the past few years, many methods and tricks have\nbeen introduced to address this problem, but many have not been fairly and\nsystematically compared under a variety of realistic and practical settings. To\nbetter understand the relative advantages of various approaches and the\nsettings where they work best, this survey aims to (1) compare state-of-the-art\nmethods such as MIR, iCARL, and GDumb and determine which works best at\ndifferent experimental settings; (2) determine if the best class incremental\nmethods are also competitive in domain incremental setting; (3) evaluate the\nperformance of 7 simple but effective trick such as \"review\" trick and nearest\nclass mean (NCM) classifier to assess their relative impact. Regarding (1), we\nobserve iCaRL remains competitive when the memory buffer is small; GDumb\noutperforms many recently proposed methods in medium-size datasets and MIR\nperforms the best in larger-scale datasets. For (2), we note that GDumb\nperforms quite poorly while MIR -- already competitive for (1) -- is also\nstrongly competitive in this very different but important setting. Overall,\nthis allows us to conclude that MIR is overall a strong and versatile method\nacross a wide variety of settings. For (3), we find that all 7 tricks are\nbeneficial, and when augmented with the \"review\" trick and NCM classifier, MIR\nproduces performance levels that bring online continual learning much closer to\nits ultimate goal of matching offline training.",

However, the question which of these detected\nplanets are habitable, potentially-habitable, or maybe even inhabited, is still\nnot answered. Some potentially habitable exoplanets have been hypothesized, but\nsince Earth is the only known habitable planet, measures of habitability are\nnecessarily determined with Earth as the reference. Several recent works\nintroduced new habitability metrics based on optimization methods.\nClassification of potentially habitable exoplanets using supervised learning is\nanother emerging area of study.

We propose an anomaly detection method, the\nMulti-Stage Memetic Algorithm (MSMA), to detect anomalies and extend it to an\nunsupervised clustering algorithm MSMVMCA to use it to detect potentially\nhabitable exoplanets as anomalies. The algorithm is based on the postulate that\nEarth is an anomaly, with the possibility of existence of few other anomalies\namong thousands of data points. We describe an MSMA-based clustering approach\nwith a novel distance function to detect habitable candidates as anomalies\n(including Earth).

The FBCNN-2D\nutilizes a filter bank to create sub-band components of the\nelectroencephalography (EEG) signal, which it transforms using the fast Fourier\ntransform (FFT) and analyzes with a 2D CNN. The FBCNN-3D utilizes the same\nfilter bank, but it transforms the sub-band components into spectrograms via\nshort-time Fourier transform (STFT), and analyzes them with a 3D CNN. We made\nuse of transfer learning. To train the FBCNN-3D, we proposed a new technique,\ncalled inter-dimensional transfer learning, to transfer knowledge from a 2D DNN\nto a 3D DNN. Our BCI was conceived so as not to require calibration from the\nfinal user: therefore, the test subject data was separated from training and\nvalidation.\n\nResults: The mean test accuracy was 85.7% for the FBCCA-2D and 85% for the\nFBCCA-3D. Mean F1-Scores were 0.858 and 0.853. Alternative classification\nmethods, SVM, FBCCA and a CNN, had mean accuracy of 79.2%, 80.1% and 81.4%,\nrespectively.\n\nConclusion: The FBCNNs surpassed traditional SSVEP classification methods in\nour simulated BCI, by a considerable margin (about 5% higher accuracy).\nTransfer learning and inter-dimensional transfer learning made training much\nfaster and more predictable.\n\nSignificance: We proposed a new and flexible type of DNN, which had a better\nperformance than standard methods in SSVEP classification for portable and fast\nBCIs.",

          "description": "Koopman spectral theory has provided a new perspective in the field of\ndynamical systems in recent years. Modern dynamical systems are becoming\nincreasingly non-linear and complex, and there is a need for a framework to\nmodel these systems in a compact and comprehensive representation for\nprediction and control. The central problem in applying Koopman theory to a\nsystem of interest is that the choice of finite-dimensional basis functions is\ntypically done apriori, using expert knowledge of the systems dynamics. Our\napproach learns these basis functions using a supervised learning approach\nwhere a combination of autoencoders and deep neural networks learn the basis\nfunctions for any given system. We demonstrate this approach on a simple\npendulum example in which we obtain a linear representation of the non-linear\nsystem and then predict the future state trajectories given some initial\nconditions. We also explore how changing the input representation of the\ndynamic systems time series data can impact the quality of learned basis\nfunctions. This alternative representation is compared to the traditional raw\ntime series data approach to determine which method results in lower\nreconstruction and prediction error of the true non-linear dynamics of the\nsystem.",

          "description": "The task of learning from only a few examples (called a few-shot setting) is\nof key importance and relevance to a real-world setting. For question answering\n(QA), the current state-of-the-art pre-trained models typically need\nfine-tuning on tens of thousands of examples to obtain good results. Their\nperformance degrades significantly in a few-shot setting (< 100 examples). To\naddress this, we propose a simple fine-tuning framework that leverages\npre-trained text-to-text models and is directly aligned with their pre-training\nframework. Specifically, we construct the input as a concatenation of the\nquestion, a mask token representing the answer span and a context. Given this\ninput, the model is fine-tuned using the same objective as that of its\npre-training objective. Through experimental studies on various few-shot\nconfigurations, we show that this formulation leads to significant gains on\nmultiple QA benchmarks (an absolute gain of 34.2 F1 points on average when\nthere are only 16 training examples). The gains extend further when used with\nlarger models (Eg:- 72.3 F1 on SQuAD using BART-large with only 32 examples)\nand translate well to a multilingual setting . On the multilingual TydiQA\nbenchmark, our model outperforms the XLM-Roberta-large by an absolute margin of\nupto 40 F1 points and an average of 33 F1 points in a few-shot setting (<= 64\ntraining examples). We conduct detailed ablation studies to analyze factors\ncontributing to these gains.",

          "description": "Firms earning prediction plays a vital role in investment decisions,\ndividends expectation, and share price. It often involves multiple\ntensor-compatible datasets with non-linear multi-way relationships,\nspatiotemporal structures, and different levels of sparsity. Current non-linear\ntensor completion algorithms tend to learn noisy embedding and incur\noverfitting. This paper focuses on the embedding learning aspect of the tensor\ncompletion problem and proposes a new multi-layer neural network architecture\nfor tensor factorization and completion (MLCTR). The network architecture\nentails multiple advantages: a series of low-rank matrix factorizations (MF)\nbuilding blocks to minimize overfitting, interleaved transfer functions in each\nlayer for non-linearity, and by-pass connections to reduce the gradient\ndiminishing problem and increase the depths of neural networks. Furthermore,\nthe model employs Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) based optimization for fast\nconvergence in training. Our algorithm is highly efficient for imputing missing\nvalues in the EPS data. Experiments confirm that our strategy of incorporating\nnon-linearity in factor matrices demonstrates impressive performance in\nembedding learning and end-to-end tensor models, and outperforms approaches\nwith non-linearity in the phase of reconstructing tensors from factor matrices.",

          "description": "For the Domain Generalization (DG) problem where the hypotheses are composed\nof a common representation function followed by a labeling function, we point\nout a shortcoming in existing approaches that fail to explicitly optimize for a\nterm, appearing in a well-known and widely adopted upper bound to the risk on\nthe unseen domain, that is dependent on the representation to be learned. To\nthis end, we first derive a novel upper bound to the prediction risk. We show\nthat imposing a mild assumption on the representation to be learned, namely\nmanifold restricted invertibility, is sufficient to deal with this issue.\nFurther, unlike existing approaches, our novel upper bound doesn't require the\nassumption of Lipschitzness of the loss function. In addition, the\ndistributional discrepancy in the representation space is handled via the\nWasserstein-2 barycenter cost. In this context, we creatively leverage old and\nrecent transport inequalities, which link various optimal transport metrics, in\nparticular the $L^1$ distance (also known as the total variation distance) and\nthe Wasserstein-2 distances, with the Kullback-Liebler divergence. These\nanalyses and insights motivate a new representation learning cost for DG that\nadditively balances three competing objectives: 1) minimizing classification\nerror across seen domains via cross-entropy, 2) enforcing domain-invariance in\nthe representation space via the Wasserstein-2 barycenter cost, and 3)\npromoting non-degenerate, nearly-invertible representation via one of two\nmechanisms, viz., an autoencoder-based reconstruction loss or a mutual\ninformation loss. It is to be noted that the proposed algorithms completely\nbypass the use of any adversarial training mechanism that is typical of many\ncurrent domain generalization approaches. Simulation results on several\nstandard datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to several\nwell-known DG algorithms.",

          "description": "The rapid recent progress in machine learning (ML) has raised a number of\nscientific questions that challenge the longstanding dogma of the field. One of\nthe most important riddles is the good empirical generalization of\noverparameterized models. Overparameterized models are excessively complex with\nrespect to the size of the training dataset, which results in them perfectly\nfitting (i.e., interpolating) the training data, which is usually noisy. Such\ninterpolation of noisy data is traditionally associated with detrimental\noverfitting, and yet a wide range of interpolating models -- from simple linear\nmodels to deep neural networks -- have recently been observed to generalize\nextremely well on fresh test data. Indeed, the recently discovered double\ndescent phenomenon has revealed that highly overparameterized models often\nimprove over the best underparameterized model in test performance.\n\nUnderstanding learning in this overparameterized regime requires new theory\nand foundational empirical studies, even for the simplest case of the linear\nmodel. The underpinnings of this understanding have been laid in very recent\nanalyses of overparameterized linear regression and related statistical\nlearning tasks, which resulted in precise analytic characterizations of double\ndescent. This paper provides a succinct overview of this emerging theory of\noverparameterized ML (henceforth abbreviated as TOPML) that explains these\nrecent findings through a statistical signal processing perspective. We\nemphasize the unique aspects that define the TOPML research area as a subfield\nof modern ML theory and outline interesting open questions that remain.",

          "description": "It is notoriously difficult to control the behavior of reinforcement learning\nagents. Agents often learn to exploit the environment or reward signal and need\nto be retrained multiple times. The multi-objective reinforcement learning\n(MORL) framework separates a reward function into several objectives. An ideal\nMORL agent learns to generalize to novel combinations of objectives allowing\nfor better control of an agent's behavior without requiring retraining. Many\nMORL approaches use a weight vector to parameterize the importance of each\nobjective. However, this approach suffers from lack of expressiveness and\ninterpretability. We propose using propositional logic to specify the\nimportance of multiple objectives. By using a logic where predicates correspond\ndirectly to objectives, specifications are inherently more interpretable.\nAdditionally the set of specifications that can be expressed with formal\nlanguages is a superset of what can be expressed by weight vectors. In this\npaper, we define a formal language based on propositional logic with\nquantitative semantics. We encode logical specifications using a recurrent\nneural network and show that MORL agents parameterized by these encodings are\nable to generalize to novel specifications over objectives and achieve\nperformance comparable to single objective baselines.",

Our methodology achieves results that are competitive\nwith the supervised approaches and close the gap through fine-tuning a network\nwhile learning the downstream tasks in most cases.

While advanced analytics tasks over time series data have been gaining\nlots of attention, lack of such community resources severely limits scientific\nprogress. In this paper, we present Exathlon, the first comprehensive public\nbenchmark for explainable anomaly detection over high-dimensional time series\ndata. Exathlon has been systematically constructed based on real data traces\nfrom repeated executions of large-scale stream processing jobs on an Apache\nSpark cluster. Some of these executions were intentionally disturbed by\nintroducing instances of six different types of anomalous events (e.g.,\nmisbehaving inputs, resource contention, process failures). For each of the\nanomaly instances, ground truth labels for the root cause interval as well as\nthose for the extended effect interval are provided, supporting the development\nand evaluation of a wide range of anomaly detection (AD) and explanation\ndiscovery (ED) tasks. We demonstrate the practical utility of Exathlon's\ndataset, evaluation methodology, and end-to-end data science pipeline design\nthrough an experimental study with three state-of-the-art AD and ED techniques.",

          "description": "Quantum Annealing (QA) was originally intended for accelerating the solution\nof combinatorial optimization tasks that have natural encodings as Ising\nmodels. However, recent experiments on QA hardware platforms have demonstrated\nthat, in the operating regime corresponding to weak interactions, the QA\nhardware behaves like a noisy Gibbs sampler at a hardware-specific effective\ntemperature. This work builds on those insights and identifies a class of small\nhardware-native Ising models that are robust to noise effects and proposes a\nnovel procedure for executing these models on QA hardware to maximize Gibbs\nsampling performance. Experimental results indicate that the proposed protocol\nresults in high-quality Gibbs samples from a hardware-specific effective\ntemperature and that the QA annealing time can be used to adjust the effective\ntemperature of the output distribution. The procedure proposed in this work\nprovides a new approach to using QA hardware for Ising model sampling\npresenting potential new opportunities for applications in machine learning and\nphysics simulation.",

At test time, given a single unposed image of\nan unseen object, CodeNeRF jointly estimates camera viewpoint, and shape and\nappearance codes via optimization. Unseen objects can be reconstructed from a\nsingle image, and then rendered from new viewpoints or their shape and texture\nedited by varying the latent codes. We conduct experiments on the SRN\nbenchmark, which show that CodeNeRF generalises well to unseen objects and\nachieves on-par performance with methods that require known camera pose at test\ntime.

          "description": "For the high dimensional data representation, nonnegative tensor ring (NTR)\ndecomposition equipped with manifold learning has become a promising model to\nexploit the multi-dimensional structure and extract the feature from tensor\ndata.

For\ntensor data with complex manifold structure, the graph can not exactly\nconstruct similarity relationships. In this paper, in order to effectively\nutilize the higher-dimensional and complicated similarities among objects, we\nintroduce hypergraph to the framework of NTR to further enhance the feature\nextraction, upon which a hypergraph regularized nonnegative tensor ring\ndecomposition (HGNTR) method is developed. To reduce the computational\ncomplexity and suppress the noise, we apply the low-rank approximation trick to\naccelerate HGNTR (called LraHGNTR). Our experimental results show that compared\nwith other state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed HGNTR and LraHGNTR can\nachieve higher performance in clustering tasks, in addition, LraHGNTR can\ngreatly reduce running time without decreasing accuracy.",

          "description": "Communication has been seen as a significant bottleneck in industrial\napplications over large-scale networks. To alleviate the communication burden,\nsign-based optimization algorithms have gained popularity recently in both\nindustrial and academic communities, which is shown to be closely related to\nadaptive gradient methods, such as Adam. Along this line, this paper\ninvestigates faster convergence for a variant of sign-based gradient descent,\ncalled scaled signGD, in three cases: 1) the objective function is strongly\nconvex; 2) the objective function is nonconvex but satisfies the\nPolyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequality; 3) the gradient is stochastic, called\nscaled signGD in this case. For the first two cases, it can be shown that the\nscaled signGD converges at a linear rate. For case 3), the algorithm is shown\nto converge linearly to a neighborhood of the optimal value when a constant\nlearning rate is employed, and the algorithm converges at a rate of $O(1/k)$\nwhen using a diminishing learning rate, where $k$ is the iteration number. The\nresults are also extended to the distributed setting by majority vote in a\nparameter-server framework. Finally, numerical experiments on logistic\nregression are performed to corroborate the theoretical findings.",

In this paper, in contrast to strict MV\ncontrol, we consider learning MV efficient policies that achieve Pareto\nefficiency regarding MV trade-off. To achieve this purpose, we train an agent\nto maximize the expected quadratic utility function, a common objective of risk\nmanagement in finance and economics.

          "description": "In this paper, we consider the problem of training neural network (NN)\ncontrollers for nonlinear dynamical systems that are guaranteed to satisfy\nsafety and liveness (e.g., reach-avoid) properties. Our approach is to combine\nmodel-based design methodologies for dynamical systems with data-driven\napproaches to achieve this target. We confine our attention to NNs with\nRectifier Linear Unit (ReLU) nonlinearity which are known to represent\nContinuous Piece-Wise Affine (CPWA) functions. Given a mathematical model of\nthe dynamical system, we compute a finite-state abstract model that captures\nthe closed-loop behavior under all possible CPWA controllers. Using this\nfinite-state abstract model, our framework identifies a family of CPWA\nfunctions guaranteed to satisfy the safety requirements. We augment the\nlearning algorithm with a NN weight projection operator during training that\nenforces the resulting NN to represent a CPWA function from the provably safe\nfamily of CPWA functions. Moreover, the proposed framework uses the\nfinite-state abstract model to identify candidate CPWA functions that may\nsatisfy the liveness properties. Using such candidate CPWA functions, the\nproposed framework biases the NN training to achieve the liveness\nspecification. We show the efficacy of the proposed framework both in\nsimulation and on an actual robotic vehicle.",

          "description": "Trip recommendation is a significant and engaging location-based service that\ncan help new tourists make more customized travel plans. It often attempts to\nsuggest a sequence of point of interests (POIs) for a user who requests a\npersonalized travel demand. Conventional methods either leverage the heuristic\nalgorithms (e.g., dynamic programming) or statistical analysis (e.g., Markov\nmodels) to search or rank a POI sequence. These procedures may fail to capture\nthe diversity of human needs and transitional regularities. They even provide\nrecommendations that deviate from tourists' real travel intention when the trip\ndata is sparse. Although recent deep recursive models (e.g., RNN) are capable\nof alleviating these concerns, existing solutions hardly recognize the\npractical reality, such as the diversity of tourist demands, uncertainties in\nthe trip generation, and the complex visiting preference. Inspired by the\nadvance in deep learning, we introduce a novel self-supervised representation\nlearning framework for trip recommendation -- SelfTrip, aiming at tackling the\naforementioned challenges. Specifically, we propose a two-step contrastive\nlearning mechanism concerning the POI representation, as well as trip\nrepresentation. Furthermore, we present four trip augmentation methods to\ncapture the visiting uncertainties in trip planning. We evaluate our SelfTrip\non four real-world datasets, and extensive results demonstrate the promising\ngain compared with several cutting-edge benchmarks, e.g., up to 4% and 12% on\nF1 and pair-F1, respectively.",

          "description": "Practical recommender systems experience a cold-start problem when observed\nuser-item interactions in the history are insufficient. Meta learning,\nespecially gradient based one, can be adopted to tackle this problem by\nlearning initial parameters of the model and thus allowing fast adaptation to a\nspecific task from limited data examples. Though with significant performance\nimprovement, it commonly suffers from two critical issues: the\nnon-compatibility with mainstream industrial deployment and the heavy\ncomputational burdens, both due to the inner-loop gradient operation. These two\nissues make them hard to be applied in practical recommender systems. To enjoy\nthe benefits of meta learning framework and mitigate these problems, we propose\na recommendation framework called Contextual Modulation Meta Learning (CMML).\nCMML is composed of fully feed-forward operations so it is computationally\nefficient and completely compatible with the mainstream industrial deployment.\nCMML consists of three components, including a context encoder that can\ngenerate context embedding to represent a specific task, a hybrid context\ngenerator that aggregates specific user-item features with task-level context,\nand a contextual modulation network, which can modulate the recommendation\nmodel to adapt effectively. We validate our approach on both scenario-specific\nand user-specific cold-start setting on various real-world datasets, showing\nCMML can achieve comparable or even better performance with gradient based\nmethods yet with much higher computational efficiency and better\ninterpretability.",

Specifically, we propose a new network structure called\nCompression Network with Transformer (CNT) to compress the feature into a low\ndimensional space, and an inhomogeneous neighborhood relationship preserving\n(INRP) loss that aims to maintain high search accuracy. In CNT, we use multiple\ncompression projections to cast the feature into many low dimensional spaces,\nand then use transformer to globally optimize these projections such that the\nfeatures are well compressed following the guidance from our loss function. The\nloss function is designed to assign high weights on point pairs that are close\nin original feature space, and keep their distances in projected space. Keeping\nthese distances helps maintain the eventual top-k retrieval accuracy, and down\nweighting others creates room for feature compression. In experiments, we run\nour compression method on public datasets, and use the compressed features in\ngraph based, product quantization and scalar quantization based ANNS solutions.\nExperimental results show that our compression method can significantly improve\nthe efficiency of these methods while preserves or even improves search\naccuracy, suggesting its broad potential impact on real world applications.",

          "description": "Rating prediction is a core problem in recommender systems to quantify users\npreferences towards different items. Due to the imbalanced rating distributions\nin training data, existing recommendation methods suffer from the biased\nprediction problem that generates biased prediction results. Thus, their\nperformance on predicting ratings which rarely appear in training data is\nunsatisfactory. In this paper, inspired by the superior capability of Extreme\nValue Distribution (EVD)-based methods in modeling the distribution of rare\ndata, we propose a novel \\underline{\\emph{G}}umbel Distribution-based\n\\underline{\\emph{R}}ating \\underline{\\emph{P}}rediction framework (GRP) which\ncan accurately predict both frequent and rare ratings between users and items.\nIn our approach, we first define different Gumbel distributions for each rating\nlevel, which can be learned by historical rating statistics of users and items.\nSecond, we incorporate the Gumbel-based representations of users and items with\ntheir original representations learned from the rating matrix and/or reviews to\nenrich the representations of users and items via a proposed multi-scale\nconvolutional fusion layer. Third, we propose a data-driven rating prediction\nmodule to predict the ratings of user-item pairs. It's worthy to note that our\napproach can be readily applied to existing recommendation methods for\naddressing their biased prediction problem. To verify the effectiveness of GRP,\nwe conduct extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets. Compared with\nseveral baseline models, the results show that: 1) GRP achieves\nstate-of-the-art overall performance on all eight datasets; 2) GRP makes a\nsubstantial improvement in predicting rare ratings, which shows the\neffectiveness of our model in addressing the bias prediction problem.",

          "description": "Digital maps are commonly used across the globe for exploring places that\nusers are interested in, commonly referred to as points of interest (PoI). In\nonline food delivery platforms, PoIs could represent any major private\ncompounds where customers could order from such as hospitals, residential\ncomplexes, office complexes, educational institutes and hostels. In this work,\nwe propose an end-to-end unsupervised system design for obtaining polygon\nrepresentations of PoIs (PoI polygons) from address locations and address\ntexts. We preprocess the address texts using locality names and generate\nembeddings for the address texts using a deep learning-based architecture, viz.\nRoBERTa, trained on our internal address dataset. The PoI candidates are\nidentified by jointly clustering the anonymised customer phone GPS locations\n(obtained during address onboarding) and the embeddings of the address texts.\nThe final list of PoI polygons is obtained from these PoI candidates using\nnovel post-processing steps. This algorithm identified 74.8 % more PoIs than\nthose obtained using the Mummidi-Krumm baseline algorithm run on our internal\ndataset. The proposed algorithm achieves a median area precision of 98 %, a\nmedian area recall of 8 %, and a median F-score of 0.15. In order to improve\nthe recall of the algorithmic polygons, we post-process them using building\nfootprint polygons from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) database. The post-processing\nalgorithm involves reshaping the algorithmic polygon using intersecting\npolygons and closed private roads from the OSM database, and accounting for\nintersection with public roads on the OSM database.

          "description": "Representation learning using network embedding has received tremendous\nattention due to its efficacy to solve downstream tasks.

QUINT is the first of its kind that provides\ntremendous gain in terms of speed and space usage without compromising much on\nthe accuracy of the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted to\ncompare QUINT with seven state-of-the-art network embedding methods for two end\ntasks - link prediction and node classification. We observe huge performance\ngain for QUINT in terms of speedup (up to 7000x) and space saving (up to 800x)\ndue to its bit-wise nature to obtain node embedding. Moreover, QUINT is a\nconsistent top-performer for both the tasks among the baselines across all the\ndatasets.

          "description": "With the prevalence of social media, there has recently been a proliferation\nof recommenders that shift their focus from individual modeling to group\nrecommendation. Since the group preference is a mixture of various\npredilections from group members, the fundamental challenge of group\nrecommendation is to model the correlations among members. Existing methods\nmostly adopt heuristic or attention-based preference aggregation strategies to\nsynthesize group preferences. However, these models mainly focus on the\npairwise connections of users and ignore the complex high-order interactions\nwithin and beyond groups. Besides, group recommendation suffers seriously from\nthe problem of data sparsity due to severely sparse group-item interactions. In\nthis paper, we propose a self-supervised hypergraph learning framework for\ngroup recommendation to achieve two goals: (1) capturing the intra- and\ninter-group interactions among users; (2) alleviating the data sparsity issue\nwith the raw data itself. Technically, for (1), a hierarchical hypergraph\nconvolutional network based on the user- and group-level hypergraphs is\ndeveloped to model the complex tuplewise correlations among users within and\nbeyond groups. For (2), we design a double-scale node dropout strategy to\ncreate self-supervision signals that can regularize user representations with\ndifferent granularities against the sparsity issue. The experimental analysis\non multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed\nmodel and also elucidates the rationality of the hypergraph modeling and the\ndouble-scale self-supervision.",

          "description": "The role of recommendation systems in the diversity of content consumption on\nplatforms is a much-debated issue. The quantitative state of the art often\noverlooks the existence of individual attitudes toward guidance, and eventually\nof different categories of users in this regard. Focusing on the case of music\nstreaming, we analyze the complete listening history of about 9k users over one\nyear and demonstrate that there is no blanket answer to the intertwinement of\nrecommendation use and consumption diversity: it depends on users. First we\ncompute for each user the relative importance of different access modes within\ntheir listening history, introducing a trichotomy distinguishing so-called\n`organic' use from algorithmic and editorial guidance. We thereby identify four\ncategories of users. We then focus on two scales related to content diversity,\nboth in terms of dispersion -- how much users consume the same content\nrepeatedly -- and popularity -- how popular is the content they consume. We\nshow that the two types of recommendation offered by music platforms --\nalgorithmic and editorial -- may drive the consumption of more or less diverse\ncontent in opposite directions, depending also strongly on the type of users.\nFinally, we compare users' streaming histories with the music programming of a\nselection of popular French radio stations during the same period. While radio\nprograms are usually more tilted toward repetition than users' listening\nhistories, they often program more songs from less popular artists. On the\nwhole, our results highlight the nontrivial effects of platform-mediated\nrecommendation on consumption, and lead us to speak of `filter niches' rather\nthan `filter bubbles'. They hint at further ramifications for the study and\ndesign of recommendation systems.",

          "description": "Compliments and concerns in reviews are valuable for understanding users'\nshopping interests and their opinions with respect to specific aspects of\ncertain items. Existing review-based recommenders favor large and complex\nlanguage encoders that can only learn latent and uninterpretable text\nrepresentations. They lack explicit user attention and item property modeling,\nwhich however could provide valuable information beyond the ability to\nrecommend items. Therefore, we propose a tightly coupled two-stage approach,\nincluding an Aspect-Sentiment Pair Extractor (ASPE) and an\nAttention-Property-aware Rating Estimator (APRE). Unsupervised ASPE mines\nAspect-Sentiment pairs (AS-pairs) and APRE predicts ratings using AS-pairs as\nconcrete aspect-level evidence. Extensive experiments on seven real-world\nAmazon Review Datasets demonstrate that ASPE can effectively extract AS-pairs\nwhich enable APRE to deliver superior accuracy over the leading baselines.",

          "description": "Existing neural information retrieval (IR) models have often been studied in\nhomogeneous and narrow settings, which has considerably limited insights into\ntheir out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization capabilities. To address this,\nand to facilitate researchers to broadly evaluate the effectiveness of their\nmodels, we introduce Benchmarking-IR (BEIR), a robust and heterogeneous\nevaluation benchmark for information retrieval. We leverage a careful selection\nof 18 publicly available datasets from diverse text retrieval tasks and domains\nand evaluate 10 state-of-the-art retrieval systems including lexical, sparse,\ndense, late-interaction and re-ranking architectures on the BEIR benchmark. Our\nresults show BM25 is a robust baseline and re-ranking and\nlate-interaction-based models on average achieve the best zero-shot\nperformances, however, at high computational costs. In contrast, dense and\nsparse-retrieval models are computationally more efficient but often\nunderperform other approaches, highlighting the considerable room for\nimprovement in their generalization capabilities. We hope this framework allows\nus to better evaluate and understand existing retrieval systems, and\ncontributes to accelerating progress towards better robust and generalizable\nsystems in the future.

          "description": "Recommender systems rely on user behavior data like ratings and clicks to\nbuild personalization model. However, the collected data is observational\nrather than experimental, causing various biases in the data which\nsignificantly affect the learned model. Most existing work for recommendation\ndebiasing, such as the inverse propensity scoring and imputation approaches,\nfocuses on one or two specific biases, lacking the universal capacity that can\naccount for mixed or even unknown biases in the data. Towards this research\ngap, we first analyze the origin of biases from the perspective of \\textit{risk\ndiscrepancy} that represents the difference between the expectation empirical\nrisk and the true risk. Remarkably, we derive a general learning framework that\nwell summarizes most existing debiasing strategies by specifying some\nparameters of the general framework. This provides a valuable opportunity to\ndevelop a universal solution for debiasing, e.g., by learning the debiasing\nparameters from data. However, the training data lacks important signal of how\nthe data is biased and what the unbiased data looks like. To move this idea\nforward, we propose \\textit{AotoDebias} that leverages another (small) set of\nuniform data to optimize the debiasing parameters by solving the bi-level\noptimization problem with meta-learning. Through theoretical analyses, we\nderive the generalization bound for AutoDebias and prove its ability to acquire\nthe appropriate debiasing strategy. Extensive experiments on two real datasets\nand a simulated dataset demonstrated effectiveness of AutoDebias. The code is\navailable at \\url{https://github.com/DongHande/AutoDebias}.",

          "description": "Popular music streaming platforms offer users a diverse network of content\nexploration through a triad of affordances: organic, algorithmic and editorial\naccess modes. Whilst offering great potential for discovery, such platform\ndevelopments also pose the modern user with daily adoption decisions on two\nfronts: platform affordance adoption and the adoption of recommendations\ntherein. Following a carefully constrained set of Deezer users over a 2-year\nobservation period, our work explores factors driving user behaviour in the\nbroad sense, by differentiating users on the basis of their temporal daily\nusage, adoption of the main platform affordances, and the ways in which they\nreact to them, especially in terms of recommendation adoption. Diverging from a\nperspective common in studies on the effects of recommendation, we assume and\nconfirm that users exhibit very diverse behaviours in using and adopting the\nplatform affordances. The resulting complex and quite heterogeneous picture\ndemonstrates that there is no blanket answer for adoption practices of both\nrecommendation features and recommendations.",

          "description": "Current app ranking and recommendation systems are mainly based on\nuser-generated information, e.g., number of downloads and ratings. However, new\napps often have few (or even no) user feedback, suffering from the classic\ncold-start problem. How to quickly identify and then recommend new apps of high\nquality is a challenging issue. Here, a fundamental requirement is the\ncapability to accurately measure an app's quality based on its inborn features,\nrather than user-generated features. Since users obtain first-hand experience\nof an app by interacting with its views, we speculate that the inborn features\nare largely related to the visual quality of individual views in an app and the\nways the views switch to one another. In this work, we propose AppQ, a novel\napp quality grading and recommendation system that extracts inborn features of\napps based on app source code. In particular, AppQ works in parallel to perform\ncode analysis to extract app-level features as well as dynamic analysis to\ncapture view-level layout hierarchy and the switching among views. Each app is\nthen expressed as an attributed view graph, which is converted into a vector\nand fed to classifiers for recognizing its quality classes. Our evaluation with\nan app dataset from Google Play reports that AppQ achieves the best performance\nwith accuracy of 85.0\\%. This shows a lot of promise to warm-start app grading\nand recommendation systems with AppQ.",

          "description": "Knowledge Distillation (KD), which transfers the knowledge of a well-trained\nlarge model (teacher) to a small model (student), has become an important area\nof research for practical deployment of recommender systems. Recently, Relaxed\nRanking Distillation (RRD) has shown that distilling the ranking information in\nthe recommendation list significantly improves the performance. However, the\nmethod still has limitations in that 1) it does not fully utilize the\nprediction errors of the student model, which makes the training not fully\nefficient, and 2) it only distills the user-side ranking information, which\nprovides an insufficient view under the sparse implicit feedback. This paper\npresents Dual Correction strategy for Distillation (DCD), which transfers the\nranking information from the teacher model to the student model in a more\nefficient manner. Most importantly, DCD uses the discrepancy between the\nteacher model and the student model predictions to decide which knowledge to be\ndistilled. By doing so, DCD essentially provides the learning guidance tailored\nto \"correcting\" what the student model has failed to accurately predict. This\nprocess is applied for transferring the ranking information from the user-side\nas well as the item-side to address sparse implicit user feedback. Our\nexperiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art\nbaselines, and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component.",

          "description": "Pretrained contextualized representations offer great success for many\ndownstream tasks, including document ranking. The multilingual versions of such\npretrained representations provide a possibility of jointly learning many\nlanguages with the same model. Although it is expected to gain big with such\njoint training, in the case of cross lingual information retrieval (CLIR), the\nmodels under a multilingual setting are not achieving the same level of\nperformance as those under a monolingual setting. We hypothesize that the\nperformance drop is due to the translation gap between query and documents. In\nthe monolingual retrieval task, because of the same lexical inputs, it is\neasier for model to identify the query terms that occurred in documents.\nHowever, in the multilingual pretrained models that the words in different\nlanguages are projected into the same hyperspace, the model tends to translate\nquery terms into related terms, i.e., terms that appear in a similar context,\nin addition to or sometimes rather than synonyms in the target language. This\nproperty is creating difficulties for the model to connect terms that cooccur\nin both query and document. To address this issue, we propose a novel Mixed\nAttention Transformer (MAT) that incorporates external word level knowledge,\nsuch as a dictionary or translation table. We design a sandwich like\narchitecture to embed MAT into the recent transformer based deep neural models.\nBy encoding the translation knowledge into an attention matrix, the model with\nMAT is able to focus on the mutually translated words in the input sequence.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the external knowledge\nand the significant improvement of MAT embedded neural reranking model on CLIR\ntask.",

We\nexpand the variational autoencoder collaborative filtering from a single-domain\nto a multi-domain setting. The intuition is that user-item interactions in a\nsource domain can augment the recommendation quality in a target domain. The\nintuition can be taken to its extreme, where, in a cross-domain setup, the user\nhistory in a source domain is enough to generate high-quality recommendations\nin a target one. We thus create a Product-of-Experts (POE) architecture for\nrecommendations that jointly models user-item interactions across multiple\ndomains. The method is resilient to missing data for one or more of the\ndomains, which is a situation often found in real life. We present results on\ntwo widely-used datasets - Amazon and Yelp, which support the claim that\nholistic user preference knowledge leads to better recommendations.\nSurprisingly, we find that in some cases, a POE recommender that does not\naccess the target domain user representation can surpass a strong VAE\nrecommender baseline trained on the target domain.",

          "description": "Existing unsupervised document hashing methods are mostly established on\ngenerative models. Due to the difficulties of capturing long dependency\nstructures, these methods rarely model the raw documents directly, but instead\nto model the features extracted from them (e.g. bag-of-words (BOW), TFIDF). In\nthis paper, we propose to learn hash codes from BERT embeddings after observing\ntheir tremendous successes on downstream tasks. As a first try, we modify\nexisting generative hashing models to accommodate the BERT embeddings. However,\nlittle improvement is observed over the codes learned from the old BOW or TFIDF\nfeatures. We attribute this to the reconstruction requirement in the generative\nhashing, which will enforce irrelevant information that is abundant in the BERT\nembeddings also compressed into the codes. To remedy this issue, a new\nunsupervised hashing paradigm is further proposed based on the mutual\ninformation (MI) maximization principle. Specifically, the method first\nconstructs appropriate global and local codes from the documents and then seeks\nto maximize their mutual information. Experimental results on three benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate hash codes\nthat outperform existing ones learned from BOW features by a substantial\nmargin.",

Various methods have\nbeen proposed to address it via leveraging the advantages of graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs) or multi-task learning. However, most existing works do not\ntake the complex dependencies among different behaviors of users into\nconsideration. They utilize simple and fixed schemes, like neighborhood\ninformation aggregation or mathematical calculation of vectors, to fuse the\nembeddings of different user behaviors to obtain a unified embedding to\nrepresent a user's behavioral patterns which will be used in downstream\nrecommendation tasks. To tackle the challenge, in this paper, we first propose\nthe concept of hyper meta-path to construct hyper meta-paths or hyper\nmeta-graphs to explicitly illustrate the dependencies among different behaviors\nof a user. How to obtain a unified embedding for a user from hyper meta-paths\nand avoid the previously mentioned limitations simultaneously is critical.\nThanks to the recent success of graph contrastive learning, we leverage it to\nlearn embeddings of user behavior patterns adaptively instead of assigning a\nfixed scheme to understand the dependencies among different behaviors. A new\ngraph contrastive learning based framework is proposed by coupling with hyper\nmeta-paths, namely HMG-CR, which consistently and significantly outperforms all\nbaselines in extensive comparison experiments.",

To address this issue, we propose\nmethods to artificially create some of this metadata for synthetic tables.\nAfterward, we experiment with a BERT-based model, in line with recently\npublished works, that takes as input a combination of proposed artificial\nmetadata and table content. Our empirical results show that this leads to an\nimprovement of 9\\%-45\\% in F1 score, in absolute terms, over 2 tabular\ndatasets.",

          "description": "Conversational recommender systems have attracted immense attention recently.\nThe most recent approaches rely on neural models trained on recorded dialogs\nbetween humans, implementing an end-to-end learning process. These systems are\ncommonly designed to generate responses given the user's utterances in natural\nlanguage. One main challenge is that these generated responses both have to be\nappropriate for the given dialog context and must be grammatically and\nsemantically correct. An alternative to such generation-based approaches is to\nretrieve responses from pre-recorded dialog data and to adapt them if needed.\nSuch retrieval-based approaches were successfully explored in the context of\ngeneral conversational systems, but have received limited attention in recent\nyears for CRS. In this work, we re-assess the potential of such approaches and\ndesign and evaluate a novel technique for response retrieval and ranking. A\nuser study (N=90) revealed that the responses by our system were on average of\nhigher quality than those of two recent generation-based systems. We\nfurthermore found that the quality ranking of the two generation-based\napproaches is not aligned with the results from the literature, which points to\nopen methodological questions. Overall, our research underlines that\nretrieval-based approaches should be considered an alternative or complement to\nlanguage generation approaches.",

          "description": "Recommender systems research tends to evaluate model performance offline and\non randomly sampled targets, yet the same systems are later used to predict\nuser behavior sequentially from a fixed point in time. Simulating online\nrecommender system performance is notoriously difficult and the discrepancy\nbetween online and offline behaviors is typically not accounted for in offline\nevaluations. This disparity permits weaknesses to go unnoticed until the model\nis deployed in a production setting. In this paper, we first demonstrate how\nomitting temporal context when evaluating recommender system performance leads\nto false confidence. To overcome this, we postulate that offline evaluation\nprotocols can only model real-life use-cases if they account for temporal\ncontext. Next, we propose a training procedure to further embed the temporal\ncontext in existing models. We use a multi-objective approach to introduce\ntemporal context into traditionally time-unaware recommender systems and\nconfirm its advantage via the proposed evaluation protocol. Finally, we\nvalidate that the Pareto Fronts obtained with the added objective dominate\nthose produced by state-of-the-art models that are only optimized for accuracy\non three real-world publicly available datasets. The results show that\nincluding our temporal objective can improve recall@20 by up to 20%.",

This paper proposes Global-Local Item\nEmbedding (GLOIE) that learns to utilize the temporal properties of sets across\nwhole users as well as within a user by coining the names as global and local\ninformation to distinguish the two temporal patterns. GLOIE uses Variational\nAutoencoder (VAE) and dynamic graph-based model to capture global and local\ninformation and then applies attention to integrate resulting item embeddings.\nAdditionally, we propose to use Tweedie output for the decoder of VAE as it can\neasily model zero-inflated and long-tailed distribution, which is more suitable\nfor several real-world data distributions than Gaussian or multinomial\ncounterparts.

          "description": "We study the problem of query attribute value extraction, which aims to\nidentify named entities from user queries as diverse surface form attribute\nvalues and afterward transform them into formally canonical forms. Such a\nproblem consists of two phases: {named entity recognition (NER)} and {attribute\nvalue normalization (AVN)}. However, existing works only focus on the NER phase\nbut neglect equally important AVN. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a\nunified query attribute value extraction system in e-commerce search named\nQUEACO, which involves both two phases. Moreover, by leveraging large-scale\nweakly-labeled behavior data, we further improve the extraction performance\nwith less supervision cost. Specifically, for the NER phase, QUEACO adopts a\nnovel teacher-student network, where a teacher network that is trained on the\nstrongly-labeled data generates pseudo-labels to refine the weakly-labeled data\nfor training a student network. Meanwhile, the teacher network can be\ndynamically adapted by the feedback of the student's performance on\nstrongly-labeled data to maximally denoise the noisy supervisions from the weak\nlabels. For the AVN phase, we also leverage the weakly-labeled\nquery-to-attribute behavior data to normalize surface form attribute values\nfrom queries into canonical forms from products.

          "description": "Question Answering (QA), a popular and promising technique for intelligent\ninformation access, faces a dilemma about data as most other AI techniques. On\none hand, modern QA methods rely on deep learning models which are typically\ndata-hungry. Therefore, it is expected to collect and fuse all the available QA\ndatasets together in a common site for developing a powerful QA model. On the\nother hand, real-world QA datasets are typically distributed in the form of\nisolated islands belonging to different parties. Due to the increasing\nawareness of privacy security, it is almost impossible to integrate the data\nscattered around, or the cost is prohibited. A possible solution to this\ndilemma is a new approach known as federated learning, which is a\nprivacy-preserving machine learning technique over distributed datasets. In\nthis work, we propose to adopt federated learning for QA with the special\nconcern on the statistical heterogeneity of the QA data. Here the heterogeneity\nrefers to the fact that annotated QA data are typically with non-identical and\nindependent distribution (non-IID) and unbalanced sizes in practice.\nTraditional federated learning methods may sacrifice the accuracy of individual\nmodels under the heterogeneous situation. To tackle this problem, we propose a\nnovel Federated Matching framework for QA, named FedMatch, with a\nbackbone-patch architecture. The shared backbone is to distill the common\nknowledge of all the participants while the private patch is a compact and\nefficient module to retain the domain information for each participant. To\nfacilitate the evaluation, we build a benchmark collection based on several QA\ndatasets from different domains to simulate the heterogeneous situation in\npractice.

          "description": "How data is represented and operationalized is critical for building\ncomputational solutions that are both effective and efficient. A common\napproach is to represent data objects as binary vectors, denoted \\textit{hash\ncodes}, which require little storage and enable efficient similarity search\nthrough direct indexing into a hash table or through similarity computations in\nan appropriate space. Due to the limited expressibility of hash codes, compared\nto real-valued representations, a core open challenge is how to generate hash\ncodes that well capture semantic content or latent properties using a small\nnumber of bits, while ensuring that the hash codes are distributed in a way\nthat does not reduce their search efficiency. State of the art methods use\nrepresentation learning for generating such hash codes, focusing on neural\nautoencoder architectures where semantics are encoded into the hash codes by\nlearning to reconstruct the original inputs of the hash codes. This thesis\naddresses the above challenge and makes a number of contributions to\nrepresentation learning that (i) improve effectiveness of hash codes through\nmore expressive representations and a more effective similarity measure than\nthe current state of the art, namely the Hamming distance, and (ii) improve\nefficiency of hash codes by learning representations that are especially suited\nto the choice of search method. The contributions are empirically validated on\nseveral tasks related to similarity search and recommendation.",

          "description": "To alleviate data sparsity and cold-start problems of traditional recommender\nsystems (RSs), incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs) to supplement auxiliary\ninformation has attracted considerable attention recently. However, simply\nintegrating KGs in current KG-based RS models is not necessarily a guarantee to\nimprove the recommendation performance, which may even weaken the holistic\nmodel capability. This is because the construction of these KGs is independent\nof the collection of historical user-item interactions; hence, information in\nthese KGs may not always be helpful for recommendation to all users.\n\nIn this paper, we propose attentive Knowledge-aware Graph convolutional\nnetworks with Collaborative Guidance for personalized Recommendation (CG-KGR).\nCG-KGR is a novel knowledge-aware recommendation model that enables ample and\ncoherent learning of KGs and user-item interactions, via our proposed\nCollaborative Guidance Mechanism. Specifically, CG-KGR first encapsulates\nhistorical interactions to interactive information summarization. Then CG-KGR\nutilizes it as guidance to extract information out of KGs, which eventually\nprovides more precise personalized recommendation. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on four real-world datasets over two recommendation tasks, i.e.,\nTop-K recommendation and Click-Through rate (CTR) prediction. The experimental\nresults show that the CG-KGR model significantly outperforms recent\nstate-of-the-art models by 4.0-53.2% and 0.4-3.2%, in terms of Recall metric on\nTop-K recommendation and AUC on CTR prediction, respectively.",

          "description": "In this article, we propose a systematic approach for fire station location\nplanning. We develop a machine learning model, based on Random Forest, for\ndemand prediction and utilize the model further to define a generalized index\nto measure quality of fire service in urban settings. Our model is built upon\nspatial data collected from multiple different sources. Efficacy of proper\nfacility planning depends on choice of candidates where fire stations can be\nlocated along with existing stations, if any. Also, the travel time from these\ncandidates to demand locations need to be taken care of to maintain fire safety\nstandard. Here, we propose a travel time based clustering technique to identify\nsuitable candidates. Finally, we develop an optimization problem to select best\nlocations to install new fire stations. Our optimization problem is built upon\nmaximum coverage problem, based on integer programming. We present a detailed\nexperimental study of our proposed approach in collaboration with city of\nVictoria Fire Department, MN, USA. Our demand prediction model achieves true\npositive rate of 70% and false positive rate of 22% approximately. We aid\nVictoria Fire Department to select a location for a new fire station using our\napproach. We present detailed results on improvement statistics by locating a\nnew facility, as suggested by our methodology, in the city of Victoria.",
