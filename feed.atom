fracturing of society via decreased trust in democratic processes,
institutions, and science. The public has grown aware of the role of social
media as a superspreader of untrustworthy information, where even pandemics
have not been immune. In this paper, we focus on COVID-19 misinformation and
examine a subset of 2.1M tweets to understand misinformation as a function of
engagement, tweet content (COVID-19- vs. non-COVID-19-related), and veracity
(misleading or factual). Using correlation analysis, we show the most relevant
feature subsets among over 126 features that most heavily correlate with
misinformation or facts. We found that (i) factual tweets, regardless of
whether COVID-related, were more engaging than misinformation tweets; and (ii)
features that most heavily correlated with engagement varied depending on the
veracity and content of the tweet.]]></summary>

diagnosis will help the clinicians to provide accurate treatment for the
patients. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are widely used for epileptic
seizures detection, which provides specialists with substantial information
about the functioning of the brain. In this paper, a novel diagnostic procedure
using fuzzy theory and deep learning techniques are introduced. The proposed
method is evaluated on the Bonn University dataset with six classification
combinations and also on the Freiburg dataset. The tunable-Q wavelet transform
(TQWT) is employed to decompose the EEG signals into different sub-bands. In
the feature extraction step, 13 different fuzzy entropies are calculated from
different sub-bands of TQWT, and their computational complexities are
calculated to help researchers choose the best feature sets. In the following,
an autoencoder (AE) with six layers is employed for dimensionality reduction.
Finally, the standard adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and also
its variants with grasshopper optimization algorithm (ANFIS-GOA), particle
swarm optimization (ANFIS-PSO), and breeding swarm optimization (ANFIS-BS)
methods are used for classification. Using our proposed method, ANFIS-BS method
has obtained an accuracy of 99.74% in classifying into two classes and an
accuracy of 99.46% in ternary classification on the Bonn dataset and 99.28% on
the Freiburg dataset, reaching state-of-the-art performances on both of them.]]></summary>

single human label per example. Given imperfect labeling from annotators and
inherent ambiguity of language, we hypothesize that single label is not
sufficient to learn the spectrum of language interpretation. We explore new
label annotation distribution schemes, assigning multiple labels per example
for a small subset of training examples. Introducing such multi label examples
at the cost of annotating fewer examples brings clear gains on natural language
inference task and entity typing task, even when we simply first train with a
single label data and then fine tune with multi label examples. Extending a
MixUp data augmentation framework, we propose a learning algorithm that can
learn from uneven training examples (with zero, one, or multiple labels). This
algorithm efficiently combines signals from uneven training data and brings
additional gains in low annotation budget and cross domain settings. Together,
our method achieves consistent gains in both accuracy and label distribution
metrics in two tasks, suggesting training with uneven training data can be
beneficial for many NLP tasks.]]></summary>

activity in unprecedented detail. Latent variable models (LVMs) are promising
tools for analyzing this rich activity across diverse neural systems and

modeling is currently impeded by a lack of standardization, resulting in
methods being developed and compared in an ad hoc manner. To coordinate these
modeling efforts, we introduce a benchmark suite for latent variable modeling
of neural population activity. We curate four datasets of neural spiking
activity from cognitive, sensory, and motor areas to promote models that apply
to the wide variety of activity seen across these areas. We identify
unsupervised evaluation as a common framework for evaluating models across
datasets, and apply several baselines that demonstrate benchmark diversity. We

demonstrate significantly improved robustness for several state-of-the-art

show that our defense is still effective even if the attacker is aware of the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pretrained Masked Language Models (MLMs) have revolutionised NLP in recent
years. However, previous work has indicated that off-the-shelf MLMs are not
effective as universal lexical or sentence encoders without further
task-specific fine-tuning on NLI, sentence similarity, or paraphrasing tasks
using annotated task data. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to
turn MLMs into effective universal lexical and sentence encoders even without
any additional data and without any supervision. We propose an extremely
simple, fast and effective contrastive learning technique, termed Mirror-BERT,
which converts MLMs (e.g., BERT and RoBERTa) into such encoders in 20-30
seconds without any additional external knowledge. Mirror-BERT relies on fully
identical or slightly modified string pairs as positive (i.e., synonymous)
fine-tuning examples, and aims to maximise their similarity during identity
fine-tuning. We report huge gains over off-the-shelf MLMs with Mirror-BERT in
both lexical-level and sentence-level tasks, across different domains and
different languages. Notably, in the standard sentence semantic similarity
(STS) tasks, our self-supervised Mirror-BERT model even matches the performance
of the task-tuned Sentence-BERT models from prior work. Finally, we delve
deeper into the inner workings of MLMs, and suggest some evidence on why this
simple approach can yield effective universal lexical and sentence encoders.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We consider machine learning applications that train a model by leveraging
data distributed over a trusted network, where communication constraints can
create a performance bottleneck. A number of recent approaches propose to
overcome this bottleneck through compression of gradient updates. However, as
models become larger, so does the size of the gradient updates. In this paper,
we propose an alternate approach to learn from distributed data that quantizes
data instead of gradients, and can support learning over applications where the
size of gradient updates is prohibitive. Our approach leverages the dependency
of the computed gradient on data samples, which lie in a much smaller space in
order to perform the quantization in the smaller dimension data space. At the
cost of an extra gradient computation, the gradient estimate can be refined by
conveying the difference between the gradient at the quantized data point and
the original gradient using a small number of bits. Lastly, in order to save
communication, our approach adds a layer that decides whether to transmit a
quantized data sample or not based on its importance for learning. We analyze
the convergence of the proposed approach for smooth convex and non-convex
objective functions and show that we can achieve order optimal convergence
rates with communication that mostly depends on the data rather than the model
(gradient) dimension. We use our proposed algorithm to train ResNet models on
the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, and show that we can achieve an order of
magnitude savings over gradient compression methods. These communication
savings come at the cost of increasing computation at the learning agent, and
thus our approach is beneficial in scenarios where communication load is the
main problem.]]></summary>

ranking differently and simulate hypothesis-specific evidence rankings given
the evidence timestamps as gold standard. Evidence ranking in three
fact-checking models is ultimately optimized using a learning-to-rank loss

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most recent semantic segmentation methods adopt a U-Net framework with an
encoder-decoder architecture. It is still challenging for U-Net with a simple
skip connection scheme to model the global multi-scale context: 1) Not each
skip connection setting is effective due to the issue of incompatible feature
sets of encoder and decoder stage, even some skip connection negatively
influence the segmentation performance; 2) The original U-Net is worse than the
one without any skip connection on some datasets. Based on our findings, we
propose a new segmentation framework, named UCTransNet (with a proposed CTrans
module in U-Net), from the channel perspective with attention mechanism.
Specifically, the CTrans module is an alternate of the U-Net skip connections,
which consists of a sub-module to conduct the multi-scale Channel Cross fusion
with Transformer (named CCT) and a sub-module Channel-wise Cross-Attention
(named CCA) to guide the fused multi-scale channel-wise information to
effectively connect to the decoder features for eliminating the ambiguity.
Hence, the proposed connection consisting of the CCT and CCA is able to replace
the original skip connection to solve the semantic gaps for an accurate
automatic medical image segmentation. The experimental results suggest that our
UCTransNet produces more precise segmentation performance and achieves
consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art for semantic segmentation
across different datasets and conventional architectures involving transformer
or U-shaped framework. Code: https://github.com/McGregorWwww/UCTransNet.]]></summary>

workflow, such as medical image interpretation. However, the translation of
these black box algorithms into clinical practice has been marred by the
relative lack of transparency compared to conventional machine learning
methods, hindering in clinician trust in the systems for critical medical
decision-making. Specifically, common deep learning approaches do not have
intuitive ways of expressing uncertainty with respect to cases that might
require further human review. Furthermore, the possibility of algorithmic bias
has caused hesitancy regarding the use of developed algorithms in clinical
settings. To these ends, we explore how conformal methods can complement deep
learning models by providing both clinically intuitive way (by means of
confidence prediction sets) of expressing model uncertainty as well as
facilitating model transparency in clinical workflows. In this paper, we
conduct a field survey with clinicians to assess clinical use-cases of
conformal predictions. Next, we conduct experiments with a mammographic breast
density and dermatology photography datasets to demonstrate the utility of
conformal predictions in "rule-in" and "rule-out" disease scenarios. Further,
we show that conformal predictors can be used to equalize coverage with respect
to patient demographics such as race and skin tone. We find that a conformal

usability and transparency for better collaboration between deep learning

simple conceptually, for example $x_{n+1}=x_n-w_n$ where
$w_n=pr_{A_n,+}(v_n)-pr_{A_n,-}(v_n)$, with $A_n=\nabla ^2f(x_n)+\delta
_n||\nabla f(x_n)||^2.Id$ and $v_n=A_n^{-1}.\nabla f(x_n)$. Here $\delta _n$ is
an appropriate real number so that $A_n$ is invertible, and $pr_{A_n,\pm}$ are
projections to the vector subspaces generated by eigenvectors of positive
(correspondingly negative) eigenvalues of $A_n$.

The main result of this paper roughly says that if $f$ is $C^3$ (can be
unbounded from below) and a sequence $\{x_n\}$, constructed by the New
Q-Newton's method from a random initial point $x_0$, {\bf converges}, then the
limit point is a critical point and is not a saddle point, and the convergence
rate is the same as that of Newton's method. The first author has recently been
successful incorporating Backtracking line search to New Q-Newton's method,
thus resolving the convergence guarantee issue observed for some (non-smooth)
cost functions. An application to quickly finding zeros of a univariate
meromorphic function will be discussed. Various experiments are performed,
against well known algorithms such as BFGS and Adaptive Cubic Regularization
are presented.]]></summary>

procedures is a critical task for aligning preoperative data with
intraoperative geometry, ensuring effective surgical navigation and optimal
surgical precision. While the finite element method (FEM) is a proven technique
to effectively approximate soft tissue deformation through biomechanical
formulations, their degree of success boils down to a trade-off between
accuracy and speed. To circumvent this problem, the most recent works in this
domain have proposed leveraging data-driven models obtained by training various
machine learning algorithms, e.g. random forests, artificial neural networks
(ANNs), with the results of finite element analysis (FEA) to speed up tissue
deformation approximations by prediction. These methods, however, do not
account for the structure of the finite element (FE) mesh during training that
provides information on node connectivities as well as the distance between
them, which can aid with approximating tissue deformation based on the
proximity of force load points with the rest of the mesh nodes. Therefore, this
work proposes a novel framework, PhysGNN, a data-driven model that approximates
the solution of FEA by leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs), which are
capable of accounting for the mesh structural information and inductive
learning over unstructured grids and complex topological structures.
Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed architecture, PhysGNN, promises
accurate and fast soft tissue deformation approximations while remaining
computationally feasible, suitable for neurosurgical settings.]]></summary>

learning, algorithmic fairness, and domain adaptation/generalization among
others, involve learning \emph{invariant representations} of the data that aim
to achieve two competing goals: (a) maximize information or accuracy with
respect to a target response, and (b) maximize invariance or independence with
respect to a set of protected features (e.g.\ for fairness, privacy, etc).
Despite their wide applicability, theoretical understanding of the optimal
tradeoffs -- with respect to accuracy, and invariance -- achievable by
invariant representations is still severely lacking. In this paper, we provide
precisely such an information-theoretic analysis of such tradeoffs under both
classification and regression settings. We provide a geometric characterization
of the accuracy and invariance achievable by any representation of the data; we
term this feasible region the information plane. We provide a lower bound for
this feasible region for the classification case, and an exact characterization
for the regression case, which allows us to either bound or exactly
characterize the Pareto optimal frontier between accuracy and invariance.
Although our contributions are mainly theoretical, a key practical application
of our results is in certifying the potential sub-optimality of any given
representation learning algorithm for either classification or regression
tasks. Our results shed new light on the fundamental interplay between accuracy
and invariance, and may be useful in guiding the design of future
representation learning algorithms.]]></summary>

developing representation learning techniques that can incorporate known
physical constraints into the learned representation. As one example, in many
applications that involve a signal propagating through physical media (e.g.,
optics, acoustics, fluid dynamics, etc), it is known that the dynamics of the
signal must satisfy constraints imposed by the wave equation. Here we propose a
matrix factorization technique that decomposes such signals into a sum of
components, where each component is regularized to ensure that it satisfies
wave equation constraints. Although our proposed formulation is non-convex, we
prove that our model can be efficiently solved to global optimality in
polynomial time. We demonstrate the benefits of our work by applications in
structural health monitoring, where prior work has attempted to solve this
problem using sparse dictionary learning approaches that do not come with any
theoretical guarantees regarding convergence to global optimality and employ

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper proposes networked dynamics to solve resource allocation problems
over time-varying multi-agent networks. The state of each agent represents the
amount of used resources (or produced utilities) while the total amount of
resources is fixed. The idea is to optimally allocate the resources among the
group of agents by minimizing the overall cost function subject to fixed sum of
resources. Each agents' information is restricted to its own state and cost
function and those of its immediate in-neighbors. This is motivated by
distributed applications such as mobile edge-computing, economic dispatch over
smart grids, and multi-agent coverage control. This work provides a fast
convergent solution (in comparison with linear dynamics) while considering
relaxed network connectivity with quantized communication links. The proposed
dynamics reaches optimal solution over switching (possibly disconnected)
undirected networks as far as their union over some bounded non-overlapping
time-intervals has a spanning-tree. We prove feasibility of the solution,
uniqueness of the optimal state, and convergence to the optimal value under the
proposed dynamics, where the analysis is applicable to similar 1st-order
allocation dynamics with strongly sign-preserving nonlinearities, such as
actuator saturation.]]></summary>

accurate structures of proteins compared to other algorithmic approaches. It is
known that biologically small perturbations in the protein sequence do not lead
to drastic changes in the protein structure. In this paper, we demonstrate that
RoseTTAFold does not exhibit such a robustness despite its high accuracy, and
biologically small perturbations for some input sequences result in radically
different predicted protein structures. This raises the challenge of detecting
when these predicted protein structures cannot be trusted. We define the
robustness measure for the predicted structure of a protein sequence to be the
inverse of the root-mean-square distance (RMSD) in the predicted structure and
the structure of its adversarially perturbed sequence. We use adversarial
attack methods to create adversarial protein sequences, and show that the RMSD
in the predicted protein structure ranges from 0.119\r{A} to 34.162\r{A} when
the adversarial perturbations are bounded by 20 units in the BLOSUM62 distance.
This demonstrates very high variance in the robustness measure of the predicted
structures. We show that the magnitude of the correlation (0.917) between our
robustness measure and the RMSD between the predicted structure and the ground
truth is high, that is, the predictions with low robustness measure cannot be
trusted. This is the first paper demonstrating the susceptibility of
RoseTTAFold to adversarial attacks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, many non-traditional classification methods, such as Random
Forest, Boosting, and neural network, have been widely used in applications.
Their performance is typically measured in terms of classification accuracy.
While the classification error rate and the like are important, they do not
address a fundamental question: Is the classification method underfitted? To
our best knowledge, there is no existing method that can assess the
goodness-of-fit of a general classification procedure. Indeed, the lack of a
parametric assumption makes it challenging to construct proper tests. To
overcome this difficulty, we propose a methodology called BAGofT that splits
the data into a training set and a validation set. First, the classification
procedure to assess is applied to the training set, which is also used to
adaptively find a data grouping that reveals the most severe regions of
underfitting. Then, based on this grouping, we calculate a test statistic by
comparing the estimated success probabilities and the actual observed responses
from the validation set. The data splitting guarantees that the size of the
test is controlled under the null hypothesis, and the power of the test goes to
one as the sample size increases under the alternative hypothesis. For testing
parametric classification models, the BAGofT has a broader scope than the
existing methods since it is not restricted to specific parametric models
(e.g., logistic regression). Extensive simulation studies show the utility of
the BAGofT when assessing general classification procedures and its strengths
over some existing methods when testing parametric classification models.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The factual knowledge acquired during pre-training and stored in the
parameters of Language Models (LMs) can be useful in downstream tasks (e.g.,
question answering or textual inference). However, some facts can be
incorrectly induced or become obsolete over time. We present KnowledgeEditor, a
method which can be used to edit this knowledge and, thus, fix 'bugs' or
unexpected predictions without the need for expensive re-training or
fine-tuning. Besides being computationally efficient, KnowledgeEditordoes not
require any modifications in LM pre-training (e.g., the use of meta-learning).
In our approach, we train a hyper-network with constrained optimization to
modify a fact without affecting the rest of the knowledge; the trained
hyper-network is then used to predict the weight update at test time. We show
KnowledgeEditor's efficacy with two popular architectures and
knowledge-intensive tasks: i) a BERT model fine-tuned for fact-checking, and
ii) a sequence-to-sequence BART model for question answering. With our method,
changing a prediction on the specific wording of a query tends to result in a
consistent change in predictions also for its paraphrases. We show that this
can be further encouraged by exploiting (e.g., automatically-generated)
paraphrases during training. Interestingly, our hyper-network can be regarded
as a 'probe' revealing which components need to be changed to manipulate
factual knowledge; our analysis shows that the updates tend to be concentrated
on a small subset of components. Source code available at

increased population densities and environmental awareness. Large quantities of
data are currently generated, allowing for more robust methods to understand

datasets suffer from data integrity problems; boarding stop information may be
missing due to imperfect acquirement processes or inadequate reporting. We
developed a supervised machine learning method to impute missing boarding stops
based on ordinal classification using GTFS timetable, smart card, and
geospatial datasets. A new metric, Pareto Accuracy, is suggested to evaluate
algorithms where classes have an ordinal nature. Results are based on a case
study in the city of Beer Sheva, Israel, consisting of one month of smart card
data. We show that our proposed method is robust to irregular travelers and
significantly outperforms well-known imputation methods without the need to
mine any additional datasets. Validation of data from another Israeli city
using transfer learning shows the presented model is general and context-free.

analytically tractable optimization program, in a quest to better understand
deep neural networks that are trained for a sufficiently long time. As the name
suggests, this new model is derived by isolating the topmost layer from the
remainder of the neural network, followed by imposing certain constraints
separately on the two parts of the network. We demonstrate that the
Layer-Peeled Model, albeit simple, inherits many characteristics of
well-trained neural networks, thereby offering an effective tool for explaining
and predicting common empirical patterns of deep learning training. First, when
working on class-balanced datasets, we prove that any solution to this model
forms a simplex equiangular tight frame, which in part explains the recently
discovered phenomenon of neural collapse \cite{papyan2020prevalence}. More
importantly, when moving to the imbalanced case, our analysis of the
Layer-Peeled Model reveals a hitherto unknown phenomenon that we term
\textit{Minority Collapse}, which fundamentally limits the performance of deep
learning models on the minority classes. In addition, we use the Layer-Peeled
Model to gain insights into how to mitigate Minority Collapse. Interestingly,
this phenomenon is first predicted by the Layer-Peeled Model before being
confirmed by our computational experiments.]]></summary>

data are no longer required in deep learning-based image denoising. However,
existing blind denoising methods still require the assumption with regard to
noise characteristics, such as zero-mean noise distribution and pixel-wise
noise-signal independence; this hinders wide adaptation of the method in the
medical domain. On the other hand, unpaired learning can overcome limitations
related to the assumption on noise characteristics, which makes it more
feasible for collecting the training data in real-world scenarios. In this
paper, we propose a novel image denoising scheme, Interdependent
Self-Cooperative Learning (ISCL), that leverages unpaired learning by combining
cyclic adversarial learning with self-supervised residual learning. Unlike the
existing unpaired image denoising methods relying on matching data
distributions in different domains, the two architectures in ISCL, designed for
different tasks, complement each other and boost the learning process. To
assess the performance of the proposed method, we conducted extensive
experiments in various biomedical image degradation scenarios, such as noise
caused by physical characteristics of electron microscopy (EM) devices (film
and charging noise), and structural noise found in low-dose computer tomography
(CT). We demonstrate that the image quality of our method is superior to
conventional and current state-of-the-art deep learning-based image denoising

approach, which is usually inefficient. To address this problem, we propose an
automated security assessment framework for IoT networks. Our framework first
leverages machine learning and natural language processing to analyze
vulnerability descriptions for predicting vulnerability metrics. The predicted
metrics are then input into a two-layered graphical security model, which
consists of an attack graph at the upper layer to present the network
connectivity and an attack tree for each node in the network at the bottom
layer to depict the vulnerability information. This security model
automatically assesses the security of the IoT network by capturing potential
attack paths. We evaluate the viability of our approach using a
proof-of-concept smart building system model which contains a variety of
real-world IoT devices and potential vulnerabilities. Our evaluation of the
proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness in terms of automatically
predicting the vulnerability metrics of new vulnerabilities with more than 90%
accuracy, on average, and identifying the most vulnerable attack paths within
an IoT network. The produced assessment results can serve as a guideline for
cybersecurity professionals to take further actions and mitigate risks in a
timely manner.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a ride-hailing system, an optimal relocation of vacant vehicles can
significantly reduce fleet idling time and balance the supply-demand
distribution, enhancing system efficiency and promoting driver satisfaction and
retention. Model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been shown to
dynamically learn the relocating policy by actively interacting with the
intrinsic dynamics in large-scale ride-hailing systems. However, the issues of
sparse reward signals and unbalanced demand and supply distribution place
critical barriers in developing effective DRL models. Conventional exploration
strategy (e.g., the $\epsilon$-greedy) may barely work under such an
environment because of dithering in low-demand regions distant from
high-revenue regions. This study proposes the deep relocating option policy
(DROP) that supervises vehicle agents to escape from oversupply areas and
effectively relocate to potentially underserved areas. We propose to learn the
Laplacian embedding of a time-expanded relocation graph, as an approximation
representation of the system relocation policy. The embedding generates
task-agnostic signals, which in combination with task-dependent signals,
constitute the pseudo-reward function for generating DROPs. We present a
hierarchical learning framework that trains a high-level relocation policy and
a set of low-level DROPs. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated
using a custom-built high-fidelity simulator with real-world trip record data.
We report that DROP significantly improves baseline models with 15.7% more
hourly revenue and can effectively resolve the dithering issue in low-demand
areas.]]></summary>

independent of each other, but rather can have compositional relationships with
other clusters (e.g., an image set consists of rectangles, circles, as well as
combinations of rectangles and circles). This task is motivated by recent work
in few-shot learning on compositional embedding models that structure the
embedding space to distinguish the label sets, not just the individual labels,
assigned to the examples. To tackle this clustering problem, we propose a new
algorithm called Compositional Affinity Propagation (CAP). In contrast to
standard Affinity Propagation as well as other algorithms for multi-view and
hierarchical clustering, CAP can deduce compositionality among clusters
automatically. We show promising results, compared to several existing

to this problem by proving sharp lower bounds on the approximation rates for
shallow neural networks, which are obtained by lower bounding the $L^2$-metric
entropy of the convex hull of the neural network basis functions. In addition,
our methods also give sharp lower bounds on the Kolmogorov $n$-widths of this
convex hull, which show that the variation spaces corresponding to shallow
neural networks cannot be efficiently approximated by linear methods. These
lower bounds apply to both sigmoidal activation functions with bounded
variation and to activation functions which are a power of the ReLU. Our
results also quantify how much stronger the Barron spectral norm is than the
variation norm and, combined with previous results, give the asymptotics of the

complexity, the MONEY index takes into account the various singular vectors of
the matrix reconstructed by MC, whereas other indices are based only on one/two
eigenvectors of a suitable symmetric matrix, derived from the RCA matrix.
Finally, MC is compared with a state-of-the-art economic complexity index

staggering pace, with thousands of papers released every month. A large portion
of chemistry literature focuses on new molecules and reactions between
molecules. Most vital information is conveyed through 2-D images of molecules,
representing the underlying molecules or reactions described. In order to
ensure reproducible and machine-readable molecule representations, text-based
molecule descriptors like SMILES and SELFIES were created. These text-based
molecule representations provide molecule generation but are unfortunately
rarely present in published literature. In the absence of molecule descriptors,
the generation of molecule descriptors from the 2-D images present in the
literature is necessary to understand chemistry literature at scale. Successful
methods such as Optical Structure Recognition Application (OSRA), and
ChemSchematicResolver are able to extract the locations of molecules structures
in chemistry papers and infer molecular descriptions and reactions. While
effective, existing systems expect chemists to correct outputs, making them
unsuitable for unsupervised large-scale data mining. Leveraging the task
formulation of image captioning introduced by DECIMER, we introduce IMG2SMI, a
model which leverages Deep Residual Networks for image feature extraction and
an encoder-decoder Transformer layers for molecule description generation.
Unlike previous Neural Network-based systems, IMG2SMI builds around the task of
molecule description generation, which enables IMG2SMI to outperform OSRA-based
systems by 163% in molecule similarity prediction as measured by the molecular
MACCS Fingerprint Tanimoto Similarity. Additionally, to facilitate further
research on this task, we release a new molecule prediction dataset. including

steadily improving during recent years. However, these methods are not directly
applicable in preclinical context due to limited datasets and lower image
resolution. Successful application of deep architectures for rat cardiac
segmentation, although of critical importance for preclinical evaluation of
cardiac function, has to our knowledge not yet been reported. We developed
segmentation models that expand on the standard U-Net architecture and
evaluated separate models for systole and diastole phases, 2MSA, and one model
for all timepoints, 1MSA. Furthermore, we calibrated model outputs using a
Gaussian Process (GP)-based prior to improve phase selection. Resulting models
approach human performance in terms of left ventricular segmentation quality
and ejection fraction (EF) estimation in both 1MSA and 2MSA settings
(S{\o}rensen-Dice score 0.91 +/- 0.072 and 0.93 +/- 0.032, respectively). 2MSA
achieved a mean absolute difference between estimated and reference EF of 3.5
+/- 2.5 %, while 1MSA resulted in 4.1 +/- 3.0 %. Applying Gaussian Processes to
1MSA allows to automate the selection of systole and diastole phases. Combined
with a novel cardiac phase selection strategy, our work presents an important

networks, have been developed recently to improve programming productivity and
perform program analysis. To reliably use such tools, developers often need to
reason about the behavior of the underlying models and the factors that affect
them. This is especially challenging for tools backed by deep neural networks.
Various methods have tried to reduce this opacity in the vein of
"transparent/interpretable-AI". However, these approaches are often specific to
a particular set of network architectures, even requiring access to the
network's parameters. This makes them difficult to use for the average
programmer, which hinders the reliable adoption of neural CI systems. In this
paper, we propose a simple, model-agnostic approach to identify critical input
features for models in CI systems, by drawing on software debugging research,
specifically delta debugging. Our approach, SIVAND, uses simplification
techniques that reduce the size of input programs of a CI model while
preserving the predictions of the model. We show that this approach yields
remarkably small outputs and is broadly applicable across many model
architectures and problem domains. We find that the models in our experiments
often rely heavily on just a few syntactic features in input programs. We
believe that SIVAND's extracted features may help understand neural CI systems'
predictions and learned behavior.]]></summary>

extended to consider dynamic risk measures. However, all current
implementations either employ a static risk measure that violates time
consistency, or are based on traditional dynamic programming solution schemes
that are impracticable in problems with a large number of underlying assets
(due to the curse of dimensionality) or with incomplete asset dynamics
information. In this paper, we extend for the first time a famous off-policy
deterministic actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (ACRL) algorithm to the
problem of solving a risk averse Markov decision process that models risk using
a time consistent recursive expectile risk measure. This new ACRL algorithm
allows us to identify high quality time consistent hedging policies (and equal
risk prices) for options, such as basket options, that cannot be handled using
traditional methods, or in context where only historical trajectories of the
underlying assets are available. Our numerical experiments, which involve both
a simple vanilla option and a more exotic basket option, confirm that the new
ACRL algorithm can produce 1) in simple environments, nearly optimal hedging
policies, and highly accurate prices, simultaneously for a range of maturities
2) in complex environments, good quality policies and prices using reasonable
amount of computing resources; and 3) overall, hedging strategies that actually
outperform the strategies produced using static risk measures when the risk is
evaluated at later points of time.]]></summary>

we propose an end-to-end unsupervised system design for obtaining polygon

embeddings for the address texts using a deep learning-based architecture, viz.
RoBERTa, trained on our internal address dataset. The PoI candidates are
identified by jointly clustering the anonymised customer phone GPS locations
(obtained during address onboarding) and the embeddings of the address texts.
The final list of PoI polygons is obtained from these PoI candidates using
novel post-processing steps. This algorithm identified 74.8 % more PoIs than

that captures linear, nonlinear, lagged and instantaneous relations among
variables while ensuring acyclicity throughout the entire graph. The proposed
method extends nonparametric NOTEARS, a recent continuous optimization approach
for learning nonparametric instantaneous DAGs. The proposed method is faster
than constraint-based methods using nonlinear conditional independence tests.
We also promote the use of optimization constraints to incorporate prior
knowledge into the structure learning process. A broad set of experiments with
simulated data demonstrates that the proposed method discovers better DAG
structures than several recent comparison methods. We also evaluate the
proposed method on complex real-world data acquired from NHL ice hockey games
containing a mixture of continuous and discrete variables. The code is

deep networks on devices with limited resources, like smart wearables,
cellphones, drones, and autonomous vehicles. Low bit quantization such as
binary and ternary quantization is a common approach to alleviate this resource
requirements. Ternary quantization provides a more flexible model and
outperforms binary quantization in terms of accuracy, however doubles the
memory footprint and increases the computational cost. Contrary to these
approaches, mixed quantized models allow a trade-off between accuracy and
memory footprint. In such models, quantization depth is often chosen manually,
or is tuned using a separate optimization routine. The latter requires training
a quantized network multiple times. Here, we propose an adaptive combination of
binary and ternary quantization, namely Smart Quantization (SQ), in which the
quantization depth is modified directly via a regularization function, so that
the model is trained only once. Our experimental results show that the proposed

performance in many graph-based applications. Despite the high expressive
power, they typically need to perform an expensive recursive neighborhood
expansion in multiple training epochs and face a scalability issue. Moreover,
most of them are inflexible since they are restricted to fixed-hop
neighborhoods and insensitive to actual receptive field demands for different
nodes. We circumvent these limitations by introducing a scalable and flexible
Graph Attention Multilayer Perceptron (GAMLP). With the separation of the
non-linear transformation and feature propagation, GAMLP significantly improves
the scalability and efficiency by performing the propagation procedure in a
pre-compute manner. With three principled receptive field attention, each node
in GAMLP is flexible and adaptive in leveraging the propagated features over
the different sizes of reception field. We conduct extensive evaluations on the
three large open graph benchmarks (e.g., ogbn-papers100M, ogbn-products and
ogbn-mag), demonstrating that GAMLP not only achieves the state-of-art
performance, but also additionally provide high scalability and efficiency.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Partial orders and directed acyclic graphs are commonly recurring data
structures that arise naturally in numerous domains and applications and are
used to represent ordered relations between entities in the domains. Examples
are task dependencies in a project plan, transaction order in distributed
ledgers and execution sequences of tasks in computer programs, just to mention
a few. We study the problem of order preserving hierarchical clustering of this
kind of ordered data. That is, if we have $a < b$ in the original data and
denote their respective clusters by $[a]$ and $[b]$, then we shall have $[a] <
[b]$ in the produced clustering. The clustering is similarity based and uses
standard linkage functions, such as single- and complete linkage, and is an
extension of classical hierarchical clustering.

To achieve this, we define the output from running classical hierarchical
clustering on strictly ordered data to be partial dendrograms; sub-trees of
classical dendrograms with several connected components. We then construct an
embedding of partial dendrograms over a set into the family of ultrametrics
over the same set. An optimal hierarchical clustering is defined as the partial
dendrogram corresponding to the ultrametric closest to the original
dissimilarity measure, measured in the p-norm. Thus, the method is a
combination of classical hierarchical clustering and ultrametric fitting.

A reference implementation is employed for experiments on both synthetic
random data and real world data from a database of machine parts. When compared
to existing methods, the experiments show that our method excels both in
cluster quality and order preservation.]]></summary>

components, anomalies do not only affect their origin but propagate through the
distributed system. Taking this into account, we present Arvalus and its

components as nodes and their dependencies and placement as edges to improve
the identification and localization of anomalies. Given a series of metric
KPIs, our method predicts the most likely system state - either normal or an
anomaly class - and performs localization when an anomaly is detected. During
our experiments, we simulate a distributed cloud application deployment and
synthetically inject anomalies. The evaluation shows the generally good

efficient retrieval of large-scale multi-modal data has become a trendy
research topic. Thereinto, hashing has become a prevalent choice due to its
retrieval efficiency and low storage cost. Although multi-modal hashing has
drawn lots of attention in recent years, there still remain some problems. The
first point is that existing methods are mainly designed in batch mode and not
able to efficiently handle streaming multi-modal data. The second point is that
all existing online multi-modal hashing methods fail to effectively handle
unseen new classes which come continuously with streaming data chunks. In this
paper, we propose a new model, termed Online enhAnced SemantIc haShing (OASIS).
We design novel semantic-enhanced representation for data, which could help
handle the new coming classes, and thereby construct the enhanced semantic
objective function. An efficient and effective discrete online optimization
algorithm is further proposed for OASIS. Extensive experiments show that our
method can exceed the state-of-the-art models. For good reproducibility and
benefiting the community, our code and data are already available in

significant progress has been made in analyzing object grasping from vision, it
remains unclear how we can utilize tactile sensing to reason about and model
the dynamics of hand-object interactions. In this work, we employ a
high-resolution tactile glove to perform four different interactive activities
on a diversified set of objects. We build our model on a cross-modal learning
framework and generate the labels using a visual processing pipeline to
supervise the tactile model, which can then be used on its own during the test
time. The tactile model aims to predict the 3d locations of both the hand and
the object purely from the touch data by combining a predictive model and a
contrastive learning module. This framework can reason about the interaction
patterns from the tactile data, hallucinate the changes in the environment,
estimate the uncertainty of the prediction, and generalize to unseen objects.
We also provide detailed ablation studies regarding different system designs as
well as visualizations of the predicted trajectories. This work takes a step on
dynamics modeling in hand-object interactions from dense tactile sensing, which
opens the door for future applications in activity learning, human-computer
interactions, and imitation learning for robotics.]]></summary>

feed. One key problem is to allocate the limited slots in the feed to maximize
the overall revenue as well as improve user experience, which requires a good
model for user preference. Instead of modeling the influence of individual
items on user behaviors, the arrangement signal models the influence of the
arrangement of items and may lead to a better allocation strategy. However,
most of previous strategies fail to model such a signal and therefore result in
suboptimal performance. To this end, we propose Cross Deep Q Network (Cross
DQN) to extract the arrangement signal by crossing the embeddings of different
items and processing the crossed sequence in the feed. Our model results in
higher revenue and better user experience than state-of-the-art baselines in
offline experiments. Moreover, our model demonstrates a significant improvement
in the online A/B test and has been fully deployed on Meituan feed to serve

impairments, and how to extract and utilize the effective features from motor
imagery electroencephalogram(EEG) channels has always been the focus of
attention. There are many different methods for the motor imagery
classification, but the limited understanding on human brain requires more
effective methods for extracting the features of EEG data. Graph neural
networks(GNNs) have demonstrated its effectiveness in classifying graph
structures; and the use of GNN provides new possibilities for brain structure
connection feature extraction. In this paper we propose a novel graph neural
network based on the mutual information of the raw EEG channels called
MutualGraphNet. We use the mutual information as the adjacency matrix combined
with the spatial temporal graph convolution network(ST-GCN) could extract the
transition rules of the motor imagery electroencephalogram(EEG) channels data
more effectively. Experiments are conducted on motor imagery EEG data set and
we compare our model with the current state-of-the-art approaches and the
results suggest that MutualGraphNet is robust enough to learn the interpretable
features and outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

engineering can be tedious. However, prior IRL algorithms use on-policy
transitions, which require intensive sampling from the current policy for
stable and optimal performance. This limits IRL applications in the real world,
where environment interactions can become highly expensive. To tackle this
problem, we present Off-Policy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (OPIRL), which
(1) adopts off-policy data distribution instead of on-policy and enables
significant reduction of the number of interactions with the environment, (2)
learns a stationary reward function that is transferable with high
generalization capabilities on changing dynamics, and (3) leverages
mode-covering behavior for faster convergence. We demonstrate that our method
is considerably more sample efficient and generalizes to novel environments
through the experiments. Our method achieves better or comparable results on
policy performance baselines with significantly fewer interactions.
Furthermore, we empirically show that the recovered reward function generalizes
to different tasks where prior arts are prone to fail.]]></summary>

into small patches. Then we extract the unit component vectors and eigenvalues
of these patches with principal component analysis (PCA). Base on the
eigenvalues, we can model the energy distribution of adversarial perturbations.
We then perform black-box attacks by sampling from the perturbation patches
according to their energy distribution, and tiling the sampled patches to form
a full-size adversarial perturbation. This can be done without the available
access to victim models. Extensive experiments well demonstrate that the
proposed Energy Attack achieves state-of-the-art performance in black-box

decision problems under uncertainty. To derive a robust optimization model, a
central ingredient is to identify a suitable model for uncertainty, which is
called the uncertainty set. An ongoing challenge in the recent literature is to
derive uncertainty sets from given historical data that result in solutions
that are robust regarding future scenarios. In this paper we use an
unsupervised deep learning method to learn and extract hidden structures from
data, leading to non-convex uncertainty sets and better robust solutions. We
prove that most of the classical uncertainty classes are special cases of our
derived sets and that optimizing over them is strongly NP-hard. Nevertheless,
we show that the trained neural networks can be integrated into a robust
optimization model by formulating the adversarial problem as a convex quadratic
mixed-integer program. This allows us to derive robust solutions through an
iterative scenario generation process. In our computational experiments, we
compare this approach to a similar approach using kernel-based support vector
clustering. We find that uncertainty sets derived by the unsupervised deep
learning method find a better description of data and lead to robust solutions
that outperform the comparison method both with respect to objective value and
feasibility.]]></summary>

task (VTR) has become a new trend, which exceeds previous VTR methods. Though,
due to the heterogeneity of structures and contents between video and text,
previous CLIP-based models are prone to overfitting in the training phase,
resulting in relatively poor retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a
multi-stream Corpus Alignment network with single gate Mixture-of-Experts
(CAMoE) and a novel Dual Softmax Loss (DSL) to solve the two heterogeneity. The
CAMoE employs Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to extract multi-perspective video
representations, including action, entity, scene, etc., then align them with
the corresponding part of the text. In this stage, we conduct massive
explorations towards the feature extraction module and feature alignment
module. DSL is proposed to avoid the one-way optimum-match which occurs in
previous contrastive methods. Introducing the intrinsic prior of each pair in a
batch, DSL serves as a reviser to correct the similarity matrix and achieves
the dual optimal match. DSL is easy to implement with only one-line code but
improves significantly. The results show that the proposed CAMoE and DSL are of
strong efficiency, and each of them is capable of achieving State-of-The-Art
(SOTA) individually on various benchmarks such as MSR-VTT, MSVD, and LSMDC.
Further, with both of them, the performance is advanced to a big extend,
surpassing the previous SOTA methods for around 4.6\% R@1 in MSR-VTT.]]></summary>

represent and process language. Standard representational similarity measures
such as cosine similarity and Euclidean distance have been successfully used in
static word embedding models to understand how words cluster in semantic space.
Recently, these measures have been applied to embeddings from contextualized
models such as BERT and GPT-2. In this work, we call into question the
informativity of such measures for contextualized language models. We find that
a small number of rogue dimensions, often just 1-3, dominate these measures.
Moreover, we find a striking mismatch between the dimensions that dominate
similarity measures and those which are important to the behavior of the model.
We show that simple postprocessing techniques such as standardization are able
to correct for rogue dimensions and reveal underlying representational quality.
We argue that accounting for rogue dimensions is essential for any

allows clients to collaboratively train a model over their own local data. FL
promises the privacy of clients and its security can be strengthened by
cryptographic methods such as additively homomorphic encryption (HE). However,
the efficiency of FL could seriously suffer from the statistical heterogeneity
in both the data distribution discrepancy among clients and the global
distribution skewness. We mathematically demonstrate the cause of performance
degradation in FL and examine the performance of FL over various datasets. To
tackle the statistical heterogeneity problem, we propose a pluggable
system-level client selection method named Dubhe, which allows clients to
proactively participate in training, meanwhile preserving their privacy with
the assistance of HE. Experimental results show that Dubhe is comparable with
the optimal greedy method on the classification accuracy, with negligible
encryption and communication overhead.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph comparison deals with identifying similarities and dissimilarities
between graphs. A major obstacle is the unknown alignment of graphs, as well as
the lack of accurate and inexpensive comparison metrics. In this work we
introduce the filter graph distance. It is an optimal transport based distance
which drives graph comparison through the probability distribution of filtered
graph signals. This creates a highly flexible distance, capable of prioritising
different spectral information in observed graphs, offering a wide range of
choices for a comparison metric. We tackle the problem of graph alignment by
computing graph permutations that minimise our new filter distances, which
implicitly solves the graph comparison problem. We then propose a new
approximate cost function that circumvents many computational difficulties
inherent to graph comparison and permits the exploitation of fast algorithms
such as mirror gradient descent, without grossly sacrificing the performance.
We finally propose a novel algorithm derived from a stochastic version of
mirror gradient descent, which accommodates the non-convexity of the alignment
problem, offering a good trade-off between performance accuracy and speed. The
experiments on graph alignment and classification show that the flexibility
gained through filter graph distances can have a significant impact on
performance, while the difference in speed offered by the approximation cost
makes the framework applicable in practical settings.]]></summary>

method that has been widely used in data analysis and modeling. It is an
unsupervised learning technique that identifies a suitable linear subspace for
the input variable that contains maximal variation and preserves as much
information as possible. PCA has also been used in prediction models where the
original, high-dimensional space of predictors is reduced to a smaller, more
manageable, set before conducting regression analysis. However, this approach
does not incorporate information in the response during the dimension-reduction
stage and hence can have poor predictive performance. To address this concern,
several supervised linear dimension-reduction techniques have been proposed in
the literature. This paper reviews selected techniques, extends some of them,
and compares their performance through simulations. Two of these techniques,
partial least squares (PLS) and least-squares PCA (LSPCA), consistently
outperform the others in this study.]]></summary>

by approaches to noise tolerance from classical learning theory, we introduce
the Statistical Query (SQ) model for PAC-learning quantum states, and prove
that algorithms in this model are indeed resilient to common forms of noise,
including classification and depolarizing noise. We prove an exponential lower
bound on learning stabilizer states in the SQ model. Even outside the SQ model,
we prove that learning stabilizer states with noise is in general as hard as
Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) using classical examples. Our results position
the problem of learning stabilizer states as a natural quantum analogue of the
classical problem of learning parities: easy in the noiseless setting, but

compulsory advances in air surveillance. While it supports the tracking of the
ever-growing number of aircraft in the air, it also introduces cybersecurity
issues that must be mitigated e.g., false data injection attacks where an
attacker emits fake surveillance information. The recent data sources and tools
available to obtain flight tracking records allow the researchers to create
datasets and develop Machine Learning models capable of detecting such
anomalies in En-Route trajectories. In this context, we propose a novel
multivariate anomaly detection model called Discriminatory Auto-Encoder (DAE).
It uses the baseline of a regular LSTM-based auto-encoder but with several
decoders, each getting data of a specific flight phase (e.g. climbing, cruising
or descending) during its training.To illustrate the DAE's efficiency, an
evaluation dataset was created using real-life anomalies as well as
realistically crafted ones, with which the DAE as well as three anomaly
detection models from the literature were evaluated. Results show that the DAE
achieves better results in both accuracy and speed of detection. The dataset,
the models implementations and the evaluation results are available in an

processing (NLP) research. Many existing state-of-the-art models are first
pre-trained on a large text corpus and then fine-tuned on downstream tasks.
However, due to limited data resources from downstream tasks and the extremely
large capacity of pre-trained models, aggressive fine-tuning often causes the
adapted model to overfit the data of downstream tasks and forget the knowledge
of the pre-trained model. To address the above issue in a more principled
manner, we propose a new computational framework for robust and efficient
fine-tuning for pre-trained language models. Specifically, our proposed
framework contains two important ingredients: 1. Smoothness-inducing
regularization, which effectively manages the capacity of the model; 2. Bregman
proximal point optimization, which is a class of trust-region methods and can
prevent knowledge forgetting. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multiple NLP benchmarks.]]></summary>

analysis and statistical modeling. It allows to obtain knowledge about the
structure of the dataset, ie. whether data points have been generated by a
probability distribution with a single or more than one peaks. Such knowledge
is very useful for several data analysis problems, such as for deciding on the
number of clusters and determining unimodal projections. We propose a technique
called UU-test (Unimodal Uniform test) to decide on the unimodality of a
one-dimensional dataset. The method operates on the empirical cumulative
density function (ecdf) of the dataset. It attempts to build a piecewise linear
approximation of the ecdf that is unimodal and models the data sufficiently in
the sense that the data corresponding to each linear segment follows the
uniform distribution. A unique feature of this approach is that in the case of
unimodality, it also provides a statistical model of the data in the form of a
Uniform Mixture Model. We present experimental results in order to assess the
ability of the method to decide on unimodality and perform comparisons with the
well-known dip-test approach. In addition, in the case of unimodal datasets we
evaluate the Uniform Mixture Models provided by the proposed method using the
test set log-likelihood and the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test.]]></summary>

optimization problems. When the loss function is a sum of multiple terms, a
popular method is the stochastic gradient descent. Viewed as a process for
sampling the loss function landscape, the stochastic gradient descent is known
to prefer flat minima. Though this is desired for certain optimization problems
such as in deep learning, it causes issues when the goal is to find the global
minimum, especially if the global minimum resides in a sharp valley.

Illustrated with a simple motivating example, we show that the fundamental
reason is that the difference in the Lipschitz constants of multiple terms in
the loss function causes stochastic gradient descent to experience different
variances at different minima. In order to mitigate this effect and perform
faithful optimization, we propose a combined resampling-reweighting scheme to
balance the variance at local minima and extend to general loss functions. We
explain from the numerical stability perspective how the proposed scheme is
more likely to select the true global minimum, and the local convergence
analysis perspective how it converges to a minimum faster when compared with
the vanilla stochastic gradient descent. Experiments from robust statistics and
computational chemistry are provided to demonstrate the theoretical findings.]]></summary>

important direction of research. Crafting image-dependent adversarial
perturbations using white-box feedback has hitherto been the norm for such
adversarial attacks. However, black-box attacks are much more practical for
real-world applications. Universal perturbations applicable across multiple
images are gaining popularity due to their innate generalizability. There have
also been efforts to restrict the perturbations to a few pixels in the image.
This helps to retain visual similarity with the original images making such
attacks hard to detect. This paper marks an important step which combines all
these directions of research. We propose the DEceit algorithm for constructing
effective universal pixel-restricted perturbations using only black-box
feedback from the target network. We conduct empirical investigations using the
ImageNet validation set on the state-of-the-art deep neural classifiers by
varying the number of pixels to be perturbed from a meagre 10 pixels to as high
as all pixels in the image. We find that perturbing only about 10% of the
pixels in an image using DEceit achieves a commendable and highly transferable
Fooling Rate while retaining the visual quality. We further demonstrate that
DEceit can be successfully applied to image dependent attacks as well. In both

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Electroencephalogram (EEG) has shown a useful approach to produce a
brain-computer interface (BCI). One-dimensional (1-D) EEG signal is yet easily
disturbed by certain artifacts (a.k.a. noise) due to the high temporal
resolution. Thus, it is crucial to remove the noise in received EEG signal.
Recently, deep learning-based EEG signal denoising approaches have achieved
impressive performance compared with traditional ones. It is well known that
the characteristics of self-similarity (including non-local and local ones) of
data (e.g., natural images and time-domain signals) are widely leveraged for
denoising. However, existing deep learning-based EEG signal denoising methods
ignore either the non-local self-similarity (e.g., 1-D convolutional neural
network) or local one (e.g., fully connected network and recurrent neural
network). To address this issue, we propose a novel 1-D EEG signal denoising
network with 2-D transformer, namely EEGDnet. Specifically, we comprehensively
take into account the non-local and local self-similarity of EEG signal through
the transformer module. By fusing non-local self-similarity in self-attention
blocks and local self-similarity in feed forward blocks, the negative impact
caused by noises and outliers can be reduced significantly. Extensive
experiments show that, compared with other state-of-the-art models, EEGDnet
achieves much better performance in terms of both quantitative and qualitative
metrics.]]></summary>

of research studies and scientific papers have been found difficult or
impossible to reproduce, we face a challenge which is called reproducibility
crisis. Although the demand for reproducibility in Machine Learning (ML) is
acknowledged in the literature, a main barrier is inherent non-determinism in
ML training and inference. In this paper, we establish the fundamental factors
that cause non-determinism in ML systems. A framework, ReproduceML, is then
introduced for deterministic evaluation of ML experiments in a real, controlled
environment. ReproduceML allows researchers to investigate software
configuration effects on ML training and inference. Using ReproduceML, we run a
case study: investigation of the impact of bugs inside ML libraries on
performance of ML experiments. This study attempts to quantify the impact that
the occurrence of bugs in a popular ML framework, PyTorch, has on the
performance of trained models. To do so, a comprehensive methodology is
proposed to collect buggy versions of ML libraries and run deterministic ML
experiments using ReproduceML. Our initial finding is that there is no evidence
based on our limited dataset to show that bugs which occurred in PyTorch do
affect the performance of trained models. The proposed methodology as well as
ReproduceML can be employed for further research on non-determinism and bugs.]]></summary>

optimal operation of reservoirs. Real-time operation of the reservoir based on
forecasts of inflows can lead to substantial economic gains. However, the
forecast of inflow is an intricate task as it has to incorporate the impacts of
climate and hydrological changes. Therefore, the major objective of the present
work is to develop a novel approach based on long short-term memory (LSTM) for
the forecast of inflows. Real-time inflow forecast, in other words, daily
inflow at the reservoir helps in efficient operation of water resources. Also,
daily variations in the release can be monitored efficiently and the
reliability of operation is improved. This work proposes a naive anomaly
detection algorithm baseline based on LSTM. In other words, a strong baseline
to forecast flood and drought for any deep learning-based prediction model. The
practicality of the approach has been demonstrated using the observed daily
data of the past 20 years from Bhakra Dam in India. The results of the
simulations conducted herein clearly indicate the supremacy of the LSTM
approach over the traditional methods of forecasting. Although, experiments are
run on data from Bhakra Dam Reservoir in India, LSTM model, and anomaly
detection algorithm are general purpose and can be applied to any basin with
minimal changes. A distinct practical advantage of the LSTM method presented
herein is that it can adequately simulate non-stationarity and non-linearity in
the historical data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We formulate a practical yet challenging problem: General Partial Label
Learning (GPLL). Compared to the traditional Partial Label Learning (PLL)
problem, GPLL relaxes the supervision assumption from instance-level -- a label
set partially labels an instance -- to group-level: 1) a label set partially
labels a group of instances, where the within-group instance-label link
annotations are missing, and 2) cross-group links are allowed -- instances in a
group may be partially linked to the label set from another group. Such
ambiguous group-level supervision is more practical in real-world scenarios as
additional annotation on the instance-level is no longer required, e.g.,
face-naming in videos where the group consists of faces in a frame, labeled by
a name set in the corresponding caption. In this paper, we propose a novel
graph convolutional network (GCN) called Dual Bipartite Graph Autoencoder
(DB-GAE) to tackle the label ambiguity challenge of GPLL. First, we exploit the
cross-group correlations to represent the instance groups as dual bipartite
graphs: within-group and cross-group, which reciprocally complements each other
to resolve the linking ambiguities. Second, we design a GCN autoencoder to
encode and decode them, where the decodings are considered as the refined
results. It is worth noting that DB-GAE is self-supervised and transductive, as
it only uses the group-level supervision without a separate offline training
stage. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DB-GAE
significantly outperforms the best baseline over absolute 0.159 F1-score and
24.8% accuracy. We further offer analysis on various levels of label
ambiguities.]]></summary>

industrial machine learning applications, needs labor-intensive feature
engineering and data analyzing for giving precise model predictions. An
automatic machine learning framework is needed to ease the manual efforts in
fine-tuning the models so that the experts can focus more on other problems
that really need humans' engagement such as problem definition, deployment, and
business services. However, there are three main challenges for building
automatic solutions for temporal relational data: 1) how to effectively and
automatically mining useful information from the multiple tables and the
relations from them? 2) how to be self-adjustable to control the time and
memory consumption within a certain budget? and 3) how to give generic
solutions to a wide range of tasks? In this work, we propose our solution that
successfully addresses the above issues in an end-to-end automatic way. The
proposed framework, AutoSmart, is the winning solution to the KDD Cup 2019 of
the AutoML Track, which is one of the largest AutoML competition to date (860
teams with around 4,955 submissions). The framework includes automatic data
processing, table merging, feature engineering, and model tuning, with a
time\&memory controller for efficiently and automatically formulating the
models. The proposed framework outperforms the baseline solution significantly
on several datasets in various domains.]]></summary>

these textual reports as a form of weak supervision to improve the image
interpretation performance of a neural network without requiring additional
manually labeled examples. We use an image-text matching task to train a
feature extractor and then fine-tune it in a transfer learning setting for a
supervised task using a small labeled dataset. The end result is a neural
network that automatically interprets imagery without requiring textual reports
during inference. This approach can be applied to any task for which text-image
pairs are readily available. We evaluate our method on three classification

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, the textual adversarial attack models become increasingly popular
due to their successful in estimating the robustness of NLP models. However,
existing works have obvious deficiencies. (1) They usually consider only a
single granularity of modification strategies (e.g. word-level or
sentence-level), which is insufficient to explore the holistic textual space
for generation; (2) They need to query victim models hundreds of times to make
a successful attack, which is highly inefficient in practice. To address such
problems, in this paper we propose MAYA, a Multi-grAnularitY Attack model to
effectively generate high-quality adversarial samples with fewer queries to
victim models. Furthermore, we propose a reinforcement-learning based method to
train a multi-granularity attack agent through behavior cloning with the expert
knowledge from our MAYA algorithm to further reduce the query times.
Additionally, we also adapt the agent to attack black-box models that only
output labels without confidence scores. We conduct comprehensive experiments
to evaluate our attack models by attacking BiLSTM, BERT and RoBERTa in two
different black-box attack settings and three benchmark datasets. Experimental
results show that our models achieve overall better attacking performance and
produce more fluent and grammatical adversarial samples compared to baseline
models. Besides, our adversarial attack agent significantly reduces the query
times in both attack settings. Our codes are released at

adapting them onto a specific NLP task still requires a considerably large
amount of labeled data. Effective task fine-tuning meets challenges when only a
few labeled examples are present for the task. In this paper, we aim to the
address of the problem of few shot task learning by exploiting and transferring
from a different task which admits a related but disparate label space.
Specifically, we devise a label transfer network (LTN) to transform the labels
from source task to the target task of interest for training. Both the LTN and
the model for task prediction are learned via a bi-level optimization
framework, which we term as MetaXT. MetaXT offers a principled solution to best
adapt a pre-trained language model to the target task by transferring knowledge
from the source task. Empirical evaluations on cross-task transfer settings for
four NLP tasks, from two different types of label space disparities,
demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaXT, especially when the labeled data in

privacy-preserving manner gives rise to a novel machine learning paradigm
called federated learning (FL). Given a sufficient level of privacy guarantees,
the practicality of an FL system mainly depends on its time-to-accuracy
performance during the training process. Despite bearing some resemblance with
traditional distributed training, FL has four distinct challenges that
complicate the optimization towards shorter time-to-accuracy: information
deficiency, coupling for contrasting factors, client heterogeneity, and huge
configuration space. Motivated by the need for inspiring related research, in
this paper we survey highly relevant attempts in the FL literature and organize
them by the related training phases in the standard workflow: selection,
configuration, and reporting. We also review exploratory work including
measurement studies and benchmarking tools to friendly support FL developers.
Although a few survey articles on FL already exist, our work differs from them
in terms of the focus, classification, and implications.]]></summary>

outperformed classical machine learning models. Previously, neural network
designs, such as Multitask Learning, have accounted for variations in emotional
expressions due to demographic and contextual factors. However, existing models
face a few constraints: 1) they rely on a clear definition of domains (e.g.
gender, noise condition, etc.) and the availability of domain labels; 2) they
often attempt to learn domain-invariant features while emotion expressions can
be domain-specific. In the present study, we propose the Nonparametric
Hierarchical Neural Network (NHNN), a lightweight hierarchical neural network
model based on Bayesian nonparametric clustering. In comparison to Multitask
Learning approaches, the proposed model does not require domain/task labels. In
our experiments, the NHNN models generally outperform the models with similar
levels of complexity and state-of-the-art models in within-corpus and
cross-corpus tests. Through clustering analysis, we show that the NHNN models
are able to learn group-specific features and bridge the performance gap
between groups.]]></summary>

global model for prediction based on a number of local models at clients while
local data privacy is preserved. Class imbalance is believed to be one of the
factors that degrades the global model performance. However, there has been
very little research on if and how class imbalance can affect the global
performance. class imbalance in federated learning is much more complex than
that in traditional non-distributed machine learning, due to different class
imbalance situations at local clients. Class imbalance needs to be re-defined
in distributed learning environments. In this paper, first, we propose two new
metrics to define class imbalance -- the global class imbalance degree (MID)
and the local difference of class imbalance among clients (WCS). Then, we
conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impact of class imbalance on the
global performance in various scenarios based on our definition. Our results
show that a higher MID and a larger WCS degrade more the performance of the
global model. Besides, WCS is shown to slow down the convergence of the global
model by misdirecting the optimization.]]></summary>

in extracting semantic information from episodic memories. However, the
characteristic creative nature of dreams suggests that memory semantization may
go beyond merely replaying previous experiences. We propose that
rapid-eye-movement (REM) dreaming is essential for efficient memory
semantization by randomly combining episodic memories to create new, virtual
sensory experiences. We support this hypothesis by implementing a cortical
architecture with hierarchically organized feedforward and feedback pathways,
inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs). Learning in our model is
organized across three different global brain states mimicking wakefulness,
non-REM (NREM) and REM sleep, optimizing different, but complementary objective
functions. We train the model in an unsupervised fashion on standard datasets
of natural images and evaluate the quality of the learned representations. Our
results suggest that adversarial dreaming during REM sleep is essential for
extracting memory contents, while perturbed dreaming during NREM sleep improves
robustness of the latent representation to noisy sensory inputs. The model
provides a new computational perspective on sleep states, memory replay and
dreams and suggests a cortical implementation of GANs.]]></summary>

deaths and injuries occurring worldwide. Distracted or anomalous driving
behaviours are deviations from the 'normal' driving that need to be identified
correctly to alert the driver. However, these driving behaviours do not
comprise of one specific type of driving style and their distribution can be
different during training and testing phases of a classifier. We formulate this
problem as a supervised contrastive learning approach to learn a visual
representation to detect normal, and seen and unseen anomalous driving
behaviours. We made a change to the standard contrastive loss function to
adjust the similarity of negative pairs to aid the optimization. Normally, the
(self) supervised contrastive framework contains an encoder followed by a
projection head, which is omitted during testing phase as the encoding layers
are considered to contain general visual representative information. However,
we assert that for supervised contrastive learning task, including projection
head will be beneficial. We showed our results on a Driver Anomaly Detection
dataset that contains 783 minutes of video recordings of normal and anomalous
driving behaviours of 31 drivers from various from top and front cameras (both
depth and infrared). We also performed an extra step of fine tuning the labels
in this dataset. Out of 9 video modalities combinations, our modified
contrastive approach improved the ROC AUC on 7 in comparison to the baseline
models (from 3.12% to 8.91% for different modalities); the remaining two models
also had manual labelling. We performed statistical tests that showed evidence
that our modifications perform better than the baseline contrastive models.
Finally, the results showed that the fusion of depth and infrared modalities

techniques often involves model updates and deployment. It is unbearable to
re-embedding and re-index with the system suspended when deploying new models.
Therefore, backward-compatible representation is proposed to enable "new"
features to be compared with "old" features directly, which means that the
database is active when there are both "new" and "old" features in it. Thus we
can scroll-refresh the database or even do nothing on the database to update.

The existing backward-compatible methods either require a strong overlap
between old and new training data or simply conduct constraints at the instance
level. Thus they are difficult in handling complicated cluster structures and
are limited in eliminating the impact of outliers in old embeddings, resulting
in a risk of damaging the discriminative capability of new features. In this
work, we propose a Neighborhood Consensus Contrastive Learning (NCCL) method.
With no assumptions about the new training data, we estimate the sub-cluster
structures of old embeddings. A new embedding is constrained with multiple old
embeddings in both embedding space and discrimination space at the sub-class
level. The effect of outliers diminished, as the multiple samples serve as
"mean teachers". Besides, we also propose a scheme to filter the old embeddings
with low credibility, further improving the compatibility robustness. Our
method ensures backward compatibility without impairing the accuracy of the new
model. And it can even improve the new model's accuracy in most scenarios.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The remarkable success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in various applications
is accompanied by a significant increase in network parameters and arithmetic
operations. Such increases in memory and computational demands make deep
learning prohibitive for resource-constrained hardware platforms such as mobile
devices. Recent efforts aim to reduce these overheads, while preserving model
performance as much as possible, and include parameter reduction techniques,
parameter quantization, and lossless compression techniques.

In this chapter, we develop and describe a novel quantization paradigm for
DNNs: Our method leverages concepts of explainable AI (XAI) and concepts of
information theory: Instead of assigning weight values based on their distances
to the quantization clusters, the assignment function additionally considers
weight relevances obtained from Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and the
information content of the clusters (entropy optimization). The ultimate goal
is to preserve the most relevant weights in quantization clusters of highest
information content.

Experimental results show that this novel Entropy-Constrained and
XAI-adjusted Quantization (ECQ$^{\text{x}}$) method generates ultra
low-precision (2-5 bit) and simultaneously sparse neural networks while
maintaining or even improving model performance. Due to reduced parameter
precision and high number of zero-elements, the rendered networks are highly
compressible in terms of file size, up to $103\times$ compared to the
full-precision unquantized DNN model. Our approach was evaluated on different
types of models and datasets (including Google Speech Commands and CIFAR-10)
and compared with previous work.]]></summary>

reinforcement learning, a major challenge to widespread industrial adoption of
deep reinforcement learning that has recently surfaced but little explored is
the potential vulnerability to privacy breaches. In particular, there have been
no concrete adversarial attack strategies in literature tailored for studying
the vulnerability of deep reinforcement learning algorithms to membership
inference attacks. To address this gap, we propose an adversarial attack
framework tailored for testing the vulnerability of deep reinforcement learning
algorithms to membership inference attacks. More specifically, we design a
series of experiments to investigate the impact of temporal correlation, which
naturally exists in reinforcement learning training data, on the probability of
information leakage. Furthermore, we study the differences in the performance
of \emph{collective} and \emph{individual} membership attacks against deep
reinforcement learning algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed
adversarial attack framework is surprisingly effective at inferring the data
used during deep reinforcement training with an accuracy exceeding $84\%$ in
individual and $97\%$ in collective mode on two different control tasks in
OpenAI Gym, which raises serious privacy concerns in the deployment of models
resulting from deep reinforcement learning. Moreover, we show that the learning

very challenging learning stiff dynamics. In this paper, we develop DAE-PINN,

solution trajectories of nonlinear differential-algebraic equations (DAE),
which present a form of infinite stiffness and describe, for example, the
dynamics of power networks. Our DAE-PINN bases its effectiveness on the synergy
between implicit Runge-Kutta time-stepping schemes (designed specifically for
solving DAEs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINN) (deep neural networks
that we train to satisfy the dynamics of the underlying problem). Furthermore,
our framework (i) enforces the neural network to satisfy the DAEs as
(approximate) hard constraints using a penalty-based method and (ii) enables
simulating DAEs for long-time horizons. We showcase the effectiveness and
accuracy of DAE-PINN by learning and simulating the solution trajectories of a

We show how proving the existence of invariant functions, i.e., constant of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most existing NER methods rely on extensive labeled data for model training,
which struggles in the low-resource scenarios with limited training data.
Recently, prompt-tuning methods for pre-trained language models have achieved
remarkable performance in few-shot learning by exploiting prompts as task
guidance to reduce the gap between training progress and downstream tuning.
Inspired by prompt learning, we propose a novel lightweight generative
framework with prompt-guided attention for low-resource NER (LightNER).
Specifically, we construct the semantic-aware answer space of entity categories
for prompt learning to generate the entity span sequence and entity categories
without any label-specific classifiers. We further propose prompt-guided
attention by incorporating continuous prompts into the self-attention layer to
re-modulate the attention and adapt pre-trained weights. Note that we only tune
those continuous prompts with the whole parameter of the pre-trained language
model fixed, thus, making our approach lightweight and flexible for
low-resource scenarios and can better transfer knowledge across domains.
Experimental results show that LightNER can obtain comparable performance in
the standard supervised setting and outperform strong baselines in low-resource
settings by tuning only a small part of the parameters.]]></summary>

our model to selectively attend to relevant regions in the input while ignoring
information irrelevant to the driving task, effectively associating the images
with the BEV representation. In a new evaluation setting involving adverse
environmental conditions and challenging scenarios, NEAT outperforms several
strong baselines and achieves driving scores on par with the privileged CARLA

logged data, but with a very restricted interaction budget. Solving this
problem would enable safe evaluation and deployment of offline reinforcement
learning policies in industry, robotics, and recommendation domains among
others. Several off-policy evaluation (OPE) techniques have been proposed to
assess the value of policies using only logged data. However, there is still a
big gap between the evaluation by OPE and the full online evaluation in the
real environment. At the same time, large amount of online interactions is
often not feasible in practice. To overcome this problem, we introduce
\emph{active offline policy selection} -- a novel sequential decision approach
that combines logged data with online interaction to identify the best policy.
This approach uses OPE estimates to warm start the online evaluation. Then, in
order to utilize the limited environment interactions wisely, it relies on a
Bayesian optimization method, with a kernel function that represents policy
similarity, to decide which policy to evaluate next. We use multiple benchmarks
with a large number of candidate policies to show that the proposed approach

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vehicle Re-identification (ReID) is an important yet challenging problem in
computer vision. Compared to other visual objects like faces and persons,
vehicles simultaneously exhibit much larger intraclass viewpoint variations and
interclass visual similarities, making most exiting loss functions designed for
face recognition and person ReID unsuitable for vehicle ReID. To obtain a
high-performance vehicle ReID model, we present a novel Distance Shrinking with
Angular Marginalizing (DSAM) loss function to perform hybrid learning in both
the Original Feature Space (OFS) and the Feature Angular Space (FAS) using the
local verification and the global identification information. Specifically, it
shrinks the distance between samples of the same class locally in the Original
Feature Space while keeps samples of different classes far away in the Feature
Angular Space. The shrinking and marginalizing operations are performed during
each iteration of the training process and are suitable for different SoftMax
based loss functions. We evaluate the DSAM loss function on three large vehicle
ReID datasets with detailed analyses and extensive comparisons with many
competing vehicle ReID methods. Experimental results show that our DSAM loss
enhances the SoftMax loss by a large margin on the PKU-VD1-Large dataset:
10.41% for mAP, 5.29% for cmc1, and 4.60% for cmc5. Moreover, the mAP is
increased by 9.34% on the PKU-VehicleID dataset and 6.13% on the VeRi-776
dataset. Source code will be released to facilitate further studies in this
research direction.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nowadays, scene text recognition has attracted more and more attention due to
its various applications. Most state-of-the-art methods adopt an
encoder-decoder framework with attention mechanism, which generates text
autoregressively from left to right. Despite the convincing performance, the
speed is limited because of the one-by-one decoding strategy. As opposed to
autoregressive models, non-autoregressive models predict the results in
parallel with a much shorter inference time, but the accuracy falls behind the
autoregressive counterpart considerably. In this paper, we propose a Parallel,
Iterative and Mimicking Network (PIMNet) to balance accuracy and efficiency.
Specifically, PIMNet adopts a parallel attention mechanism to predict the text
faster and an iterative generation mechanism to make the predictions more
accurate. In each iteration, the context information is fully explored. To
improve learning of the hidden layer, we exploit the mimicking learning in the
training phase, where an additional autoregressive decoder is adopted and the
parallel decoder mimics the autoregressive decoder with fitting outputs of the
hidden layer. With the shared backbone between the two decoders, the proposed
PIMNet can be trained end-to-end without pre-training. During inference, the
branch of the autoregressive decoder is removed for a faster speed. Extensive
experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
of PIMNet. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Pay20Y/PIMNet.]]></summary>

workflow, such as medical image interpretation. However, the translation of
these black box algorithms into clinical practice has been marred by the
relative lack of transparency compared to conventional machine learning
methods, hindering in clinician trust in the systems for critical medical
decision-making. Specifically, common deep learning approaches do not have
intuitive ways of expressing uncertainty with respect to cases that might
require further human review. Furthermore, the possibility of algorithmic bias
has caused hesitancy regarding the use of developed algorithms in clinical
settings. To these ends, we explore how conformal methods can complement deep
learning models by providing both clinically intuitive way (by means of
confidence prediction sets) of expressing model uncertainty as well as
facilitating model transparency in clinical workflows. In this paper, we
conduct a field survey with clinicians to assess clinical use-cases of
conformal predictions. Next, we conduct experiments with a mammographic breast
density and dermatology photography datasets to demonstrate the utility of
conformal predictions in "rule-in" and "rule-out" disease scenarios. Further,
we show that conformal predictors can be used to equalize coverage with respect
to patient demographics such as race and skin tone. We find that a conformal

weakly-supervised and few-shot learning techniques. In this work, we collect a
large dataset of summaries paired with user reviews for over 31,000 products,
enabling supervised training. However, the number of reviews per product is
large (320 on average), making summarization - and especially training a
summarizer - impractical. Moreover, the content of many reviews is not
reflected in the human-written summaries, and, thus, the summarizer trained on
random review subsets hallucinates. In order to deal with both of these
challenges, we formulate the task as jointly learning to select informative
subsets of reviews and summarizing the opinions expressed in these subsets. The
choice of the review subset is treated as a latent variable, predicted by a
small and simple selector. The subset is then fed into a more powerful
summarizer. For joint training, we use amortized variational inference and
policy gradient methods. Our experiments demonstrate the importance of
selecting informative reviews resulting in improved quality of summaries and
reduced hallucinations.]]></summary>

data-efficient learning of new tasks. However, several important issues in
meta-learning have proven hard to study thus far. For example, performance
degrades in real-world settings where meta-learners must learn from a wide and
potentially multi-modal distribution of training tasks; and when distribution
shift exists between meta-train and meta-test task distributions. These issues
are typically hard to study since the shape of task distributions, and shift
between them are not straightforward to measure or control in standard
benchmarks. We propose the channel coding problem as a benchmark for
meta-learning. Channel coding is an important practical application where task
distributions naturally arise, and fast adaptation to new tasks is practically
valuable. We use our MetaCC benchmark to study several aspects of
meta-learning, including the impact of task distribution breadth and shift,
which can be controlled in the coding problem. Going forward, MetaCC provides a
tool for the community to study the capabilities and limitations of
meta-learning, and to drive research on practically robust and effective
meta-learners.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning the similarity between images constitutes the foundation for
numerous vision tasks. The common paradigm is discriminative metric learning,
which seeks an embedding that separates different training classes. However,
the main challenge is to learn a metric that not only generalizes from training
to novel, but related, test samples. It should also transfer to different
object classes. So what complementary information is missed by the
discriminative paradigm? Besides finding characteristics that separate between
classes, we also need them to likely occur in novel categories, which is
indicated if they are shared across training classes. This work investigates
how to learn such characteristics without the need for extra annotations or
training data. By formulating our approach as a novel triplet sampling
strategy, it can be easily applied on top of recent ranking loss frameworks.
Experiments show that, independent of the underlying network architecture and
the specific ranking loss, our approach significantly improves performance in
deep metric learning, leading to new the state-of-the-art results on various
standard benchmark datasets. Preliminary early access page can be found here:

classification tasks. The core idea of prompt-tuning is to insert text pieces
(i.e., templates) into the input and transform a classification task into a
masked language modeling problem. However, for relation extraction, determining
an appropriate prompt template requires domain expertise, and it is cumbersome
and time-consuming to obtain a suitable label word. Furthermore, there exist
abundant semantic knowledge among the entities and relations that cannot be
ignored. To this end, we focus on incorporating knowledge into prompt-tuning
for relation extraction and propose a knowledge-aware prompt-tuning approach
with synergistic optimization (KnowPrompt). Specifically, we inject entity and
relation knowledge into prompt construction with learnable virtual template
words as well as answer words and synergistically optimize their representation
with knowledge constraints. Extensive experimental results on five datasets
with standard and low-resource settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach.]]></summary>

analysis and scene understanding. Most existing segmentation methods focus on
the case where the images are taken from directly overhead (i.e., low
off-nadir/viewing angle). These methods often fail to provide accurate results
on satellite images with larger off-nadir angles due to the higher noise level
and lower spatial resolution. In this paper, we propose a method that is able
to provide accurate building segmentation for satellite imagery captured from a
large range of off-nadir angles. Based on Bayesian deep learning, we explicitly
design our method to learn the data noise via aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainty modeling. Satellite image metadata (e.g., off-nadir angle and
ground sample distance) is also used in our model to further improve the
result. We show that with uncertainty modeling and metadata injection, our
method achieves better performance than the baseline method, especially for
noisy images taken from large off-nadir angles.]]></summary>

architectures allowing the fusion of these modalities. However, such systems
are mainly trained by minimising simple losses such as $L_1$ or cross-entropy.
In this work, we investigate unexplored penalties and propose a set of new
objectives that measure the dependency between modalities. We demonstrate that
our new penalties lead to a consistent improvement (up to $4.3$ on accuracy)
across a large variety of state-of-the-art models on two well-known sentiment
analysis datasets: \texttt{CMU-MOSI} and \texttt{CMU-MOSEI}. Our method not
only achieves a new SOTA on both datasets but also produces representations
that are more robust to modality drops. Finally, a by-product of our methods
includes a statistical network which can be used to interpret the high
dimensional representations learnt by the model.]]></summary>

establish and ensure that the total operation cost of multi-energy systems
remains at a minimum while fulfilling all system constraints. However, this
method presumes an adequate model of the underlying system dynamics, which is
prone to modelling errors and is not necessarily adaptive. This has an
associated initial and ongoing project-specific engineering cost. In this
paper, we present an on- and off-policy multi-objective reinforcement learning
(RL) approach, that does not assume a model a priori, benchmarking this against
a linear MPC (LMPC - to reflect current practice, though non-linear MPC
performs better) - both derived from the general optimal control problem,
highlighting their differences and similarities. In a simple multi-energy
system (MES) configuration case study, we show that a twin delayed deep
deterministic policy gradient (TD3) RL agent offers potential to match and
outperform the perfect foresight LMPC benchmark (101.5%). This while the
realistic LMPC, i.e. imperfect predictions, only achieves 98%. While in a more
complex MES system configuration, the RL agent's performance is generally lower
(94.6%), yet still better than the realistic LMPC (88.9%). In both case
studies, the RL agents outperformed the realistic LMPC after a training period
of 2 years using quarterly interactions with the environment. We conclude that
reinforcement learning is a viable optimal control technique for multi-energy
systems given adequate constraint handling and pre-training, to avoid unsafe
interactions and long training periods, as is proposed in fundamental future
work.]]></summary>

when applied in real-world scenarios involving strong domain shifts. We address
the challenging domain generalization (DG) problem, where a model trained on a

any exposure to their data. The main challenge of DG is that the features
learned from the source domains are not necessarily present in the unseen

richer set of features is crucial to improve the transfer to a wider set of

new feature discovery via a targeted corruption of the most relevant input and

explosion issue of using GPT in variational learning and speeds up training.

locations in Bird's Eye View (BEV) scene coordinates to waypoints and
semantics, using intermediate attention maps to iteratively compress
high-dimensional 2D image features into a compact representation. This allows
our model to selectively attend to relevant regions in the input while ignoring
information irrelevant to the driving task, effectively associating the images
with the BEV representation. In a new evaluation setting involving adverse
environmental conditions and challenging scenarios, NEAT outperforms several
strong baselines and achieves driving scores on par with the privileged CARLA

provides novel alternatives for efficiently recognizing complex patterns and

different systems. Thus, the study of physics-guided DL emerged and has gained
great progress. Physics-guided DL aims to take the best from both physics-based
modeling and state-of-the-art DL models to better solve scientific problems. In
this paper, we provide a structured overview of existing methodologies of

attacks, while the existing black-box attacks require extensive queries on the
victim DNN to achieve high success rates. For query-efficiency, surrogate
models of the victim are adopted as transferable attackers in consideration of
their Gradient Similarity (GS), i.e., surrogates' attack gradients are similar
to the victim's ones to some extent. However, it is generally neglected to
exploit their similarity on outputs, namely the Prediction Similarity (PS), to
filter out inefficient queries. To jointly utilize and also optimize
surrogates' GS and PS, we develop QueryNet, an efficient attack network that
can significantly reduce queries. QueryNet crafts several transferable
Adversarial Examples (AEs) by surrogates, and then decides also by surrogates
on the most promising AE, which is then sent to query the victim. That is to
say, in QueryNet, surrogates are not only exploited as transferable attackers,
but also as transferability evaluators for AEs. The AEs are generated using
surrogates' GS and evaluated based on their PS, and therefore, the query
results could be back-propagated to optimize surrogates' parameters and also
their architectures, enhancing both the GS and the PS. QueryNet has significant
query-efficiency, i.e., reduces queries by averagely about an order of
magnitude compared to recent SOTA methods according to our comprehensive and
real-world experiments: 11 victims (including 2 commercial models) on
MNIST/CIFAR10/ImageNet, allowing only 8-bit image queries, and no access to the

analytically tractable optimization program, in a quest to better understand
deep neural networks that are trained for a sufficiently long time. As the name
suggests, this new model is derived by isolating the topmost layer from the
remainder of the neural network, followed by imposing certain constraints
separately on the two parts of the network. We demonstrate that the
Layer-Peeled Model, albeit simple, inherits many characteristics of
well-trained neural networks, thereby offering an effective tool for explaining
and predicting common empirical patterns of deep learning training. First, when
working on class-balanced datasets, we prove that any solution to this model
forms a simplex equiangular tight frame, which in part explains the recently
discovered phenomenon of neural collapse \cite{papyan2020prevalence}. More
importantly, when moving to the imbalanced case, our analysis of the
Layer-Peeled Model reveals a hitherto unknown phenomenon that we term
\textit{Minority Collapse}, which fundamentally limits the performance of deep
learning models on the minority classes. In addition, we use the Layer-Peeled
Model to gain insights into how to mitigate Minority Collapse. Interestingly,
this phenomenon is first predicted by the Layer-Peeled Model before being

represent and process language. Standard representational similarity measures
such as cosine similarity and Euclidean distance have been successfully used in
static word embedding models to understand how words cluster in semantic space.
Recently, these measures have been applied to embeddings from contextualized
models such as BERT and GPT-2. In this work, we call into question the
informativity of such measures for contextualized language models. We find that
a small number of rogue dimensions, often just 1-3, dominate these measures.
Moreover, we find a striking mismatch between the dimensions that dominate
similarity measures and those which are important to the behavior of the model.
We show that simple postprocessing techniques such as standardization are able
to correct for rogue dimensions and reveal underlying representational quality.
We argue that accounting for rogue dimensions is essential for any

imperative duty in modern software development as log files are necessary for
tracking down runtime system issues and troubleshooting system management
tasks. Prior research has emphasized the importance of logging statements in
the operation and debugging of software systems. However, the current logging
process is mostly manual and ad hoc, and thus, proper placement and content of
logging statements remain as challenges. To overcome these challenges, methods
that aim to automate log placement and log content, i.e., 'where, what, and how
to log', are of high interest. Thus, we propose to accomplish the goal of this
research, that is "to predict the log statements by utilizing source code
clones and natural language processing (NLP)", as these approaches provide
additional context and advantage for log prediction. We pursue the following
four research objectives: (RO1) investigate whether source code clones can be
leveraged for log statement location prediction, (RO2) propose a clone-based
approach for log statement prediction, (RO3) predict log statement's
description with code-clone and NLP models, and (RO4) examine approaches to
automatically predict additional details of the log statement, such as its
verbosity level and variables. For this purpose, we perform an experimental
analysis on seven open-source java projects, extract their method-level code
clones, investigate their attributes, and utilize them for log location and
description prediction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of log-aware
clone detection for automated log location and description prediction and
outperforms the prior work.]]></summary>

training data in high-resource source languages are available, where the task
is identical to that of a low-resource target language. However, collecting
such training data can be infeasible because of the labeling cost, task
characteristics, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes an alternative
solution that uses only task-independent word embeddings of high-resource
languages and bilingual dictionaries. First, we construct a dictionary-based
heterogeneous graph (DHG) from bilingual dictionaries. This opens the
possibility to use graph neural networks for cross-lingual transfer. The
remaining challenge is the heterogeneity of DHG because multiple languages are
considered. To address this challenge, we propose dictionary-based
heterogeneous graph neural network (DHGNet) that effectively handles the
heterogeneity of DHG by two-step aggregations, which are word-level and
language-level aggregations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms pretrained models even though it does not access to large corpora.
Furthermore, it can perform well even though dictionaries contain many
incorrect translations. Its robustness allows the usage of a wider range of
dictionaries such as an automatically constructed dictionary and crowdsourced
dictionary, which are convenient for real-world applications.]]></summary>

rely on post-training behavior. We demonstrate that CAL is competitive to other
common AL methods, showing that training dynamics derived from small seed data

analyzing batch-level statistics utilizing the data maps. Our results further
show that CAL results in a more data-efficient learning strategy, achieving

augmentation strategy for neural machine translation (NMT), especially for
low-resource language pairs. To improve effectiveness of the available BT data,
we introduce HintedBT -- a family of techniques which provides hints (through
tags) to the encoder and decoder. First, we propose a novel method of using
both high and low quality BT data by providing hints (as source tags on the
encoder) to the model about the quality of each source-target pair. We don't
filter out low quality data but instead show that these hints enable the model
to learn effectively from noisy data. Second, we address the problem of
predicting whether a source token needs to be translated or transliterated to
the target language, which is common in cross-script translation tasks (i.e.,
where source and target do not share the written script). For such cases, we
propose training the model with additional hints (as target tags on the
decoder) that provide information about the operation required on the source
(translation or both translation and transliteration). We conduct experiments
and detailed analyses on standard WMT benchmarks for three cross-script
low/medium-resource language pairs: {Hindi,Gujarati,Tamil}-to-English. Our
methods compare favorably with five strong and well established baselines. We
show that using these hints, both separately and together, significantly
improves translation quality and leads to state-of-the-art performance in all
three language pairs in corresponding bilingual settings.]]></summary>

due to their heavy reliance on compositionality, fail in effectively capturing
the meanings of multiword expressions (MWEs), especially idioms. Therefore,
datasets and methods to improve the representation of MWEs are urgently needed.
Existing datasets are limited to providing the degree of idiomaticity of
expressions along with the literal and, where applicable, (a single)
non-literal interpretation of MWEs. This work presents a novel dataset of
naturally occurring sentences containing MWEs manually classified into a
fine-grained set of meanings, spanning both English and Portuguese. We use this
dataset in two tasks designed to test i) a language model's ability to detect
idiom usage, and ii) the effectiveness of a language model in generating
representations of sentences containing idioms. Our experiments demonstrate
that, on the task of detecting idiomatic usage, these models perform reasonably
well in the one-shot and few-shot scenarios, but that there is significant
scope for improvement in the zero-shot scenario. On the task of representing
idiomaticity, we find that pre-training is not always effective, while
fine-tuning could provide a sample efficient method of learning representations

staggering pace, with thousands of papers released every month. A large portion
of chemistry literature focuses on new molecules and reactions between
molecules. Most vital information is conveyed through 2-D images of molecules,
representing the underlying molecules or reactions described. In order to
ensure reproducible and machine-readable molecule representations, text-based
molecule descriptors like SMILES and SELFIES were created. These text-based
molecule representations provide molecule generation but are unfortunately
rarely present in published literature. In the absence of molecule descriptors,
the generation of molecule descriptors from the 2-D images present in the
literature is necessary to understand chemistry literature at scale. Successful
methods such as Optical Structure Recognition Application (OSRA), and
ChemSchematicResolver are able to extract the locations of molecules structures
in chemistry papers and infer molecular descriptions and reactions. While
effective, existing systems expect chemists to correct outputs, making them
unsuitable for unsupervised large-scale data mining. Leveraging the task
formulation of image captioning introduced by DECIMER, we introduce IMG2SMI, a
model which leverages Deep Residual Networks for image feature extraction and
an encoder-decoder Transformer layers for molecule description generation.
Unlike previous Neural Network-based systems, IMG2SMI builds around the task of
molecule description generation, which enables IMG2SMI to outperform OSRA-based
systems by 163% in molecule similarity prediction as measured by the molecular
MACCS Fingerprint Tanimoto Similarity. Additionally, to facilitate further

iteratively distorts an image by an additive noise until the model detects the
change in the image by outputting a false label. The noise added to the
original image is defined as the gradient of the cost function of the model. A
novel cost function is defined to explicitly minimize the amount of
perturbation applied to the input image while enforcing the perceptual
similarity between the adversarial and input images. For this purpose, the cost
function is regularized by the well-known total variation and bounded range
terms to meet the natural appearance of the adversarial image. We evaluate the
adversarial images generated by our algorithm both qualitatively and
quantitatively on CIFAR10, ImageNet, and MS COCO datasets. Our experiments on
image classification and object detection tasks show that adversarial images
generated by our JND method are both more successful in deceiving the
recognition/detection models and less perturbed compared to the images
generated by the state-of-the-art methods, namely, FGV, FSGM, and DeepFool
methods.]]></summary>

that numerous HOI classes have only a small number of labeled examples,
resulting in training sets with a long-tailed distribution. The lack of
positive labels can lead to low classification accuracy for these classes.
Towards addressing this issue, we observe that there exist natural correlations
and anti-correlations among human-object interactions. In this paper, we model
the correlations as action co-occurrence matrices and present techniques to
learn these priors and leverage them for more effective training, especially on
rare classes. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated experimentally,
where the performance of our approach consistently improves over the
state-of-the-art methods on both of the two leading HOI detection benchmark

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently received explosive popularity, but
the huge computational cost is still a severe issue. Since the computation
complexity of ViT is quadratic with respect to the input sequence length, a
mainstream paradigm for computation reduction is to reduce the number of
tokens. Existing designs include structured spatial compression that uses a
progressive shrinking pyramid to reduce the computations of large feature maps,
and unstructured token pruning that dynamically drops redundant tokens.
However, the limitation of existing token pruning lies in two folds: 1) the
incomplete spatial structure caused by pruning is not compatible with
structured spatial compression that is commonly used in modern deep-narrow
transformers; 2) it usually requires a time-consuming pre-training procedure.
To tackle the limitations and expand the applicable scenario of token pruning,
we present Evo-ViT, a self-motivated slow-fast token evolution approach for
vision transformers. Specifically, we conduct unstructured instance-wise token
selection by taking advantage of the simple and effective global class
attention that is native to vision transformers. Then, we propose to update the
selected informative tokens and uninformative tokens with different computation
paths, namely, slow-fast updating. Since slow-fast updating mechanism maintains
the spatial structure and information flow, Evo-ViT can accelerate vanilla
transformers of both flat and deep-narrow structures from the very beginning of
the training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly reduces the computational cost of vision transformers while
maintaining comparable performance on image classification.]]></summary>

performance compromise. Existing studies achieve the sparsity of neural
networks via time-consuming weight tuning or complex search on networks with
expanded width, which greatly limits the applications of network pruning. In
this paper, we show that high-performing and sparse sub-networks without the
involvement of weight tuning, termed "lottery jackpots", exist in pre-trained
models with unexpanded width. For example, we obtain a lottery jackpot that has
only 10% parameters and still reaches the performance of the original dense
VGGNet-19 without any modifications on the pre-trained weights. Furthermore, we
observe that the sparse masks derived from many existing pruning criteria have
a high overlap with the searched mask of our lottery jackpot, among which, the
magnitude-based pruning results in the most similar mask with ours. Based on
this insight, we initialize our sparse mask using the magnitude pruning,
resulting in at least 3x cost reduction on the lottery jackpot search while
achieves comparable or even better performance. Specifically, our
magnitude-based lottery jackpot removes 90% weights in the ResNet-50, while
easily obtains more than 70% top-1 accuracy using only 10 searching epochs on

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Particle physics simulations are the cornerstone of nuclear engineering
applications. Among them radiotherapy (RT) is crucial for society, with 50% of
cancer patients receiving radiation treatments. For the most precise targeting
of tumors, next generation RT treatments aim for real-time correction during
radiation delivery, necessitating particle transport algorithms that yield
precise dose distributions in sub-second times even in highly heterogeneous
patient geometries. This is infeasible with currently available, purely physics
based simulations. In this study, we present a data-driven dose calculation
algorithm predicting the dose deposited by mono-energetic proton beams for
arbitrary energies and patient geometries. Our approach frames particle
transport as sequence modeling, where convolutional layers extract important
spatial features into tokens and the transformer self-attention mechanism
routes information between such tokens in the sequence and a beam energy token.
We train our network and evaluate prediction accuracy using computationally
expensive but accurate Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, considered the gold
standard in particle physics. Our proposed model is 33 times faster than
current clinical analytic pencil beam algorithms, improving upon their accuracy
in the most heterogeneous and challenging geometries. With a relative error of
0.34% and very high gamma pass rate of 99.59% (1%, 3 mm), it also greatly
outperforms the only published similar data-driven proton dose algorithm, even
at a finer grid resolution. Offering MC precision 400 times faster, our model
could overcome a major obstacle that has so far prohibited real-time adaptive
proton treatments and significantly increase cancer treatment efficacy. Its
potential to model physics interactions of other particles could also boost
heavy ion treatment planning procedures limited by the speed of traditional
methods.]]></summary>

Motivated by traditional semantic parsing where compositionality is explicitly

preserves the expressivity and generality of sequence-to-sequence models while
featuring lexicon-style alignments and disentangled information processing.
Specifically, we decompose decoding into two phases where an input utterance is
first tagged with semantic symbols representing the meaning of individual
words, and then a sequence-to-sequence model is used to predict the final
meaning representation conditioning on the utterance and the predicted tag
sequence. Experimental results on three semantic parsing datasets show that the
proposed approach consistently improves compositional generalization across

strong performances on few-shot finetuning by reformulating downstream tasks as

advantages on low data regimes, finetuned prompt-based models for sentence pair
classification tasks still suffer from a common pitfall of adopting inference
heuristics based on lexical overlap, e.g., models incorrectly assuming a
sentence pair is of the same meaning because they consist of the same set of
words. Interestingly, we find that this particular inference heuristic is
significantly less present in the zero-shot evaluation of the prompt-based
model, indicating how finetuning can be destructive to useful knowledge learned
during the pretraining. We then show that adding a regularization that
preserves pretraining weights is effective in mitigating this destructive
tendency of few-shot finetuning. Our evaluation on three datasets demonstrates
promising improvements on the three corresponding challenge datasets used to

estimate consumer choice behavior. However, behavioral economics has provided
strong empirical evidence of irrational choice behavior, such as halo effects,
that are incompatible with this framework. Models belonging to the Random
Utility Maximization family may therefore not accurately capture such
irrational behavior. Hence, more general choice models, overcoming such
limitations, have been proposed. However, the flexibility of such models comes
at the price of increased risk of overfitting. As such, estimating such models
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose an estimation method for the
recently proposed Generalized Stochastic Preference choice model, which
subsumes the family of Random Utility Maximization models and is capable of
capturing halo effects. Specifically, we show how to use partially-ranked
preferences to efficiently model rational and irrational customer types from
transaction data. Our estimation procedure is based on column generation, where
relevant customer types are efficiently extracted by expanding a tree-like data
structure containing the customer behaviors. Further, we propose a new
dominance rule among customer types whose effect is to prioritize low orders of
interactions among products. An extensive set of experiments assesses the
predictive accuracy of the proposed approach. Our results show that accounting
for irrational preferences can boost predictive accuracy by 12.5% on average,
when tested on a real-world dataset from a large chain of grocery and drug

bandits (MAB) with multiple cooperative players. The reward obtained by the
players in each round depends on the actions taken by all the players. It's a
team setting, and the objective is common. Information asymmetry is what makes
the problem interesting and challenging. We consider three types of information
asymmetry: action information asymmetry when the actions of the players can't
be observed but the rewards received are common; reward information asymmetry
when the actions of the other players are observable but rewards received are
IID from the same distribution; and when we have both action and reward
information asymmetry. For the first setting, we propose a UCB-inspired
algorithm that achieves $O(\log T)$ regret whether the rewards are IID or
Markovian. For the second section, we offer an environment such that the
algorithm given for the first setting gives linear regret. For the third
setting, we show that a variation of the `explore then commit' algorithm
achieves almost log regret.]]></summary>

problem in visual scene understanding and yet remains challenging due to its
ill-posed nature and complexity in real-world scenes. To address those

propose a two-stage graph network for primitive-based 3D object estimation,
which consists of a sequential proposal module and a graph reasoning module.
Given a 2D image, our proposal module first generates a sequence of 3D
primitives from input image with local feature attention. Then the graph
reasoning module performs joint reasoning on a primitive graph to capture the
global shape context for each primitive. Such a framework is capable of taking
into account rich geometry and semantic constraints during 3D structure
recovery, producing 3D objects with more coherent structure even under
challenging viewing conditions. We train the entire graph neural network in a
stage-wise strategy and evaluate it on three benchmarks: Pix3D, ModelNet and

minimizing the difference of two convex functions, has been found rich
applications in statistical learning and studied extensively for decades.
However, existing methods are primarily based on multi-stage convex relaxation,
only leading to weak optimality of critical points. This paper proposes a
coordinate descent method for minimizing DC functions based on sequential
nonconvex approximation. Our approach iteratively solves a nonconvex
one-dimensional subproblem globally, and it is guaranteed to converge to a
coordinate-wise stationary point. We prove that this new optimality condition
is always stronger than the critical point condition and the directional point
condition when the objective function is weakly convex. For comparisons, we
also include a naive variant of coordinate descent methods based on sequential
convex approximation in our study. When the objective function satisfies an
additional regularity condition called \emph{sharpness}, coordinate descent
methods with an appropriate initialization converge \emph{linearly} to the
optimal solution set. Also, for many applications of interest, we show that the
nonconvex one-dimensional subproblem can be computed exactly and efficiently
using a breakpoint searching method. We present some discussions and extensions
of our proposed method. Finally, we have conducted extensive experiments on
several statistical learning tasks to show the superiority of our approach.

dimensionality of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
problems. This work considers a collection of $N_{\mathrm{pop}}$ heterogeneous
agents that can be segregated into $K$ classes such that the $k$-th class
contains $N_k$ homogeneous agents. We aim to prove approximation guarantees of
the MARL problem for this heterogeneous system by its corresponding MFC
problem. We consider three scenarios where the reward and transition dynamics
of all agents are respectively taken to be functions of $(1)$ joint state and
action distributions across all classes, $(2)$ individual distributions of each
class, and $(3)$ marginal distributions of the entire population. We show that,
in these cases, the $K$-class MARL problem can be approximated by MFC with
errors given as
$e_1=\mathcal{O}(\frac{\sqrt{|\mathcal{X}||\mathcal{U}|}}{N_{\mathrm{pop}}}\sum_{k}\sqrt{N_k})$,
$e_2=\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{|\mathcal{X}||\mathcal{U}|}\sum_{k}\frac{1}{\sqrt{N_k}})$

$e_3=\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{|\mathcal{X}||\mathcal{U}|}\left[\frac{A}{N_{\mathrm{pop}}}\sum_{k\in[K]}\sqrt{N_k}+\frac{B}{\sqrt{N_{\mathrm{pop}}}}\right]\right)$,
respectively, where $A, B$ are some constants and $|\mathcal{X}|,|\mathcal{U}|$
are the sizes of state and action spaces of each agent. Finally, we design a
Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) based algorithm that, in the three cases stated
above, can converge to an optimal MARL policy within $\mathcal{O}(e_j)$ error

graphs: starting from a matrix representation of the graph, the nodes are
clustered on a low dimensional projection obtained from a truncated spectral
decomposition of the matrix. Estimating correctly the number of communities and
the dimension of the reduced latent space is critical for good performance of
spectral clustering algorithms. Furthermore, many real-world graphs, such as
enterprise computer networks studied in cyber-security applications, often
display heterogeneous within-community degree distributions. Such heterogeneous
degree distributions are usually not well captured by standard spectral
clustering algorithms. In this article, a novel spectral clustering algorithm
is proposed for community detection under the degree-corrected stochastic
blockmodel. The proposed method is based on a transformation of the spectral
embedding to spherical coordinates, and a novel modelling assumption in the
transformed space. The method allows for simultaneous and automated selection
of the number of communities and the latent dimension for spectral embeddings
of graphs with uneven node degrees. Results show improved performance over
competing methods in representing computer networks.]]></summary>

misalignment, e.g., features of cats in the target domain might be mapped near
features of dogs in the source domain. In this paper, we propose a novel
method, termed Noise Tolerant Domain Adaptation, for WSDA. Specifically, we
adopt the cluster assumption and learn cluster discriminatively with class
prototypes in the embedding space. We propose to leverage the location
information of the data points in the embedding space and model the location
information with a Gaussian mixture model to identify noisy source data. We
then design a network which incorporates the Gaussian mixture noise model as a
sub-module for unsupervised noise removal and propose a novel cluster-level
adversarial adaptation method which aligns unlabeled target data with the less
noisy class prototypes for mapping the semantic structure across domains. We
conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method on
both general images and medical images from COVID-19 and e-commerce datasets.
The results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
WSDA methods.]]></summary>

the part predicted to be the most salient. In fall 2020, Twitter users raised
concerns that the automated image cropping system on Twitter favored
light-skinned over dark-skinned individuals, as well as concerns that the
system favored cropping woman's bodies instead of their heads. In order to
address these concerns, we conduct an extensive analysis using formalized group
fairness metrics. We find systematic disparities in cropping and identify
contributing factors, including the fact that the cropping based on the single
most salient point can amplify the disparities because of an effect we term
argmax bias. However, we demonstrate that formalized fairness metrics and
quantitative analysis on their own are insufficient for capturing the risk of
representational harm in automatic cropping. We suggest the removal of
saliency-based cropping in favor of a solution that better preserves user
agency. For developing a new solution that sufficiently address concerns
related to representational harm, our critique motivates a combination of
quantitative and qualitative methods that include human-centered design.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The proposition of lottery ticket hypothesis revealed the relationship
between network structure and initialization parameters and the learning
potential of neural networks. The original lottery ticket hypothesis performs
pruning and weight resetting after training convergence, exposing it to the
problem of forgotten learning knowledge and potential high cost of training.
Therefore, we propose a strategy that combines the idea of neural network
structure search with a pruning algorithm to alleviate this problem. This
algorithm searches and extends the network structure on existing winning ticket
sub-network to producing new winning ticket recursively. This allows the
training and pruning process to continue without compromising performance. A
new winning ticket sub-network with deeper network structure, better
generalization ability and better test performance can be obtained in this
recursive manner. This method can solve: the difficulty of training or
performance degradation of the sub-networks after pruning, the forgetting of
the weights of the original lottery ticket hypothesis and the difficulty of
generating winning ticket sub-network when the final network structure is not
given. We validate this strategy on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. And after
relating it to similar biological phenomena and relevant lottery ticket
hypothesis studies in recent years, we will further propose a new hypothesis to
discuss which factors that can keep a network juvenile, i.e., those possible
factors that influence the learning potential or generalization performance of
a neural network during training.]]></summary>

with integrated MLOps on edge devices, e.g., a camera, a microphone, or IoT
sensors. SensiX++ operates on two fundamental principles - highly modular
componentisation to externalise data operations with clear abstractions and
document-centric manifestation for system-wide orchestration. First, a data
coordinator manages the lifecycle of sensors and serves models with correct
data through automated transformations. Next, a resource-aware model server
executes multiple models in isolation through model abstraction, pipeline
automation and feature sharing. An adaptive scheduler then orchestrates the
best-effort executions of multiple models across heterogeneous accelerators,
balancing latency and throughput. Finally, microservices with REST APIs serve
synthesised model predictions, system statistics, and continuous deployment.
Collectively, these components enable SensiX++ to serve multiple models
efficiently with fine-grained control on edge devices while minimising data
operation redundancy, managing data and device heterogeneity, reducing resource
contention and removing manual MLOps. We benchmark SensiX++ with ten different
vision and acoustics models across various multi-tenant configurations on
different edge accelerators (Jetson AGX and Coral TPU) designed for sensory
devices. We report on the overall throughput and quantified benefits of various
automation components of SensiX++ and demonstrate its efficacy to significantly
reduce operational complexity and lower the effort to deploy, upgrade,
reconfigure and serve embedded models on edge devices.]]></summary>

increasing research interest in recent years. Most existing methods focus on
reasoning at past timestamps to complete the missing facts, and there are only
a few works of reasoning on known TKGs to forecast future facts. Compared with
the completion task, the forecasting task is more difficult that faces two main
challenges: (1) how to effectively model the time information to handle future
timestamps? (2) how to make inductive inference to handle previously unseen
entities that emerge over time? To address these challenges, we propose the
first reinforcement learning method for forecasting. Specifically, the agent
travels on historical knowledge graph snapshots to search for the answer. Our
method defines a relative time encoding function to capture the timespan
information, and we design a novel time-shaped reward based on Dirichlet
distribution to guide the model learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel
representation method for unseen entities to improve the inductive inference
ability of the model. We evaluate our method for this link prediction task at
future timestamps. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
substantial performance improvement meanwhile with higher explainability, less
calculation, and fewer parameters when compared with existing state-of-the-art

attention due to its efficacy to solve downstream tasks. Popular embedding
methods (such as deepwalk, node2vec, LINE) are based on a neural architecture,
thus unable to scale on large networks both in terms of time and space usage.
Recently, we proposed BinSketch, a sketching technique for compressing binary
vectors to binary vectors. In this paper, we show how to extend BinSketch and
use it for network hashing. Our proposal named QUINT is built upon BinSketch,
and it embeds nodes of a sparse network onto a low-dimensional space using
simple bi-wise operations. QUINT is the first of its kind that provides
tremendous gain in terms of speed and space usage without compromising much on
the accuracy of the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted to
compare QUINT with seven state-of-the-art network embedding methods for two end
tasks - link prediction and node classification. We observe huge performance
gain for QUINT in terms of speedup (up to 7000x) and space saving (up to 800x)
due to its bit-wise nature to obtain node embedding. Moreover, QUINT is a
consistent top-performer for both the tasks among the baselines across all the
datasets. Our empirical observations are backed by rigorous theoretical
analysis to justify the effectiveness of QUINT. In particular, we prove that
QUINT retains enough structural information which can be used further to
approximate many topological properties of networks with high confidence.]]></summary>

training data in high-resource source languages are available, where the task
is identical to that of a low-resource target language. However, collecting
such training data can be infeasible because of the labeling cost, task
characteristics, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes an alternative
solution that uses only task-independent word embeddings of high-resource
languages and bilingual dictionaries. First, we construct a dictionary-based
heterogeneous graph (DHG) from bilingual dictionaries. This opens the
possibility to use graph neural networks for cross-lingual transfer. The
remaining challenge is the heterogeneity of DHG because multiple languages are
considered. To address this challenge, we propose dictionary-based
heterogeneous graph neural network (DHGNet) that effectively handles the
heterogeneity of DHG by two-step aggregations, which are word-level and
language-level aggregations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms pretrained models even though it does not access to large corpora.
Furthermore, it can perform well even though dictionaries contain many
incorrect translations. Its robustness allows the usage of a wider range of
dictionaries such as an automatically constructed dictionary and crowdsourced
dictionary, which are convenient for real-world applications.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data augmentation has been widely used in image data and linguistic data but
remains under-explored on graph-structured data. Existing methods focus on
augmenting the graph data from a global perspective and largely fall into two
genres: structural manipulation and adversarial training with feature noise
injection. However, the structural manipulation approach suffers information
loss issues while the adversarial training approach may downgrade the feature
quality by injecting noise. In this work, we introduce the local augmentation,
which enhances node features by its local subgraph structures. Specifically, we
model the data argumentation as a feature generation process. Given the central
node's feature, our local augmentation approach learns the conditional
distribution of its neighbors' features and generates the neighbors' optimal
feature to boost the performance of downstream tasks. Based on the local
augmentation, we further design a novel framework: LA-GNN, which can apply to
any GNN models in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments and analyses
show that local augmentation consistently yields performance improvement for
various GNN architectures across a diverse set of benchmarks. Code is available

is often the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of manually labeled
examples. In contrast, textual imaging reports, which are often readily
available in medical records, contain rich but unstructured interpretations
written by experts as part of standard clinical practice. We propose using
these textual reports as a form of weak supervision to improve the image
interpretation performance of a neural network without requiring additional
manually labeled examples. We use an image-text matching task to train a
feature extractor and then fine-tune it in a transfer learning setting for a
supervised task using a small labeled dataset. The end result is a neural
network that automatically interprets imagery without requiring textual reports
during inference. This approach can be applied to any task for which text-image
pairs are readily available. We evaluate our method on three classification
tasks and find consistent performance improvements, reducing the need for
labeled data by 67%-98%.]]></summary>

similar objects, e.g., repairing a particular model of a car or laptop. In this
work we aim to reconstruct such objects and to localize associated narrations

where identical objects or scenes are present in all views, objects in
different instructional videos may have large appearance variations given
varying conditions and versions of the same product. Narrations may also have
large variation in natural language expressions. We address these challenges by
three contributions. First, we propose an approach for correspondence
estimation combining learnt local features and dense flow. Second, we design a
two-step divide and conquer reconstruction approach where the initial 3D
reconstructions of individual videos are combined into a 3D alignment graph.
Finally, we propose an unsupervised approach to ground natural language in
obtained 3D reconstructions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
for the domain of car maintenance. Given raw instructional videos and no manual

interpretation, reservoir characterization and well placement. Some recent
works regard it as an image segmentation task. The task of image segmentation
requires huge labels, especially 3D seismic data, which has a complex structure
and lots of noise. Therefore, its annotation requires expert experience and a
huge workload. In this study, we present lambda-BCE and lambda-smooth L1loss to
effectively train 3D-CNN by some slices from 3D seismic data, so that the model
can learn the segmentation of 3D seismic data from a few 2D slices. In order to
fully extract information from limited data and suppress seismic noise, we
propose an attention module that can be used for active supervision training
and embedded in the network. The attention heatmap label is generated by the
original label, and letting it supervise the attention module using the
lambda-smooth L1loss. The experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of our loss
function, the method can extract 3D seismic features from a few 2D slice
labels. And it also shows the advanced performance of the attention module,
which can significantly suppress the noise in the seismic data while increasing
the model's sensitivity to the foreground. Finally, on the public test set, we
only use the 2D slice labels training that accounts for 3.3% of the 3D volume
label, and achieve similar performance to the 3D volume label training.]]></summary>

stationary measure of ergodic It\^o diffusions from a discrete-time series that
approximate the solutions of the stochastic differential equations. To take an
advantage of the characterization of density function through the stationary
solution of a parabolic-type Fokker-Planck PDE, we proceed as follows. First,
we employ deep neural networks to approximate the drift and diffusion terms of
the SDE by solving appropriate supervised learning tasks. Subsequently, we
solve a steady-state Fokker-Plank equation associated with the estimated drift
and diffusion coefficients with a neural-network-based least-squares method. We
establish the convergence of the proposed scheme under appropriate mathematical
assumptions, accounting for the generalization errors induced by regressing the
drift and diffusion coefficients, and the PDE solvers. This theoretical study
relies on a recent perturbation theory of Markov chain result that shows a
linear dependence of the density estimation to the error in estimating the
drift term, and generalization error results of nonparametric regression and of
PDE regression solution obtained with neural-network models. The effectiveness
of this method is reflected by numerical simulations of a two-dimensional

pharmaceuticals, complex natural products, and commodity chemicals at scale.
However, the adoption of biocatalysis is limited by our ability to select
enzymes that will catalyze their natural chemical transformation on non-natural
substrates. While machine learning and in silico directed evolution are
well-posed for this predictive modeling challenge, efforts to date have
primarily aimed to increase activity against a single known substrate, rather
than to identify enzymes capable of acting on new substrates of interest. To
address this need, we curate 6 different high-quality enzyme family screens
from the literature that each measure multiple enzymes against multiple
substrates. We compare machine learning-based compound-protein interaction
(CPI) modeling approaches from the literature used for predicting drug-target
interactions. Surprisingly, comparing these interaction-based models against
collections of independent (single task) enzyme-only or substrate-only models
reveals that current CPI approaches are incapable of learning interactions
between compounds and proteins in the current family level data regime. We
further validate this observation by demonstrating that our no-interaction
baseline can outperform CPI-based models from the literature used to guide the
discovery of kinase inhibitors. Given the high performance of non-interaction
based models, we introduce a new structure-based strategy for pooling residue
representations across a protein sequence. Altogether, this work motivates a
principled path forward in order to build and evaluate meaningful predictive
models for biocatalysis and other drug discovery applications.]]></summary>

benefited from large annotated datasets, the amount of inference-related
knowledge (including commonsense) provided in the annotated data is still
rather limited. There have been two lines of approaches that can be used to
further address the limitation: (1) unsupervised pretraining can leverage
knowledge in much larger unstructured text data; (2) structured (often
human-curated) knowledge has started to be considered in neural-network-based
models for NLI. An immediate question is whether these two approaches
complement each other, or how to develop models that can bring together their
advantages. In this paper, we propose models that leverage structured knowledge
in different components of pre-trained models. Our results show that the
proposed models perform better than previous BERT-based state-of-the-art

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[3D point cloud semantic segmentation is a challenging topic in the computer
vision field. Most of the existing methods in literature require a large amount
of fully labeled training data, but it is extremely time-consuming to obtain
these training data by manually labeling massive point clouds. Addressing this
problem, we propose a superpoint-guided semi-supervised segmentation network
for 3D point clouds, which jointly utilizes a small portion of labeled scene
point clouds and a large number of unlabeled point clouds for network training.
The proposed network is iteratively updated with its predicted pseudo labels,
where a superpoint generation module is introduced for extracting superpoints
from 3D point clouds, and a pseudo-label optimization module is explored for
automatically assigning pseudo labels to the unlabeled points under the
constraint of the extracted superpoints. Additionally, there are some 3D points
without pseudo-label supervision. We propose an edge prediction module to
constrain features of edge points. A superpoint feature aggregation module and
a superpoint feature consistency loss function are introduced to smooth
superpoint features. Extensive experimental results on two 3D public datasets
demonstrate that our method can achieve better performance than several
state-of-the-art point cloud segmentation networks and several popular
semi-supervised segmentation methods with few labeled scenes.]]></summary>

of a dialogue system. Indeed, this has been confirmed empirically on systems
that utilise Bayesian approaches to dialogue belief tracking. However, such
systems consider only confidence estimates and have difficulty scaling to more
complex settings. Neural dialogue systems, on the other hand, rarely take
uncertainties into account. They are therefore overconfident in their decisions
and less robust. Moreover, the performance of the tracking task is often
evaluated in isolation, without consideration of its effect on the downstream
policy optimisation. We propose the use of different uncertainty measures in
neural belief tracking. The effects of these measures on the downstream task of
policy optimisation are evaluated by adding selected measures of uncertainty to
the feature space of the policy and training policies through interaction with
a user simulator. Both human and simulated user results show that incorporating
these measures leads to improvements both of the performance and of the
robustness of the downstream dialogue policy. This highlights the importance of
developing neural dialogue belief trackers that take uncertainty into account.]]></summary>

domains and are, as such, a popular target of attacks that subvert their
classification capabilities, by manipulating the network parameters. Prior work
has introduced sensitive samples -- inputs highly sensitive to parameter
changes -- to detect such manipulations, and proposed a gradient ascent-based
approach to compute them. In this paper we offer an alternative, using symbolic
constraint solvers. We model the network and a formal specification of a
sensitive sample in the language of the solver and ask for a solution. This
approach supports a rich class of queries, corresponding, for instance, to the
presence of certain types of attacks. Unlike earlier techniques, our approach
does not depend on convex search domains, or on the suitability of a starting
point for the search. We address the performance limitations of constraint
solvers by partitioning the search space for the solver, and exploring the
partitions according to a balanced schedule that still retains completeness of
the search. We demonstrate the impact of the use of solvers in terms of
functionality and search efficiency, using a case study for the detection of
Trojan attacks on Neural Networks.]]></summary>

labeled source samples and unlabeled target samples simultaneously to train the
model. While in some scenarios, the source samples are not available for the
target domain due to data privacy and safety. To overcome this challenge,
recently, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) has attracted the attention of
researchers, where both a trained source model and unlabeled target samples are
given. Existing SFDA methods either adopt a pseudo-label based strategy or
generate more samples. However, these methods do not explicitly reduce the
distribution shift across domains, which is the key to a good adaptation.
Although there are no source samples available, fortunately, we find that some
target samples are very similar to the source domain and can be used to
approximate the source domain. This approximated domain is denoted as the
pseudo-source domain. In this paper, inspired by this observation, we propose a
novel method based on the pseudo-source domain. The proposed method firstly
generates and augments the pseudo-source domain, and then employs distribution
alignment with four novel losses based on pseudo-label based strategy. Among
them, a domain adversarial loss is introduced between the pseudo-source domain
the remaining target domain to reduce the distribution shift. The results on
three real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.]]></summary>

increase in computational power, large datasets, deep convolutional neural
networks, optimizers etc. Particularly, the choice of optimizer affects the
generalization, convergence rate, and training stability. Stochastic Gradient
Descent (SGD) is a first order iterative optimizer that updates the gradient
uniformly for all parameters. This uniform update may not be suitable across
the entire training phase. A rudimentary solution for this is to employ a
fine-tuned learning rate scheduler which decreases learning rate as a function
of iteration. To eliminate the dependency of learning rate schedulers, adaptive
gradient optimizers such as AdaGrad, AdaDelta, RMSProp, Adam employ a
parameter-wise scaling term for learning rate which is a function of the
gradient itself. We propose Tom (Trend over Momentum) optimizer, which is a
novel variant of Adam that takes into account of the trend which is observed
for the gradients in the loss landscape traversed by the neural network. In the
proposed Tom optimizer, an additional smoothing equation is introduced to
address the trend observed during the process of optimization. The smoothing
parameter introduced for the trend requires no tuning and can be used with
default values. Experimental results for classification datasets such as
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and CINIC-10 image datasets show that Tom outperforms

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper considers the unsupervised domain adaptation problem for neural
machine translation (NMT), where we assume the access to only monolingual text
in either the source or target language in the new domain. We propose a
cross-lingual data selection method to extract in-domain sentences in the
missing language side from a large generic monolingual corpus. Our proposed
method trains an adaptive layer on top of multilingual BERT by contrastive
learning to align the representation between the source and target language.
This then enables the transferability of the domain classifier between the
languages in a zero-shot manner. Once the in-domain data is detected by the
classifier, the NMT model is then adapted to the new domain by jointly learning
translation and domain discrimination tasks. We evaluate our cross-lingual data
selection method on NMT across five diverse domains in three language pairs, as
well as a real-world scenario of translation for COVID-19. The results show
that our proposed method outperforms other selection baselines up to +1.5 BLEU
score.]]></summary>

a causal explanation, we derive an analogous set of axioms for the

first measure is a natural adaptation of Chockler and Halpern's notion of
causal responsibility, whereas the other two correspond to existing
game-theoretic influence measures. We present an axiomatic treatment for our
proposed indices, showing that they can be uniquely characterized by a set of

probabilistic approximation schemes for all of our proposed measures. Thus, our

distributionally robust optimization, which minimizes the worst-case expected

optimize this objective for large translation corpora using an iterated best
response scheme, which is both effective and incurs negligible additional

approach to Model Selection, that is an extension of the classical agnostic PAC
learning model. In this approach, learning problems are modeled not only by a
hypothesis space $\mathcal{H}$, but also by a Learning Space
$\mathbb{L}(\mathcal{H})$, a poset of subspaces of $\mathcal{H}$, which covers
$\mathcal{H}$ and satisfies a property regarding the VC dimension of related
subspaces, that is a suitable algebraic search space for Model Selection
algorithms. Our main contributions are a data-driven general learning algorithm
to perform regularized Model Selection on $\mathbb{L}(\mathcal{H})$ and a
framework under which one can, theoretically, better estimate a target
hypothesis with a given sample size by properly modeling
$\mathbb{L}(\mathcal{H})$ and employing high computational power. A remarkable
consequence of this approach are conditions under which a non-exhaustive search
of $\mathbb{L}(\mathcal{H})$ can return an optimal solution. The results of
this paper lead to a practical property of Machine Learning, that the lack of
experimental data may be mitigated by a high computational capacity. In a
context of continuous popularization of computational power, this property may
help understand why Machine Learning has become so important, even where data

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since many safety-critical systems, such as surgical robots and autonomous
driving cars operate in unstable environments with sensor noise and incomplete
data, it is desirable for object detectors to take the localization uncertainty
into account. However, there are several limitations of the existing
uncertainty estimation methods for anchor-based object detection. 1) They model
the uncertainty of the heterogeneous object properties with different
characteristics and scales, such as location (center point) and scale (width,
height), which could be difficult to estimate. 2) They model box offsets as
Gaussian distributions, which is not compatible with the ground truth bounding
boxes that follow the Dirac delta distribution. 3) Since anchor-based methods
are sensitive to anchor hyperparameters, the localization uncertainty for them
could be also highly sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters as well. To
tackle these limitations, we propose a new localization uncertainty estimation
method called UAD for anchor-free object detection. Our method captures the
uncertainty in four directions of box offsets~(left, right, top, bottom) that
are homogeneous, so that it can tell which direction is uncertain, and provides
a quantitative value of uncertainty in $[0, 1]$. To enable such uncertainty
estimation, we design a new uncertainty loss, negative power log-likelihood
loss, to measure the localization uncertainty by weighting the likelihood loss
by its IoU, which alleviates the model misspecification problem. Furthermore,
we propose an uncertainty-aware focal loss for reflecting the estimated
uncertainty to the classification score. Experimental results on COCO datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly improves FCOS, by up to 1.8 points,
without sacrificing computational efficiency.]]></summary>

these textual reports as a form of weak supervision to improve the image
interpretation performance of a neural network without requiring additional

network that automatically interprets imagery without requiring textual reports

by a failure to capture authorship writing style or by a topic shift. Motivated
by this, we propose the \emph{topic confusion} task where we switch the

allows us to distinguish two types of errors: those caused by the topic shift
and those caused by the features' inability to capture the writing styles. We
show that stylometric features with part-of-speech tags are the least
susceptible to topic variations. We further show that combining them with other

quantitative analysis on their own are insufficient for capturing the risk of
representational harm in automatic cropping. We suggest the removal of

significant progress has been made in analyzing object grasping from vision, it
remains unclear how we can utilize tactile sensing to reason about and model

high-resolution tactile glove to perform four different interactive activities
on a diversified set of objects. We build our model on a cross-modal learning
framework and generate the labels using a visual processing pipeline to
supervise the tactile model, which can then be used on its own during the test
time. The tactile model aims to predict the 3d locations of both the hand and
the object purely from the touch data by combining a predictive model and a
contrastive learning module. This framework can reason about the interaction
patterns from the tactile data, hallucinate the changes in the environment,
estimate the uncertainty of the prediction, and generalize to unseen objects.
We also provide detailed ablation studies regarding different system designs as
well as visualizations of the predicted trajectories. This work takes a step on
dynamics modeling in hand-object interactions from dense tactile sensing, which
opens the door for future applications in activity learning, human-computer

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present HoHoNet, a versatile and efficient framework for holistic
understanding of an indoor 360-degree panorama using a Latent Horizontal
Feature (LHFeat). The compact LHFeat flattens the features along the vertical
direction and has shown success in modeling per-column modality for room layout
reconstruction. HoHoNet advances in two important aspects. First, the deep
architecture is redesigned to run faster with improved accuracy. Second, we
propose a novel horizon-to-dense module, which relaxes the per-column output
shape constraint, allowing per-pixel dense prediction from LHFeat. HoHoNet is
fast: It runs at 52 FPS and 110 FPS with ResNet-50 and ResNet-34 backbones
respectively, for modeling dense modalities from a high-resolution $512 \times
1024$ panorama. HoHoNet is also accurate. On the tasks of layout estimation and
semantic segmentation, HoHoNet achieves results on par with current
state-of-the-art. On dense depth estimation, HoHoNet outperforms all the prior

distillation. Experiments with single and multi channel mixtures show that the

paper, we leverage human knowledge about spatial domain characteristics which
we refer to as 'local domains' and demonstrate its benefit for image-to-image

GAN on few source data and hallucinate a new unseen domain which subsequently
eases transfer learning to target. We experiment on three tasks ranging from
unstructured environments to adverse weather. Our comprehensive evaluation

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Physics-informed Machine Learning has recently become attractive for learning
physical parameters and features from simulation and observation data. However,
most existing methods do not ensure that the physics, such as balance laws
(e.g., mass, momentum, energy conservation), are constrained. Some recent works
(e.g., physics-informed neural networks) softly enforce physics constraints by
including partial differential equation (PDE)-based loss functions but need
re-discretization of the PDEs using auto-differentiation. Training these neural
nets on observational data showed that one could solve forward and inverse
problems in one shot. They evaluate the state variables and the parameters in a
PDE. This re-discretization of PDEs is not necessarily an attractive option for
domain scientists that work with physics-based codes that have been developed
for decades with sophisticated discretization techniques to solve complex
process models and advanced equations of state. This paper proposes a physics
constrained machine learning framework, AdjointNet, allowing domain scientists
to embed their physics code in neural network training workflows. This
embedding ensures that physics is constrained everywhere in the domain.
Additionally, the mathematical properties such as consistency, stability, and
convergence vital to the numerical solution of a PDE are still satisfied. We
show that the proposed AdjointNet framework can be used for parameter
estimation (and uncertainty quantification by extension) and experimental
design using active learning. The applicability of our framework is
demonstrated for four flow cases. Results show that AdjointNet-based inversion
can estimate process model parameters with reasonable accuracy. These examples
demonstrate the applicability of using existing software with no changes in
source code to perform accurate and reliable inversion of model parameters.]]></summary>

problem in visual scene understanding and yet remains challenging due to its

propose a two-stage graph network for primitive-based 3D object estimation,
which consists of a sequential proposal module and a graph reasoning module.
Given a 2D image, our proposal module first generates a sequence of 3D
primitives from input image with local feature attention. Then the graph
reasoning module performs joint reasoning on a primitive graph to capture the
global shape context for each primitive. Such a framework is capable of taking
into account rich geometry and semantic constraints during 3D structure
recovery, producing 3D objects with more coherent structure even under
challenging viewing conditions. We train the entire graph neural network in a
stage-wise strategy and evaluate it on three benchmarks: Pix3D, ModelNet and
NYU Depth V2. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms the

categories and 5,000 attributes. Generally, existing multi-modal datasets are
either limited in scale or modality diversity. Differently, our M5Product is
featured from the following aspects. First, the M5Product dataset is 500 times
larger than the public multimodal dataset with the same number of modalities
and nearly twice larger compared with the largest available text-image
cross-modal dataset. Second, the dataset contains rich information of multiple
modalities including image, text, table, video and audio, in which each
modality can capture different views of semantic information (e.g. category,
attributes, affordance, brand, preference) and complements the other. Third, to
better accommodate with real-world problems, a few portion of M5Product
contains incomplete modality pairs and noises while having the long-tailed
distribution, which aligns well with real-world scenarios. Finally, we provide
a baseline model M5-MMT that makes the first attempt to integrate the different
modality configuration into an unified model for feature fusion to address the
great challenge for semantic alignment. We also evaluate various multi-model

algorithm is employed to filter out mismatched pairs, thus allowing rough
localization of the counterfeit areas. To present more accurately these forgery
areas more accurately, we propose an efficient and accurate algorithm, evolving
circular domains coverage (ECDC), to cover present them. This algorithm aims to
find satisfactory threshold areas by extracting block features from jointly
evolving circular domains, which are centered on the matched pairs. Finally,
morphological operation is applied to refine the detected forgery areas. The
experimental results indicate that the proposed CMFD scheme can achieve better
detection performance under various attacks compared with other
state-of-the-art CMFD schemes.]]></summary>

procedures is a critical task for aligning preoperative data with
intraoperative geometry, ensuring effective surgical navigation and optimal
surgical precision. While the finite element method (FEM) is a proven technique
to effectively approximate soft tissue deformation through biomechanical
formulations, their degree of success boils down to a trade-off between
accuracy and speed. To circumvent this problem, the most recent works in this
domain have proposed leveraging data-driven models obtained by training various
machine learning algorithms, e.g. random forests, artificial neural networks
(ANNs), with the results of finite element analysis (FEA) to speed up tissue
deformation approximations by prediction. These methods, however, do not
account for the structure of the finite element (FE) mesh during training that
provides information on node connectivities as well as the distance between
them, which can aid with approximating tissue deformation based on the
proximity of force load points with the rest of the mesh nodes. Therefore, this
work proposes a novel framework, PhysGNN, a data-driven model that approximates
the solution of FEA by leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs), which are
capable of accounting for the mesh structural information and inductive
learning over unstructured grids and complex topological structures.
Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed architecture, PhysGNN, promises
accurate and fast soft tissue deformation approximations while remaining
computationally feasible, suitable for neurosurgical settings.]]></summary>

perpendicular to gravity. We leverage this phenomenon to approximate the scene

based on their plane orientation estimation; then, the succeeding instance
segmentation module conquers the task of planes clustering more easily in each
plane orientation group. Besides, parameters of V-planes depend on camera yaw
rotation, but translation-invariant CNNs are less aware of the yaw change. We
thus propose a yaw-invariant V-planar reparameterization for CNNs to learn. We
create a benchmark for indoor panorama planar reconstruction by extending
existing 360 depth datasets with ground truth H\&V-planes (referred to as
PanoH&V dataset) and adopt state-of-the-art planar reconstruction methods to

$L_\infty$-adversarial attack. The attack is parameter-free and does not

into small patches. Then we extract the unit component vectors and eigenvalues
of these patches with principal component analysis (PCA). Base on the

We then perform black-box attacks by sampling from the perturbation patches
according to their energy distribution, and tiling the sampled patches to form
a full-size adversarial perturbation. This can be done without the available
access to victim models. Extensive experiments well demonstrate that the
proposed Energy Attack achieves state-of-the-art performance in black-box

multi-layer perceptron blocks, have recently been found to reach comparable
results to convolutional and transformer-based methods. However, most adopt
spatial MLPs which take fixed dimension inputs, therefore making it difficult
to apply them to downstream tasks, such as object detection and semantic
segmentation. Moreover, single-stage designs further limit performance in other
computer vision tasks and fully connected layers bear heavy computation. To
tackle these problems, we propose ConvMLP: a hierarchical Convolutional MLP for
visual recognition, which is a light-weight, stage-wise, co-design of
convolution layers, and MLPs. In particular, ConvMLP-S achieves 76.8% top-1
accuracy on ImageNet-1k with 9M parameters and 2.4G MACs (15% and 19% of
MLP-Mixer-B/16, respectively). Experiments on object detection and semantic
segmentation further show that visual representation learned by ConvMLP can be
seamlessly transferred and achieve competitive results with fewer parameters.

intermediate representation for learning driving policies. However, the task of
street scene semantic segmentation requires expensive annotations. Furthermore,
segmentation algorithms are often trained irrespective of the actual driving
task, using auxiliary image-space loss functions which are not guaranteed to
maximize driving metrics such as safety or distance traveled per intervention.
In this work, we seek to quantify the impact of reducing segmentation
annotation costs on learned behavior cloning agents. We analyze several
segmentation-based intermediate representations. We use these visual
abstractions to systematically study the trade-off between annotation
efficiency and driving performance, i.e., the types of classes labeled, the
number of image samples used to learn the visual abstraction model, and their
granularity (e.g., object masks vs. 2D bounding boxes). Our analysis uncovers
several practical insights into how segmentation-based visual abstractions can
be exploited in a more label efficient manner. Surprisingly, we find that
state-of-the-art driving performance can be achieved with orders of magnitude
reduction in annotation cost. Beyond label efficiency, we find several
additional training benefits when leveraging visual abstractions, such as a
significant reduction in the variance of the learned policy when compared to
state-of-the-art end-to-end driving models.]]></summary>

task-specific fine-tuning on NLI, sentence similarity, or paraphrasing tasks
using annotated task data. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to
turn MLMs into effective universal lexical and sentence encoders even without
any additional data and without any supervision. We propose an extremely
simple, fast and effective contrastive learning technique, termed Mirror-BERT,
which converts MLMs (e.g., BERT and RoBERTa) into such encoders in 20-30
seconds without any additional external knowledge. Mirror-BERT relies on fully
identical or slightly modified string pairs as positive (i.e., synonymous)
fine-tuning examples, and aims to maximise their similarity during identity
fine-tuning. We report huge gains over off-the-shelf MLMs with Mirror-BERT in
both lexical-level and sentence-level tasks, across different domains and
different languages. Notably, in the standard sentence semantic similarity
(STS) tasks, our self-supervised Mirror-BERT model even matches the performance
of the task-tuned Sentence-BERT models from prior work. Finally, we delve
deeper into the inner workings of MLMs, and suggest some evidence on why this
simple approach can yield effective universal lexical and sentence encoders.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many implicit inferences exist in text depending on how it is structured that
can critically impact the text's interpretation and meaning. One such
structural aspect present in text with chronology is the order of its
presentation. For narratives or stories, this is known as the narrative order.
Reordering a narrative can impact the temporal, causal, event-based, and other
inferences readers draw from it, which in turn can have strong effects both on
its interpretation and interestingness. In this paper, we propose and
investigate the task of Narrative Reordering (NAREOR) which involves rewriting
a given story in a different narrative order while preserving its plot. We
present a dataset, NAREORC, with human rewritings of stories within ROCStories
in non-linear orders, and conduct a detailed analysis of it. Further, we
propose novel task-specific training methods with suitable evaluation metrics.
We perform experiments on NAREORC using state-of-the-art models such as BART
and T5 and conduct extensive automatic and human evaluations. We demonstrate
that although our models can perform decently, NAREOR is a challenging task
with potential for further exploration. We also investigate two applications of
NAREOR: generation of more interesting variations of stories and serving as
adversarial sets for temporal/event-related tasks, besides discussing other
prospective ones, such as for pedagogical setups related to language skills
like essay writing and applications to medicine involving clinical narratives.]]></summary>

requires an alignment of semantic concepts across domains. Despite the
widespread success of end-to-end learning, today's multimodal pipelines by and

Faster R-CNN, as representations of the visual world. The obvious downside is
that the visual representation is not specifically tuned to the multimodal task
at hand. At the same time, while transformer-based object detectors have gained
popularity, they have not been employed in today's multimodal pipelines. We
address both shortcomings with TxT, a transformer-based crossmodal pipeline
that enables fine-tuning both language and visual components on the downstream
task in a fully end-to-end manner. We overcome existing limitations of
transformer-based detectors for multimodal reasoning regarding the integration

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Extractive text summarization aims at extracting the most representative
sentences from a given document as its summary. To extract a good summary from
a long text document, sentence embedding plays an important role. Recent
studies have leveraged graph neural networks to capture the inter-sentential
relationship (e.g., the discourse graph) to learn contextual sentence
embedding. However, those approaches neither consider multiple types of
inter-sentential relationships (e.g., semantic similarity & natural
connection), nor model intra-sentential relationships (e.g, semantic &
syntactic relationship among words). To address these problems, we propose a
novel Multiplex Graph Convolutional Network (Multi-GCN) to jointly model
different types of relationships among sentences and words. Based on Multi-GCN,
we propose a Multiplex Graph Summarization (Multi-GraS) model for extractive
text summarization. Finally, we evaluate the proposed models on the
CNN/DailyMail benchmark dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the advent of advances in self-supervised learning, paired clean-noisy
data are no longer required in deep learning-based image denoising. However,
existing blind denoising methods still require the assumption with regard to
noise characteristics, such as zero-mean noise distribution and pixel-wise
noise-signal independence; this hinders wide adaptation of the method in the
medical domain. On the other hand, unpaired learning can overcome limitations
related to the assumption on noise characteristics, which makes it more
feasible for collecting the training data in real-world scenarios. In this
paper, we propose a novel image denoising scheme, Interdependent
Self-Cooperative Learning (ISCL), that leverages unpaired learning by combining
cyclic adversarial learning with self-supervised residual learning. Unlike the
existing unpaired image denoising methods relying on matching data
distributions in different domains, the two architectures in ISCL, designed for
different tasks, complement each other and boost the learning process. To
assess the performance of the proposed method, we conducted extensive
experiments in various biomedical image degradation scenarios, such as noise
caused by physical characteristics of electron microscopy (EM) devices (film
and charging noise), and structural noise found in low-dose computer tomography
(CT). We demonstrate that the image quality of our method is superior to
conventional and current state-of-the-art deep learning-based image denoising

Specifically, we devise a label transfer network (LTN) to transform the labels

from target distributions in high dimensions. While MCMC methods enjoy nice
theoretical properties, like guaranteed convergence and mixing to the true

proposal distribution and the target at hand. This work considers using machine
learning to adapt the proposal distribution to the target, in order to improve
the sampling efficiency in the purely discrete domain. Specifically, (i) it
proposes a new parametrization for a family of proposal distributions, called
locally balanced proposals, (ii) it defines an objective function based on
mutual information and (iii) it devises a learning procedure to adapt the
parameters of the proposal to the target, thus achieving fast convergence and
fast mixing. We call the resulting sampler as the Locally Self-Balancing
Sampler (LSB). We show through experimental analysis on the Ising model and
Bayesian networks that LSB is indeed able to improve the efficiency over a

augmentation strategy for neural machine translation (NMT), especially for
low-resource language pairs. To improve effectiveness of the available BT data,
we introduce HintedBT -- a family of techniques which provides hints (through
tags) to the encoder and decoder. First, we propose a novel method of using
both high and low quality BT data by providing hints (as source tags on the
encoder) to the model about the quality of each source-target pair. We don't
filter out low quality data but instead show that these hints enable the model
to learn effectively from noisy data. Second, we address the problem of
predicting whether a source token needs to be translated or transliterated to
the target language, which is common in cross-script translation tasks (i.e.,
where source and target do not share the written script). For such cases, we
propose training the model with additional hints (as target tags on the
decoder) that provide information about the operation required on the source
(translation or both translation and transliteration). We conduct experiments
and detailed analyses on standard WMT benchmarks for three cross-script
low/medium-resource language pairs: {Hindi,Gujarati,Tamil}-to-English. Our
methods compare favorably with five strong and well established baselines. We
show that using these hints, both separately and together, significantly
improves translation quality and leads to state-of-the-art performance in all
three language pairs in corresponding bilingual settings.]]></summary>

increasing research interest in recent years. Most existing methods focus on

a few works of reasoning on known TKGs to forecast future facts. Compared with
the completion task, the forecasting task is more difficult that faces two main
challenges: (1) how to effectively model the time information to handle future
timestamps? (2) how to make inductive inference to handle previously unseen
entities that emerge over time? To address these challenges, we propose the
first reinforcement learning method for forecasting. Specifically, the agent
travels on historical knowledge graph snapshots to search for the answer. Our
method defines a relative time encoding function to capture the timespan
information, and we design a novel time-shaped reward based on Dirichlet
distribution to guide the model learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel
representation method for unseen entities to improve the inductive inference
ability of the model. We evaluate our method for this link prediction task at

language models, and use an information-theoretic approach to measure the
extractability of certain biases from the model's representations. We

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Contrastive learning has been gradually applied to learn high-quality
unsupervised sentence embedding. Among the previous un-supervised methods, the
latest state-of-the-art method, as far as we know, is unsupervised SimCSE
(unsup-SimCSE). Unsup-SimCSE uses the InfoNCE1loss function in the training
stage by pulling semantically similar sentences together and pushing apart
dis-similar ones.Theoretically, we expect to use larger batches in unsup-SimCSE
to get more adequate comparisons among samples and avoid overfitting. However,
increasing the batch size does not always lead to improvements, but instead
even lead to performance degradation when the batch size exceeds a threshold.
Through statistical observation, we find that this is probably due to the
introduction of low-confidence negative pairs after in-creasing the batch size.
To alleviate this problem, we introduce a simple smoothing strategy upon the
InfoNCE loss function, termedGaussian Smoothing InfoNCE
(GS-InfoNCE).Specifically, we add random Gaussian noise vectors as negative
samples, which act asa smoothing of the negative sample space.Though being
simple, the proposed smooth-ing strategy brings substantial improvements to
unsup-SimCSE. We evaluate GS-InfoNCEon the standard semantic text similarity
(STS)task. GS-InfoNCE outperforms the state-of-the-art unsup-SimCSE by an
average Spear-man correlation of 1.38%, 0.72%, 1.17% and0.28% on the base of
BERT-base, BERT-large,RoBERTa-base and RoBERTa-large, respectively.]]></summary>

a new unseen scenario despite the success in cross-camera person matching.
Recent efforts have been substantially devoted to domain adaptive person re-id
where extensive unlabeled data in the new scenario are utilized in a
transductive learning manner. However, for each scenario, it is required to
first collect enough data and then train such a domain adaptive re-id model,
thus restricting their practical application. Instead, we aim to explore
multiple labeled datasets to learn generalized domain-invariant representations
for person re-id, which is expected universally effective for each new-coming
re-id scenario. To pursue practicability in real-world systems, we collect all
the person re-id datasets (20 datasets) in this field and select the three most
frequently used datasets (i.e., Market1501, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17) as unseen
target domains. In addition, we develop DataHunter that collects over 300K+
weak annotated images named YouTube-Human from YouTube street-view videos,
which joins 17 remaining full labeled datasets to form multiple source domains.
On such a large and challenging benchmark called FastHuman (~440K+ labeled
images), we further propose a simple yet effective Semi-Supervised Knowledge
Distillation (SSKD) framework. SSKD effectively exploits the weakly annotated
data by assigning soft pseudo labels to YouTube-Human to improve models'
generalization ability. Experiments on several protocols verify the
effectiveness of the proposed SSKD framework on domain generalizable person
re-id, which is even comparable to supervised learning on the target domains.
Lastly, but most importantly, we hope the proposed benchmark FastHuman could
bring the next development of domain generalizable person re-id algorithms.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep metric learning (DML) is a cornerstone of many computer vision
applications. It aims at learning a mapping from the input domain to an
embedding space, where semantically similar objects are located nearby and
dissimilar objects far from another. The target similarity on the training data
is defined by user in form of ground-truth class labels. However, while the
embedding space learns to mimic the user-provided similarity on the training
data, it should also generalize to novel categories not seen during training.
Besides user-provided groundtruth training labels, a lot of additional visual
factors (such as viewpoint changes or shape peculiarities) exist and imply
different notions of similarity between objects, affecting the generalization
on the images unseen during training. However, existing approaches usually
directly learn a single embedding space on all available training data,
struggling to encode all different types of relationships, and do not
generalize well. We propose to build a more expressive representation by
jointly splitting the embedding space and the data hierarchically into smaller
sub-parts. We successively focus on smaller subsets of the training data,
reducing its variance and learning a different embedding subspace for each data
subset. Moreover, the subspaces are learned jointly to cover not only the
intricacies, but the breadth of the data as well. Only after that, we build the
final embedding from the subspaces in the conquering stage. The proposed
algorithm acts as a transparent wrapper that can be placed around arbitrary
existing DML methods. Our approach significantly improves upon the
state-of-the-art on image retrieval, clustering, and re-identification tasks
evaluated using CUB200-2011, CARS196, Stanford Online Products, In-shop

performance by bridging the gap between pre-training tasks and various
downstream tasks. Among these methods, prompt tuning, which freezes PLMs and
only tunes soft prompts, provides an efficient and effective solution for
adapting large-scale PLMs to downstream tasks. However, prompt tuning is yet to
be fully explored. In our pilot experiments, we find that prompt tuning
performs comparably with conventional full-model fine-tuning when downstream
data are sufficient, whereas it performs much worse under few-shot learning
settings, which may hinder the application of prompt tuning in practice. We
attribute this low performance to the manner of initializing soft prompts.
Therefore, in this work, we propose to pre-train prompts by adding soft prompts
into the pre-training stage to obtain a better initialization. We name this
Pre-trained Prompt Tuning framework "PPT". To ensure the generalization of PPT,
we formulate similar classification tasks into a unified task form and
pre-train soft prompts for this unified task. Extensive experiments show that
tuning pre-trained prompts for downstream tasks can reach or even outperform
full-model fine-tuning under both full-data and few-shot settings. Our approach
is effective and efficient for using large-scale PLMs in practice.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, the textual adversarial attack models become increasingly popular
due to their successful in estimating the robustness of NLP models. However,
existing works have obvious deficiencies. (1) They usually consider only a
single granularity of modification strategies (e.g. word-level or
sentence-level), which is insufficient to explore the holistic textual space
for generation; (2) They need to query victim models hundreds of times to make
a successful attack, which is highly inefficient in practice. To address such
problems, in this paper we propose MAYA, a Multi-grAnularitY Attack model to
effectively generate high-quality adversarial samples with fewer queries to
victim models. Furthermore, we propose a reinforcement-learning based method to
train a multi-granularity attack agent through behavior cloning with the expert
knowledge from our MAYA algorithm to further reduce the query times.
Additionally, we also adapt the agent to attack black-box models that only
output labels without confidence scores. We conduct comprehensive experiments
to evaluate our attack models by attacking BiLSTM, BERT and RoBERTa in two
different black-box attack settings and three benchmark datasets. Experimental
results show that our models achieve overall better attacking performance and
produce more fluent and grammatical adversarial samples compared to baseline
models. Besides, our adversarial attack agent significantly reduces the query
times in both attack settings. Our codes are released at

examples. In this paper, we posit that adversarial attacks on transformers

specifically, we introduce a dual attack framework, which contains a Pay No

adversarial samples across different ViTs. We show that skipping the gradients
of attention during backpropagation can generate adversarial examples with high
transferability. In addition, adversarial perturbations generated by optimizing
randomly sampled subsets of patches at each iteration achieve higher attack
success rates than attacks using all patches. We evaluate the transferability
of attacks on state-of-the-art ViTs, CNNs and robustly trained CNNs. The
results of these experiments demonstrate that the proposed dual attack can
greatly boost transferability between ViTs and from ViTs to CNNs. In addition,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Facial editing is an important task in vision and graphics with numerous
applications. However, existing works are incapable to deliver a continuous and
fine-grained editing mode (e.g., editing a slightly smiling face to a big
laughing one) with natural interactions with users. In this work, we propose
Talk-to-Edit, an interactive facial editing framework that performs
fine-grained attribute manipulation through dialog between the user and the
system. Our key insight is to model a continual "semantic field" in the GAN
latent space. 1) Unlike previous works that regard the editing as traversing
straight lines in the latent space, here the fine-grained editing is formulated
as finding a curving trajectory that respects fine-grained attribute landscape
on the semantic field. 2) The curvature at each step is location-specific and
determined by the input image as well as the users' language requests. 3) To
engage the users in a meaningful dialog, our system generates language feedback
by considering both the user request and the current state of the semantic
field.

We also contribute CelebA-Dialog, a visual-language facial editing dataset to
facilitate large-scale study. Specifically, each image has manually annotated
fine-grained attribute annotations as well as template-based textual
descriptions in natural language. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework in terms of 1) the
smoothness of fine-grained editing, 2) the identity/attribute preservation, and
3) the visual photorealism and dialog fluency. Notably, user study validates
that our overall system is consistently favored by around 80% of the
participants. Our project page is https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/project/talkedit/.]]></summary>

equations and commonsense knowledge; (2) automatically fuses equation and
commonsense knowledge information via a self-planning module when generating
the MWPs. Experiments on an educational gold-standard set and a large-scale
generated MWP set show that our approach is superior on the MWP generation
task, and it outperforms the SOTA models in terms of both automatic evaluation
metrics, i.e., BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, Self-BLEU, and human evaluation metrics, i.e.,
equation relevance, topic relevance, and language coherence. To encourage
reproducible results, we make our code and MWP dataset public available at

processing (NLP) research. Many existing state-of-the-art models are first
pre-trained on a large text corpus and then fine-tuned on downstream tasks.
However, due to limited data resources from downstream tasks and the extremely
large capacity of pre-trained models, aggressive fine-tuning often causes the
adapted model to overfit the data of downstream tasks and forget the knowledge
of the pre-trained model. To address the above issue in a more principled
manner, we propose a new computational framework for robust and efficient
fine-tuning for pre-trained language models. Specifically, our proposed
framework contains two important ingredients: 1. Smoothness-inducing
regularization, which effectively manages the capacity of the model; 2. Bregman
proximal point optimization, which is a class of trust-region methods and can
prevent knowledge forgetting. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multiple NLP benchmarks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning has achieved remarkable progress for visual recognition on
large-scale balanced datasets but still performs poorly on real-world
long-tailed data. Previous methods often adopt class re-balanced training
strategies to effectively alleviate the imbalance issue, but might be a risk of
over-fitting tail classes. The recent decoupling method overcomes over-fitting
issues by using a multi-stage training scheme, yet, it is still incapable of
capturing tail class information in the feature learning stage. In this paper,
we show that soft label can serve as a powerful solution to incorporate label
correlation into a multi-stage training scheme for long-tailed recognition. The
intrinsic relation between classes embodied by soft labels turns out to be
helpful for long-tailed recognition by transferring knowledge from head to tail
classes.

Specifically, we propose a conceptually simple yet particularly effective
multi-stage training scheme, termed as Self Supervised to Distillation (SSD).
This scheme is composed of two parts. First, we introduce a self-distillation
framework for long-tailed recognition, which can mine the label relation
automatically. Second, we present a new distillation label generation module
guided by self-supervision. The distilled labels integrate information from
both label and data domains that can model long-tailed distribution
effectively. We conduct extensive experiments and our method achieves the
state-of-the-art results on three long-tailed recognition benchmarks:
ImageNet-LT, CIFAR100-LT and iNaturalist 2018. Our SSD outperforms the strong
LWS baseline by from $2.7\%$ to $4.5\%$ on various datasets. The code is
available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/SSD-LT.]]></summary>

areas in computer vision, pattern recognition, and even the general field of
artificial intelligence. It has great fundamental importance and strong
industrial needs. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have largely boosted their
performances on many concrete tasks, with the help of large amounts of training
data and new powerful computation resources. Though recognition accuracy is
usually the first concern for new progresses, efficiency is actually rather
important and sometimes critical for both academic research and industrial
applications. Moreover, insightful views on the opportunities and challenges of
efficiency are also highly required for the entire community. While general
surveys on the efficiency issue of DNNs have been done from various
perspectives, as far as we are aware, scarcely any of them focused on visual
recognition systematically, and thus it is unclear which progresses are
applicable to it and what else should be concerned. In this paper, we present
the review of the recent advances with our suggestions on the new possible
directions towards improving the efficiency of DNN-related visual recognition
approaches. We investigate not only from the model but also the data point of
view (which is not the case in existing surveys), and focus on three most
studied data types (images, videos and points). This paper attempts to provide
a systematic summary via a comprehensive survey which can serve as a valuable
reference and inspire both researchers and practitioners who work on visual
recognition problems.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most recent semantic segmentation methods adopt a U-Net framework with an
encoder-decoder architecture. It is still challenging for U-Net with a simple
skip connection scheme to model the global multi-scale context: 1) Not each
skip connection setting is effective due to the issue of incompatible feature
sets of encoder and decoder stage, even some skip connection negatively
influence the segmentation performance; 2) The original U-Net is worse than the
one without any skip connection on some datasets. Based on our findings, we
propose a new segmentation framework, named UCTransNet (with a proposed CTrans
module in U-Net), from the channel perspective with attention mechanism.
Specifically, the CTrans module is an alternate of the U-Net skip connections,
which consists of a sub-module to conduct the multi-scale Channel Cross fusion
with Transformer (named CCT) and a sub-module Channel-wise Cross-Attention
(named CCA) to guide the fused multi-scale channel-wise information to
effectively connect to the decoder features for eliminating the ambiguity.
Hence, the proposed connection consisting of the CCT and CCA is able to replace
the original skip connection to solve the semantic gaps for an accurate
automatic medical image segmentation. The experimental results suggest that our
UCTransNet produces more precise segmentation performance and achieves
consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art for semantic segmentation
across different datasets and conventional architectures involving transformer
or U-shaped framework. Code: https://github.com/McGregorWwww/UCTransNet.]]></summary>

emergence of pre-trained language models. Current pre-training works in
abstractive summarization give more points to the summaries with more words in

between generated sentences and the original document. We propose ARMAN, a
Transformer-based encoder-decoder model pre-trained with three novel objectives
to address this issue. In ARMAN, salient sentences from a document are selected
according to a modified semantic score to be masked and form a pseudo summary.
To summarize more accurately and similar to human writing patterns, we applied
modified sentence reordering. We evaluated our proposed models on six
downstream Persian summarization tasks. Experimental results show that our
proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all six summarization
tasks measured by ROUGE and BERTScore. Our models also outperform prior works
in textual entailment, question paraphrasing, and multiple choice question
answering. Finally, we established a human evaluation and show that using the
semantic score significantly improves summarization results.]]></summary>

parameters of Language Models (LMs) can be useful in downstream tasks (e.g.,
question answering or textual inference). However, some facts can be
incorrectly induced or become obsolete over time. We present KnowledgeEditor, a
method which can be used to edit this knowledge and, thus, fix 'bugs' or
unexpected predictions without the need for expensive re-training or
fine-tuning. Besides being computationally efficient, KnowledgeEditordoes not
require any modifications in LM pre-training (e.g., the use of meta-learning).
In our approach, we train a hyper-network with constrained optimization to
modify a fact without affecting the rest of the knowledge; the trained
hyper-network is then used to predict the weight update at test time. We show
KnowledgeEditor's efficacy with two popular architectures and
knowledge-intensive tasks: i) a BERT model fine-tuned for fact-checking, and
ii) a sequence-to-sequence BART model for question answering. With our method,
changing a prediction on the specific wording of a query tends to result in a
consistent change in predictions also for its paraphrases. We show that this
can be further encouraged by exploiting (e.g., automatically-generated)
paraphrases during training. Interestingly, our hyper-network can be regarded
as a 'probe' revealing which components need to be changed to manipulate
factual knowledge; our analysis shows that the updates tend to be concentrated

during annotation, rendering the training signal weak and noisy. This problem
is exacerbated when the questions are unanswerable or when the answers are
Boolean, since the model cannot rely on lexical overlap to make a connection
between the answer and supporting evidence. We develop a new parameterization
of set-valued retrieval that handles unanswerable queries, and we show that
marginalizing over this set during training allows a model to mitigate false
negatives in supporting evidence annotations. We test our method on two
multi-document QA datasets, IIRC and HotpotQA. On IIRC, we show that joint
modeling with marginalization improves model performance by 5.5 F1 points and
achieves a new state-of-the-art performance of 50.5 F1. We also show that
retrieval marginalization results in 4.1 QA F1 improvement over a
non-marginalized baseline on HotpotQA in the fullwiki setting.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID) are ubiquitous in several
manufacturing, oil and gas enterprises for representing engineering schematics
and equipment layout. There is an urgent need to extract and digitize
information from P&IDs without the cost of annotating a varying set of symbols
for each new use case. A robust one-shot learning approach for symbol
recognition i.e., localization followed by classification, would therefore go a
long way towards this goal. Our method works by sampling pixels sequentially
along the different contour boundaries in the image. These sampled points form
paths which are used in the prototypical line diagram to construct a graph that
captures the structure of the contours. Subsequently, the prototypical graphs
are fed into a Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) which is
trained to classify graphs into one of the given symbol classes. Further, we
append embeddings from a Resnet-34 network which is trained on symbol images
containing sampled points to make the classification network more robust.
Since, many symbols in P&ID are structurally very similar to each other, we
utilize Arcface loss during DGCNN training which helps in maximizing symbol
class separability by producing highly discriminative embeddings. The images
consist of components attached on the pipeline (straight line). The sampled
points segregated around the symbol regions are used for the classification
task. The proposed pipeline, named OSSR-PID, is fast and gives outstanding
performance for recognition of symbols on a synthetic dataset of 100 P&ID
diagrams. We also compare our method against prior-work on a real-world private
dataset of 12 P&ID sheets and obtain comparable/superior results. Remarkably,
it is able to achieve such excellent performance using only one prototypical
example per symbol.]]></summary>

achieve satisfactory performance. In multimedia analysis, domain adaptation
studies the problem of cross-domain knowledge transfer from a label rich source
domain to a label scarce target domain, thus potentially alleviates the
annotation requirement for deep learning models. However, we find that
contemporary domain adaptation methods for cross-domain image understanding
perform poorly when source domain is noisy. Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation
(WSDA) studies the domain adaptation problem under the scenario where source
data can be noisy. Prior methods on WSDA remove noisy source data and align the
marginal distribution across domains without considering the fine-grained
semantic structure in the embedding space, which have the problem of class
misalignment, e.g., features of cats in the target domain might be mapped near
features of dogs in the source domain. In this paper, we propose a novel
method, termed Noise Tolerant Domain Adaptation, for WSDA. Specifically, we
adopt the cluster assumption and learn cluster discriminatively with class
prototypes in the embedding space. We propose to leverage the location
information of the data points in the embedding space and model the location
information with a Gaussian mixture model to identify noisy source data. We
then design a network which incorporates the Gaussian mixture noise model as a
sub-module for unsupervised noise removal and propose a novel cluster-level
adversarial adaptation method which aligns unlabeled target data with the less
noisy class prototypes for mapping the semantic structure across domains. We
conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method on
both general images and medical images from COVID-19 and e-commerce datasets.
The results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
WSDA methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Contrastive learning has been attracting much attention for learning
unsupervised sentence embeddings. The current state-of-the-art unsupervised
method is the unsupervised SimCSE (unsup-SimCSE). Unsup-SimCSE takes dropout as
a minimal data augmentation method, and passes the same input sentence to a
pre-trained Transformer encoder (with dropout turned on) twice to obtain the
two corresponding embeddings to build a positive pair. As the length
information of a sentence will generally be encoded into the sentence
embeddings due to the usage of position embedding in Transformer, each positive
pair in unsup-SimCSE actually contains the same length information. And thus
unsup-SimCSE trained with these positive pairs is probably biased, which would
tend to consider that sentences of the same or similar length are more similar
in semantics. Through statistical observations, we find that unsup-SimCSE does
have such a problem. To alleviate it, we apply a simple repetition operation to
modify the input sentence, and then pass the input sentence and its modified
counterpart to the pre-trained Transformer encoder, respectively, to get the
positive pair. Additionally, we draw inspiration from the community of computer
vision and introduce a momentum contrast, enlarging the number of negative
pairs without additional calculations. The proposed two modifications are
applied on positive and negative pairs separately, and build a new sentence
embedding method, termed Enhanced Unsup-SimCSE (ESimCSE). We evaluate the
proposed ESimCSE on several benchmark datasets w.r.t the semantic text
similarity (STS) task. Experimental results show that ESimCSE outperforms the
state-of-the-art unsup-SimCSE by an average Spearman correlation of 2.02% on

framework based on non-autoregressive (NAR) models. End-to-end speech
translation models have several advantages over traditional cascade systems
such as inference latency reduction. However, conventional AR decoding methods
are not fast enough because each token is generated incrementally. NAR models,
however, can accelerate the decoding speed by generating multiple tokens in
parallel on the basis of the token-wise conditional independence assumption. We
propose a unified NAR E2E-ST framework called Orthros, which has an NAR decoder
and an auxiliary shallow AR decoder on top of the shared encoder. The auxiliary
shallow AR decoder selects the best hypothesis by rescoring multiple candidates
generated from the NAR decoder in parallel (parallel AR rescoring). We adopt
conditional masked language model (CMLM) and a connectionist temporal
classification (CTC)-based model as NAR decoders for Orthros, referred to as
Orthros-CMLM and Orthros-CTC, respectively. We also propose two training
methods to enhance the CMLM decoder. Experimental evaluations on three
benchmark datasets with six language directions demonstrated that Orthros
achieved large improvements in translation quality with a very small overhead
compared with the baseline NAR model. Moreover, the Conformer encoder
architecture enabled large quality improvements, especially for CTC-based
models. Orthros-CTC with the Conformer encoder increased decoding speed by
3.63x on CPU with translation quality comparable to that of an AR model.]]></summary>

large (320 on average), making summarization - and especially training a
summarizer - impractical. Moreover, the content of many reviews is not
reflected in the human-written summaries, and, thus, the summarizer trained on
random review subsets hallucinates. In order to deal with both of these
challenges, we formulate the task as jointly learning to select informative
subsets of reviews and summarizing the opinions expressed in these subsets. The
choice of the review subset is treated as a latent variable, predicted by a
small and simple selector. The subset is then fed into a more powerful

the question of whether valid attacks are actually feasible. In this work, we
investigate this through the lens of human language ability. We report on

causing a sentiment classification model to misclassify the example. Our
findings suggest that humans are capable of generating a substantial amount of

how human-generated adversarial examples compare to the recently proposed
TextFooler, Genetic, BAE and SememePSO attack algorithms on the dimensions

captured by schemas of the knowledge bases on which they're trained.

To address this limitation, we investigate training commonsense knowledge
models in a few-shot setting with limited tuples per commonsense relation in
the graph. We perform five separate studies on different dimensions of few-shot
commonsense knowledge learning, providing a roadmap on best practices for
training these systems efficiently. Importantly, we find that human quality
ratings for knowledge produced from a few-shot trained system can achieve
performance within 6% of knowledge produced from fully supervised systems. This
few-shot performance enables coverage of a wide breadth of relations in future

evasion in accessing the original complete training dataset, its poor
performance also stems from this limitation. To alleviate this limitation, in
this paper, we leverage the synthetic data introduced by zero-shot quantization
with calibration dataset and we propose a fine-grained data distribution
alignment (FDDA) method to boost the performance of post-training quantization.
The method is based on two important properties of batch normalization
statistics (BNS) we observed in deep layers of the trained network, i.e.,
inter-class separation and intra-class incohesion. To preserve this
fine-grained distribution information: 1) We calculate the per-class BNS of the
calibration dataset as the BNS centers of each class and propose a
BNS-centralized loss to force the synthetic data distributions of different
classes to be close to their own centers. 2) We add Gaussian noise into the
centers to imitate the incohesion and propose a BNS-distorted loss to force the
synthetic data distribution of the same class to be close to the distorted
centers. By introducing these two fine-grained losses, our method shows the
state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet, especially when the first and last
layers are quantized to low-bit as well. Our project is available at

is still a wide performance gap in semantic parsing tasks when target language

(TaF) method to produce silver training data for a multilingual semantic

pipeline and consists of a sequence-to-sequence filler model that constructs a
full parse conditioned on an utterance and a view of the same parse. Our filler
is trained on English data only but can accurately complete instances in other

that aligns a pair of point cloud fragments. We present an efficient and robust
framework for pairwise registration of real-world 3D scans, leveraging Hough
voting in the 6D transformation parameter space. First, deep geometric features
are extracted from a point cloud pair to compute putative correspondences. We
then construct a set of triplets of correspondences to cast votes on the 6D

Next, a fully convolutional refinement module is applied to refine the noisy

Hough space, which we use to predict our final transformation parameters. Our
method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch benchmarks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, multilingual machine translation is receiving more and more
attention since it brings better performance for low resource languages (LRLs)
and saves more space. However, existing multilingual machine translation models
face a severe challenge: imbalance. As a result, the translation performance of
different languages in multilingual translation models are quite different. We
argue that this imbalance problem stems from the different learning
competencies of different languages. Therefore, we focus on balancing the
learning competencies of different languages and propose Competence-based
Curriculum Learning for Multilingual Machine Translation, named CCL-M.
Specifically, we firstly define two competencies to help schedule the high
resource languages (HRLs) and the low resource languages: 1) Self-evaluated
Competence, evaluating how well the language itself has been learned; and 2)
HRLs-evaluated Competence, evaluating whether an LRL is ready to be learned
according to HRLs' Self-evaluated Competence. Based on the above competencies,
we utilize the proposed CCL-M algorithm to gradually add new languages into the
training set in a curriculum learning manner. Furthermore, we propose a novel
competenceaware dynamic balancing sampling strategy for better selecting
training samples in multilingual training. Experimental results show that our
approach has achieved a steady and significant performance gain compared to the
previous state-of-the-art approach on the TED talks dataset.]]></summary>

reasoning process in a transparent form. Natural language is an attractive
representation for this purpose -- it is both highly expressive and easy for
humans to understand. However, manipulating natural language statements in
logically consistent ways is hard: models must cope with variation in how
meaning is expressed while remaining precise. In this paper, we describe
ParaPattern, a method for building models to generate deductive inferences from
diverse natural language inputs without direct human supervision. We train
BART-based models (Lewis et al., 2020) to generate the result of applying a
particular logical operation to one or more premise statements. Crucially, we
develop a largely automated pipeline for constructing suitable training
examples from Wikipedia. We evaluate our models using out-of-domain sentence
compositions from the QASC (Khot et al., 2020) and EntailmentBank (Dalvi et
al., 2021) datasets as well as targeted perturbation sets. Our results show
that our models are substantially more accurate and flexible than baseline
systems. ParaPattern achieves 85% validity on examples of the 'substitution'
operation from EntailmentBank without the use of any in-domain training data,
matching the performance of a model fine-tuned for EntailmentBank. The full

completion from partially observed samplings. We consider that a tensor is a
superposition of multiple low-rank components. In particular, each component
can be represented as multilinear connections over several latent factors and
naturally mapped to a specific tensor network (TN) topology. In this paper, we
propose a fundamental tensor decomposition (TD) framework: Multi-Tensor Network
Representation (MTNR), which can be regarded as a linear combination of a range
of TD models, e.g., CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition, Tensor Train (TT),
and Tensor Ring (TR). Specifically, MTNR represents a high-order tensor as the
addition of multiple TN models, and the topology of each TN is automatically
generated instead of manually pre-designed. For the optimization phase, an
adaptive topology learning (ATL) algorithm is presented to obtain latent
factors of each TN based on a rank incremental strategy and a projection error
measurement strategy. In addition, we theoretically establish the fundamental
multilinear operations for the tensors with TN representation, and reveal the
structural transformation of MTNR to a single TN. Finally, MTNR is applied to a
typical task, tensor completion, and two effective algorithms are proposed for
the exact recovery of incomplete data based on the Alternating Least Squares
(ALS) scheme and Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM) framework.
Extensive numerical experiments on synthetic data and real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of MTNR compared with the start-of-the-art
methods.]]></summary>

is a growing demand for dialogue summarization. Unfortunately, training a large
summarization model is generally infeasible due to the inadequacy of dialogue
data with annotated summaries. Most existing works for low-resource dialogue
summarization directly pretrain models in other domains, e.g., the news domain,
but they generally neglect the huge difference between dialogues and
conventional articles. To bridge the gap between out-of-domain pretraining and
in-domain fine-tuning, in this work, we propose a multi-source pretraining
paradigm to better leverage the external summary data. Specifically, we exploit
large-scale in-domain non-summary data to separately pretrain the dialogue
encoder and the summary decoder. The combined encoder-decoder model is then
pretrained on the out-of-domain summary data using adversarial critics, aiming
to facilitate domain-agnostic summarization. The experimental results on two
public datasets show that with only limited training data, our approach
achieves competitive performance and generalizes well in different dialogue
scenarios.]]></summary>

retinas, yet a complex computer vision task. Object-motion-sensitive ganglion
cells (OMS-GC) are specialised cells in the retina that sense moving objects.
OMS-GC take as input continuous signals and produce spike patterns as output,
that are transmitted to the Visual Cortex via the optic nerve. The Hybrid
Sensitive Motion Detector (HSMD) algorithm proposed in this work enhances the
GSOC dynamic background subtraction (DBS) algorithm with a customised 3-layer
spiking neural network (SNN) that outputs spiking responses akin to the OMS-GC.
The algorithm was compared against existing background subtraction (BS)
approaches, available on the OpenCV library, specifically on the 2012 change
detection (CDnet2012) and the 2014 change detection (CDnet2014) benchmark
datasets. The results show that the HSMD was ranked overall first among the
competing approaches and has performed better than all the other algorithms on
four of the categories across all the eight test metrics. Furthermore, the HSMD
proposed in this paper is the first to use an SNN to enhance an existing state

as BERT is an emerging trend in recent NLP studies. However, most of the
existing methods combine the external knowledge integration module with a
modified pre-training loss and re-implement the pre-training process on the
large-scale corpus. Re-pretraining these models is usually resource-consuming,
and difficult to adapt to another domain with a different knowledge graph (KG).
Besides, those works either cannot embed knowledge context dynamically
according to textual context or struggle with the knowledge ambiguity issue. In
this paper, we propose a novel knowledge-aware language model framework based
on fine-tuning process, which equips PLM with a unified knowledge-enhanced text
graph that contains both text and multi-relational sub-graphs extracted from
KG. We design a hierarchical relational-graph-based message passing mechanism,
which can allow the representations of injected KG and text to mutually update
each other and can dynamically select ambiguous mentioned entities that share
the same text. Our empirical results show that our model can efficiently
incorporate world knowledge from KGs into existing language models such as

pick up and reproduce all kinds of undesirable biases that can be found in the
data: they often generate racist, sexist, violent or otherwise toxic language.
As large models require millions of training examples to achieve good
performance, it is difficult to completely prevent them from being exposed to
such content. In this paper, we first demonstrate a surprising finding:
pretrained language models recognize, to a considerable degree, their
undesirable biases and the toxicity of the content they produce. We refer to
this capability as self-diagnosis. Based on this finding, we then propose a
decoding algorithm that, given only a textual description of the undesired
behavior, reduces the probability of a language model producing problematic
text. We refer to this approach as self-debiasing. Self-debiasing does not rely
on manually curated word lists, nor does it require any training data or
changes to the model's parameters. While we by no means eliminate the issue of
language models generating biased text, we believe our approach to be an
important step in this direction.]]></summary>

machines as formal grammars, focusing on formal properties that are relevant
for NLP models. We first show that several variants of the counter machine
converge to express the same class of formal languages. We also prove that
counter languages are closed under complement, union, intersection, and many
other common set operations. Next, we show that counter machines cannot
evaluate boolean expressions, even though they can weakly validate their
syntax. This has implications for the interpretability and evaluation of neural
network systems: successfully matching syntactic patterns does not guarantee
that counter memory accurately encodes compositional semantics. Finally, we
consider whether counter languages are semilinear. This work makes general
contributions to the theory of formal languages that are of potential interest
for understanding recurrent neural networks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Code representation learning, which aims to encode the semantics of source
code into distributed vectors, plays an important role in recent
deep-learning-based models for code intelligence. Recently, many pre-trained
language models for source code (e.g., CuBERT and CodeBERT) have been proposed
to model the context of code and serve as a basis for downstream code
intelligence tasks such as code search, code clone detection, and program
translation. Current approaches typically consider the source code as a plain
sequence of tokens, or inject the structure information (e.g., AST and
data-flow) into the sequential model pre-training. To further explore the
properties of programming languages, this paper proposes SynCoBERT, a
syntax-guided multi-modal contrastive pre-training approach for better code
representations. Specially, we design two novel pre-training objectives
originating from the symbolic and syntactic properties of source code, i.e.,
Identifier Prediction (IP) and AST Edge Prediction (TEP), which are designed to
predict identifiers, and edges between two nodes of AST, respectively.
Meanwhile, to exploit the complementary information in semantically equivalent
modalities (i.e., code, comment, AST) of the code, we propose a multi-modal
contrastive learning strategy to maximize the mutual information among
different modalities. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks related to
code intelligence show that SynCoBERT advances the state-of-the-art with the
same pre-training corpus and model size.]]></summary>

MixUp data augmentation framework, we propose a learning algorithm that can
learn from uneven training examples (with zero, one, or multiple labels). This
algorithm efficiently combines signals from uneven training data and brings

steadily improving during recent years. However, these methods are not directly
applicable in preclinical context due to limited datasets and lower image
resolution. Successful application of deep architectures for rat cardiac
segmentation, although of critical importance for preclinical evaluation of
cardiac function, has to our knowledge not yet been reported. We developed
segmentation models that expand on the standard U-Net architecture and
evaluated separate models for systole and diastole phases, 2MSA, and one model
for all timepoints, 1MSA. Furthermore, we calibrated model outputs using a
Gaussian Process (GP)-based prior to improve phase selection. Resulting models
approach human performance in terms of left ventricular segmentation quality
and ejection fraction (EF) estimation in both 1MSA and 2MSA settings
(S{\o}rensen-Dice score 0.91 +/- 0.072 and 0.93 +/- 0.032, respectively). 2MSA
achieved a mean absolute difference between estimated and reference EF of 3.5
+/- 2.5 %, while 1MSA resulted in 4.1 +/- 3.0 %. Applying Gaussian Processes to
1MSA allows to automate the selection of systole and diastole phases. Combined

user utterances would closely follow the system ontology (for NLU or dialogue
state tracking). However, in real-world scenarios, it is highly desirable that
the users can speak freely in their own way. It is extremely hard, if not
impossible, for the users to adapt to the unknown system ontology. In this
work, we attempt to build a user-centric dialogue system. As there is no clean
mapping for a user's free form utterance to an ontology, we first model the
user preferences as estimated distributions over the system ontology and map
the users' utterances to such distributions. Learning such a mapping poses new
challenges on reasoning over existing knowledge, ranging from factoid
knowledge, commonsense knowledge to the users' own situations. To this end, we
build a new dataset named NUANCED that focuses on such realistic settings for
conversational recommendation. Collected via dialogue simulation and
paraphrasing, NUANCED contains 5.1k dialogues, 26k turns of high-quality user
responses. We conduct experiments, showing both the usefulness and challenges
of our problem setting. We believe NUANCED can serve as a valuable resource to
push existing research from the agent-centric system to the user-centric

\textit{separately} pursued under two paradigms: task-oriented dialogue (TOD)
systems, which perform goal-oriented functions, and open-domain dialogue (ODD)
systems, which focus on non-goal-oriented chitchat. The two dialogue modes can
potentially be intertwined together seamlessly in the same conversation, as
easily done by a friendly human assistant. Such ability is desirable in
conversational agents, as the integration makes them more accessible and
useful. Our paper addresses this problem of fusing TODs and ODDs in multi-turn
dialogues. Based on the popular TOD dataset MultiWOZ, we build a new dataset
FusedChat, by rewriting the existing TOD turns and adding new ODD turns. This
procedure constructs conversation sessions containing exchanges from both
dialogue modes. It features inter-mode contextual dependency, i.e., the
dialogue turns from the two modes depend on each other. Rich dependency
patterns including co-reference and ellipsis are features. The new dataset,
with 60k new human-written ODD turns and 5k re-written TOD turns, offers a
benchmark to test a dialogue model's ability to perform inter-mode
conversations. This is a more challenging task since the model has to determine
the appropriate dialogue mode and generate the response based on the inter-mode
context. But such models would better mimic human-level conversation
capabilities. We evaluate baseline models on this task, including
\textit{classification-based} two-stage models and \textit{two-in-one} fused
models. We publicly release FusedChat and the baselines to propel future work
on inter-mode dialogue systems https://github.com/tomyoung903/FusedChat.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Biometric systems are vulnerable to the Presentation Attacks (PA) performed
using various Presentation Attack Instruments (PAIs). Even though there are
numerous Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) techniques based on both deep
learning and hand-crafted features, the generalization of PAD for unknown PAI
is still a challenging problem. The common problem with existing deep
learning-based PAD techniques is that they may struggle with local optima,
resulting in weak generalization against different PAs. In this work, we
propose to use self-supervised learning to find a reasonable initialization
against local trap, so as to improve the generalization ability in detecting
PAs on the biometric system.The proposed method, denoted as IF-OM, is based on
a global-local view coupled with De-Folding and De-Mixing to derive the
task-specific representation for PAD.During De-Folding, the proposed technique
will learn region-specific features to represent samples in a local pattern by
explicitly maximizing cycle consistency. While, De-Mixing drives detectors to
obtain the instance-specific features with global information for more
comprehensive representation by maximizing topological consistency. Extensive
experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve significant
improvements in terms of both face and fingerprint PAD in more complicated and
hybrid datasets, when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Specifically,
when training in CASIA-FASD and Idiap Replay-Attack, the proposed method can
achieve 18.60% Equal Error Rate (EER) in OULU-NPU and MSU-MFSD, exceeding
baseline performance by 9.54%. Code will be made publicly available.]]></summary>

large-scale, high-quality human-annotated labels for fine-tuning or evaluation.
By contrast, in cases of music similarity, such labels are expensive to collect

has demonstrated that embedding calibration technique can greatly increase
semantic similarity performance of the pre-trained language model without

typically assessed against the predictions of existing linguistic theories of
these phenomena. Using the notion of polarity as a case study, we show that
this is not always the most adequate set-up. We probe polarity via so-called
'negative polarity items' (in particular, English 'any') in two pre-trained
Transformer-based models (BERT and GPT-2). We show that -- at least for
polarity -- metrics derived from language models are more consistent with data
from psycholinguistic experiments than linguistic theory predictions.
Establishing this allows us to more adequately evaluate the performance of
language models and also to use language models to discover new insights into
natural language grammar beyond existing linguistic theories. Overall, our
results encourage a closer tie between experiments with human subjects and with
language models. We propose methods to enable this closer tie, with language

inject the language information into the model before predicting the grapheme
sequence. Our experiments show that our proposed approach can obtain
significant improvement over previous approaches [4]. We also show that our

translation and coreference resolution using mostly synthetic diagnostic
datasets. While these quantify bias in a controlled experiment, they often do
so on a small scale and consist mostly of artificial, out-of-distribution

and non-stereotypical gender-role assignments (e.g., female nurses versus male
dancers) in corpora from three domains, resulting in a first large-scale gender
bias dataset of 108K diverse real-world English sentences. We manually verify
the quality of our corpus and use it to evaluate gender bias in various
coreference resolution and machine translation models. We find that all tested
models tend to over-rely on gender stereotypes when presented with natural
inputs, which may be especially harmful when deployed in commercial systems.
Finally, we show that our dataset lends itself to finetuning a coreference
resolution model, finding it mitigates bias on a held out set. Our dataset and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pimentel et al. (2020) recently analysed probing from an
information-theoretic perspective. They argue that probing should be seen as
approximating a mutual information. This led to the rather unintuitive
conclusion that representations encode exactly the same information about a
target task as the original sentences. The mutual information, however, assumes
the true probability distribution of a pair of random variables is known,
leading to unintuitive results in settings where it is not. This paper proposes
a new framework to measure what we term Bayesian mutual information, which
analyses information from the perspective of Bayesian agents -- allowing for
more intuitive findings in scenarios with finite data. For instance, under
Bayesian MI we have that data can add information, processing can help, and
information can hurt, which makes it more intuitive for machine learning
applications. Finally, we apply our framework to probing where we believe
Bayesian mutual information naturally operationalises ease of extraction by
explicitly limiting the available background knowledge to solve a task.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trip recommendation is a significant and engaging location-based service that
can help new tourists make more customized travel plans. It often attempts to
suggest a sequence of point of interests (POIs) for a user who requests a
personalized travel demand. Conventional methods either leverage the heuristic
algorithms (e.g., dynamic programming) or statistical analysis (e.g., Markov
models) to search or rank a POI sequence. These procedures may fail to capture
the diversity of human needs and transitional regularities. They even provide
recommendations that deviate from tourists' real travel intention when the trip
data is sparse. Although recent deep recursive models (e.g., RNN) are capable
of alleviating these concerns, existing solutions hardly recognize the
practical reality, such as the diversity of tourist demands, uncertainties in
the trip generation, and the complex visiting preference. Inspired by the
advance in deep learning, we introduce a novel self-supervised representation
learning framework for trip recommendation -- SelfTrip, aiming at tackling the
aforementioned challenges. Specifically, we propose a two-step contrastive
learning mechanism concerning the POI representation, as well as trip
representation. Furthermore, we present four trip augmentation methods to
capture the visiting uncertainties in trip planning. We evaluate our SelfTrip
on four real-world datasets, and extensive results demonstrate the promising
gain compared with several cutting-edge benchmarks, e.g., up to 4% and 12% on
F1 and pair-F1, respectively.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Practical recommender systems experience a cold-start problem when observed
user-item interactions in the history are insufficient. Meta learning,
especially gradient based one, can be adopted to tackle this problem by
learning initial parameters of the model and thus allowing fast adaptation to a
specific task from limited data examples. Though with significant performance
improvement, it commonly suffers from two critical issues: the
non-compatibility with mainstream industrial deployment and the heavy
computational burdens, both due to the inner-loop gradient operation. These two
issues make them hard to be applied in practical recommender systems. To enjoy
the benefits of meta learning framework and mitigate these problems, we propose
a recommendation framework called Contextual Modulation Meta Learning (CMML).
CMML is composed of fully feed-forward operations so it is computationally
efficient and completely compatible with the mainstream industrial deployment.
CMML consists of three components, including a context encoder that can
generate context embedding to represent a specific task, a hybrid context
generator that aggregates specific user-item features with task-level context,
and a contextual modulation network, which can modulate the recommendation
model to adapt effectively. We validate our approach on both scenario-specific
and user-specific cold-start setting on various real-world datasets, showing
CMML can achieve comparable or even better performance with gradient based
methods yet with much higher computational efficiency and better
interpretability.]]></summary>

benefited from large annotated datasets, the amount of inference-related
knowledge (including commonsense) provided in the annotated data is still
rather limited. There have been two lines of approaches that can be used to
further address the limitation: (1) unsupervised pretraining can leverage
knowledge in much larger unstructured text data; (2) structured (often
human-curated) knowledge has started to be considered in neural-network-based
models for NLI. An immediate question is whether these two approaches
complement each other, or how to develop models that can bring together their
advantages. In this paper, we propose models that leverage structured knowledge
in different components of pre-trained models. Our results show that the
proposed models perform better than previous BERT-based state-of-the-art
models. Although our models are proposed for NLI, they can be easily extended

Neighbor Search (ANNS) problems, which speeds up existing ANNS methods in a
plug-and-play manner. Specifically, we propose a new network structure called
Compression Network with Transformer (CNT) to compress the feature into a low
dimensional space, and an inhomogeneous neighborhood relationship preserving
(INRP) loss that aims to maintain high search accuracy. In CNT, we use multiple
compression projections to cast the feature into many low dimensional spaces,
and then use transformer to globally optimize these projections such that the
features are well compressed following the guidance from our loss function. The
loss function is designed to assign high weights on point pairs that are close
in original feature space, and keep their distances in projected space. Keeping
these distances helps maintain the eventual top-k retrieval accuracy, and down
weighting others creates room for feature compression. In experiments, we run
our compression method on public datasets, and use the compressed features in
graph based, product quantization and scalar quantization based ANNS solutions.
Experimental results show that our compression method can significantly improve
the efficiency of these methods while preserves or even improves search
accuracy, suggesting its broad potential impact on real world applications.]]></summary>

attention patterns to address this problem for summarization. In contrast, this
work focuses on the transformer's encoder-decoder attention mechanism. The cost
of this attention becomes more significant in inference or training approaches
that require model-generated histories. First, we examine the complexity of the
encoder-decoder attention. We demonstrate empirically that there is a sparse
sentence structure in document summarization that can be exploited by
constraining the attention mechanism to a subset of input sentences, whilst
maintaining system performance. Second, we propose a modified architecture that

preferences towards different items. Due to the imbalanced rating distributions
in training data, existing recommendation methods suffer from the biased
prediction problem that generates biased prediction results. Thus, their
performance on predicting ratings which rarely appear in training data is
unsatisfactory. In this paper, inspired by the superior capability of Extreme
Value Distribution (EVD)-based methods in modeling the distribution of rare
data, we propose a novel \underline{\emph{G}}umbel Distribution-based
\underline{\emph{R}}ating \underline{\emph{P}}rediction framework (GRP) which
can accurately predict both frequent and rare ratings between users and items.
In our approach, we first define different Gumbel distributions for each rating
level, which can be learned by historical rating statistics of users and items.
Second, we incorporate the Gumbel-based representations of users and items with
their original representations learned from the rating matrix and/or reviews to
enrich the representations of users and items via a proposed multi-scale
convolutional fusion layer. Third, we propose a data-driven rating prediction
module to predict the ratings of user-item pairs. It's worthy to note that our
approach can be readily applied to existing recommendation methods for
addressing their biased prediction problem. To verify the effectiveness of GRP,
we conduct extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets. Compared with
several baseline models, the results show that: 1) GRP achieves
state-of-the-art overall performance on all eight datasets; 2) GRP makes a
substantial improvement in predicting rare ratings, which shows the
effectiveness of our model in addressing the bias prediction problem.]]></summary>

language pairs with a single model, potentially improving both the accuracy and
the memory-efficiency of deployed models. However, the heavy data imbalance
between languages hinders the model from performing uniformly across language
pairs. In this paper, we propose a new learning objective for MNMT based on
distributionally robust optimization, which minimizes the worst-case expected
loss over the set of language pairs. We further show how to practically
optimize this objective for large translation corpora using an iterated best
response scheme, which is both effective and incurs negligible additional
computational cost compared to standard empirical risk minimization. We perform
extensive experiments on three sets of languages from two datasets and show
that our method consistently outperforms strong baseline methods in terms of

users are interested in, commonly referred to as points of interest (PoI). In
online food delivery platforms, PoIs could represent any major private
compounds where customers could order from such as hospitals, residential
complexes, office complexes, educational institutes and hostels. In this work,
we propose an end-to-end unsupervised system design for obtaining polygon
representations of PoIs (PoI polygons) from address locations and address
texts. We preprocess the address texts using locality names and generate
embeddings for the address texts using a deep learning-based architecture, viz.
RoBERTa, trained on our internal address dataset. The PoI candidates are
identified by jointly clustering the anonymised customer phone GPS locations
(obtained during address onboarding) and the embeddings of the address texts.
The final list of PoI polygons is obtained from these PoI candidates using
novel post-processing steps. This algorithm identified 74.8 % more PoIs than
those obtained using the Mummidi-Krumm baseline algorithm run on our internal
dataset. The proposed algorithm achieves a median area precision of 98 %, a
median area recall of 8 %, and a median F-score of 0.15. In order to improve
the recall of the algorithmic polygons, we post-process them using building
footprint polygons from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) database. The post-processing
algorithm involves reshaping the algorithmic polygon using intersecting
polygons and closed private roads from the OSM database, and accounting for
intersection with public roads on the OSM database. We achieve a median area
recall of 70 %, a median area precision of 69 %, and a median F-score of 0.69
on these post-processed polygons.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Representation learning using network embedding has received tremendous
attention due to its efficacy to solve downstream tasks. Popular embedding
methods (such as deepwalk, node2vec, LINE) are based on a neural architecture,
thus unable to scale on large networks both in terms of time and space usage.
Recently, we proposed BinSketch, a sketching technique for compressing binary
vectors to binary vectors. In this paper, we show how to extend BinSketch and
use it for network hashing. Our proposal named QUINT is built upon BinSketch,
and it embeds nodes of a sparse network onto a low-dimensional space using
simple bi-wise operations. QUINT is the first of its kind that provides
tremendous gain in terms of speed and space usage without compromising much on
the accuracy of the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted to
compare QUINT with seven state-of-the-art network embedding methods for two end
tasks - link prediction and node classification. We observe huge performance
gain for QUINT in terms of speedup (up to 7000x) and space saving (up to 800x)
due to its bit-wise nature to obtain node embedding. Moreover, QUINT is a
consistent top-performer for both the tasks among the baselines across all the
datasets. Our empirical observations are backed by rigorous theoretical
analysis to justify the effectiveness of QUINT. In particular, we prove that
QUINT retains enough structural information which can be used further to
approximate many topological properties of networks with high confidence.]]></summary>

allows heads to efficiently attend to either rows or columns in a table. This
architecture scales linearly with respect to speed and memory, and can handle
documents containing more than 8000 tokens with current accelerators. MATE also
has a more appropriate inductive bias for tabular data, and sets a new

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the prevalence of social media, there has recently been a proliferation
of recommenders that shift their focus from individual modeling to group
recommendation. Since the group preference is a mixture of various
predilections from group members, the fundamental challenge of group
recommendation is to model the correlations among members. Existing methods
mostly adopt heuristic or attention-based preference aggregation strategies to
synthesize group preferences. However, these models mainly focus on the
pairwise connections of users and ignore the complex high-order interactions
within and beyond groups. Besides, group recommendation suffers seriously from
the problem of data sparsity due to severely sparse group-item interactions. In
this paper, we propose a self-supervised hypergraph learning framework for
group recommendation to achieve two goals: (1) capturing the intra- and
inter-group interactions among users; (2) alleviating the data sparsity issue
with the raw data itself. Technically, for (1), a hierarchical hypergraph
convolutional network based on the user- and group-level hypergraphs is
developed to model the complex tuplewise correlations among users within and
beyond groups. For (2), we design a double-scale node dropout strategy to
create self-supervision signals that can regularize user representations with
different granularities against the sparsity issue. The experimental analysis
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed
model and also elucidates the rationality of the hypergraph modeling and the
double-scale self-supervision.]]></summary>

platforms is a much-debated issue. The quantitative state of the art often
overlooks the existence of individual attitudes toward guidance, and eventually
of different categories of users in this regard. Focusing on the case of music
streaming, we analyze the complete listening history of about 9k users over one
year and demonstrate that there is no blanket answer to the intertwinement of
recommendation use and consumption diversity: it depends on users. First we
compute for each user the relative importance of different access modes within
their listening history, introducing a trichotomy distinguishing so-called
`organic' use from algorithmic and editorial guidance. We thereby identify four
categories of users. We then focus on two scales related to content diversity,
both in terms of dispersion -- how much users consume the same content
repeatedly -- and popularity -- how popular is the content they consume. We
show that the two types of recommendation offered by music platforms --
algorithmic and editorial -- may drive the consumption of more or less diverse
content in opposite directions, depending also strongly on the type of users.
Finally, we compare users' streaming histories with the music programming of a
selection of popular French radio stations during the same period. While radio
programs are usually more tilted toward repetition than users' listening
histories, they often program more songs from less popular artists. On the
whole, our results highlight the nontrivial effects of platform-mediated
recommendation on consumption, and lead us to speak of `filter niches' rather
than `filter bubbles'. They hint at further ramifications for the study and
design of recommendation systems.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image translation methods typically aim to manipulate a set of labeled
attributes (given as supervision at training time e.g. domain label) while
leaving the unlabeled attributes intact. Current methods achieve either: (i)
disentanglement, which exhibits low visual fidelity and can only be satisfied
where the attributes are perfectly uncorrelated. (ii) visually-plausible
translations, which are clearly not disentangled. In this work, we propose
OverLORD, a single framework for disentangling labeled and unlabeled attributes
as well as synthesizing high-fidelity images, which is composed of two stages;
(i) Disentanglement: Learning disentangled representations with latent
optimization. Differently from previous approaches, we do not rely on
adversarial training or any architectural biases. (ii) Synthesis: Training
feed-forward encoders for inferring the learned attributes and tuning the
generator in an adversarial manner to increase the perceptual quality. When the
labeled and unlabeled attributes are correlated, we model an additional
representation that accounts for the correlated attributes and improves
disentanglement. We highlight that our flexible framework covers multiple
settings as disentangling labeled attributes, pose and appearance, localized
concepts, and shape and texture. We present significantly better
disentanglement with higher translation quality and greater output diversity
than state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

sequences with a linear attention mechanism. However, it is not compatible with
relative position encoding, which has advantages over absolute position
encoding. In this paper, we discuss possible ways to add relative position
encoding to Performer. Based on the analysis, we propose PermuteFormer, a
Performer-based model with relative position encoding that scales linearly on
long sequences. PermuteFormer applies position-dependent transformation on
queries and keys to encode positional information into the attention module.
This transformation is carefully crafted so that the final output of
self-attention is not affected by absolute positions of tokens. PermuteFormer
introduces negligible computational overhead by design that it runs as fast as
Performer. We evaluate PermuteFormer on Long-Range Arena, a dataset for long

experiments show that PermuteFormer uniformly improves the performance of
Performer with almost no computational overhead and outperforms vanilla
Transformer on most of the tasks.]]></summary>

fine-tuning, which in turn may differ from the test data domain. Our
experiments show that using target domain data during pre-training leads to
large performance improvements across a variety of setups. On a large-scale

reduces the gap between models trained on in-domain and out-of-domain labeled

easier to obtain unlabeled target domain data than labeled data. Moreover, we
find that pre-training on multiple domains improves generalization performance

robots and automated vehicles to navigate in urban environments. As LiDARs
provide accurate illumination-independent geometric depictions of the scene,
performing these tasks using LiDAR point clouds provides reliable predictions.
However, existing datasets lack diversity in the type of urban scenes and have
a limited number of dynamic object instances which hinders both learning of
these tasks as well as credible benchmarking of the developed methods. In this
paper, we introduce the large-scale Panoptic nuScenes benchmark dataset that
extends our popular nuScenes dataset with point-wise groundtruth annotations
for semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and panoptic tracking tasks.
To facilitate comparison, we provide several strong baselines for each of these
tasks on our proposed dataset. Moreover, we analyze the drawbacks of the
existing metrics for the panoptic tracking problem and propose a novel
instance-centric metric that addresses the concerns. We present extensive
experiments that demonstrate the utility of Panoptic nuScenes compared to
existing datasets and make the online evaluation server available at
\url{nuScenes.org}. We believe that this extension will accelerate the research
of novel methods for scene understanding of dynamic urban environments.]]></summary>

user-generated information, e.g., number of downloads and ratings. However, new
apps often have few (or even no) user feedback, suffering from the classic
cold-start problem. How to quickly identify and then recommend new apps of high
quality is a challenging issue. Here, a fundamental requirement is the
capability to accurately measure an app's quality based on its inborn features,
rather than user-generated features. Since users obtain first-hand experience
of an app by interacting with its views, we speculate that the inborn features
are largely related to the visual quality of individual views in an app and the
ways the views switch to one another. In this work, we propose AppQ, a novel
app quality grading and recommendation system that extracts inborn features of
apps based on app source code. In particular, AppQ works in parallel to perform
code analysis to extract app-level features as well as dynamic analysis to
capture view-level layout hierarchy and the switching among views. Each app is
then expressed as an attributed view graph, which is converted into a vector
and fed to classifiers for recognizing its quality classes. Our evaluation with
an app dataset from Google Play reports that AppQ achieves the best performance
with accuracy of 85.0\%. This shows a lot of promise to warm-start app grading
and recommendation systems with AppQ.]]></summary>

learning effective task-specific representations of nodes in graphs. However,
regarding Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN), existing HIN-oriented GCN
methods still suffer from two deficiencies: (1) they cannot flexibly explore
all possible meta-paths and extract the most useful ones for a target object,
which hinders both effectiveness and interpretability; (2) they often need to
generate intermediate meta-path based dense graphs, which leads to high
computational complexity. To address the above issues, we propose an
interpretable and efficient Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (ie-HGCN)
to learn the representations of objects in HINs. It is designed as a
hierarchical aggregation architecture, i.e., object-level aggregation first,
followed by type-level aggregation. The novel architecture can automatically
extract useful meta-paths for each object from all possible meta-paths (within
a length limit), which brings good model interpretability. It can also reduce
the computational cost by avoiding intermediate HIN transformation and
neighborhood attention. We provide theoretical analysis about the proposed
ie-HGCN in terms of evaluating the usefulness of all possible meta-paths, its
connection to the spectral graph convolution on HINs, and its quasi-linear time
complexity. Extensive experiments on three real network datasets demonstrate
the superiority of ie-HGCN over the state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

Our algorithm first runs EigenGame to get an approximation of the principal

subspace is of small dimension in any practical use of EigenGame, this second
step is extremely cheap computationally. Nonetheless, it improves accuracy
significantly for a given computational budget across datasets. In this setup,
the purpose of EigenGame is to narrow down the search space, and prepare the
data for the second step, an exact calculation.

We show formally that pPCA improves upon EigenGame under very mild
conditions, and we provide experimental validation on both synthetic and real
large-scale datasets showing that it systematically translates to improved
performance. In our experiments we achieve improvements in convergence speed by

black-box or simulation-based learning and control problems, where the gradient
of the objective function cannot be easily computed but can be approximated
using the objective function values. Many existing ZO algorithms adopt
two-point feedback schemes due to their fast convergence rate compared to
one-point feedback schemes. However, two-point schemes require two evaluations
of the objective function at each iteration, which can be impractical in
applications where the data are not all available a priori, e.g., in online
optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel one-point feedback scheme that
queries the function value once at each iteration and estimates the gradient
using the residual between two consecutive points. When optimizing a

the proposed one-point residual feedback matches that of ZO with the existing
two-point schemes. Moreover, the query complexity of the proposed algorithm can
be improved when the objective function has Lipschitz gradient. Then, for
stochastic bandit optimization problems where only noisy objective function
values are given, we show that ZO with one-point residual feedback achieves the

business, and other fields. Despite the tremendous accomplishments of machine
learning and deep learning methods, many challenges still remain. In
particular, the performance of machine learning methods is often severely
affected in case of diverse data, usually associated with smaller data sets or
data related to areas of study where the size of the data sets is constrained
by the complexity and/or high cost of experiments. Moreover, data with limited
labeled samples is a challenge to most learning approaches. In this paper, the
aforementioned challenges are addressed by integrating graph-based frameworks,
multiscale structure, modified and adapted optimization procedures and
semi-supervised techniques. This results in two innovative multiscale Laplacian
learning (MLL) approaches for machine learning tasks, such as data
classification, and for tackling diverse data, data with limited samples and
smaller data sets. The first approach, called multikernel manifold learning
(MML), integrates manifold learning with multikernel information and solves a
regularization problem consisting of a loss function and a warped kernel
regularizer using multiscale graph Laplacians. The second approach, called the
multiscale MBO (MMBO) method, introduces multiscale Laplacians to a
modification of the famous classical Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme, and
makes use of fast solvers for finding the approximations to the extremal
eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. We demonstrate the performance of our
methods experimentally on a variety of data sets, such as biological, text and
image data, and compare them favorably to existing approaches.]]></summary>

variety of applications, such as chemometrics, signal processing, and machine
learning. A broadly used method for computing such decompositions relies on the
Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm. When the number of components is
small, regardless of its implementation, ALS exhibits low arithmetic intensity,
which severely hinders its performance and makes GPU offloading ineffective. We
observe that, in practice, experts often have to compute multiple
decompositions of the same tensor, each with a small number of components
(typically fewer than 20), to ultimately find the best ones to use for the
application at hand. In this paper, we illustrate how multiple decompositions
of the same tensor can be fused together at the algorithmic level to increase
the arithmetic intensity. Therefore, it becomes possible to make efficient use
of GPUs for further speedups; at the same time the technique is compatible with
many enhancements typically used in ALS, such as line search, extrapolation,
and non-negativity constraints. We introduce the Concurrent ALS algorithm and
library, which offers an interface to Matlab, and a mechanism to effectively
deal with the issue that decompositions complete at different times.
Experimental results on artificial and real datasets demonstrate a shorter time
to completion due to increased arithmetic intensity.]]></summary>

of GNNs in learning distributed representations from graph-structured data.
However, centralizing a massive amount of real-world graph data for GNN
training is prohibitive due to privacy concerns, regulation restrictions, and
commercial competitions. Federated learning (FL), a trending distributed
learning paradigm, provides possibilities to solve this challenge while
preserving data privacy. Despite recent advances in vision and language
domains, there is no suitable platform for the FL of GNNs. To this end, we
introduce FedGraphNN, an open FL benchmark system that can facilitate research
on federated GNNs. FedGraphNN is built on a unified formulation of graph FL and
contains a wide range of datasets from different domains, popular GNN models,
and FL algorithms, with secure and efficient system support. Particularly for
the datasets, we collect, preprocess, and partition 36 datasets from 7 domains,
including both publicly available ones and specifically obtained ones such as
hERG and Tencent. Our empirical analysis showcases the utility of our benchmark
system, while exposing significant challenges in graph FL: federated GNNs
perform worse in most datasets with a non-IID split than centralized GNNs; the
GNN model that attains the best result in the centralized setting may not
maintain its advantage in the FL setting. These results imply that more
research efforts are needed to unravel the mystery behind federated GNNs.
Moreover, our system performance analysis demonstrates that the FedGraphNN
system is computationally efficient and secure to large-scale graphs datasets.

where the signal plus background regions are not labelled. This strongly
reduces model dependency in the search for signals Beyond the Standard Model.
This approach displays the drawback in that over-fitting can give rise to fake
signals. Tossing toy Monte Carlo (MC) events can be used to estimate the
corresponding trials factor through a frequentist inference. However, MC events
that are based on full detector simulations are resource intensive. Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be used to mimic MC generators. GANs are
powerful generative models, but often suffer from training instability. We
henceforth show a review of GANs. We advocate the use of Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)
with weight clipping and WGAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) where the norm of
gradient of the critic is penalized with respect to its input. Following the
emergence of multi-lepton anomalies at the LHC, we apply GANs for the
generation of di-leptons final states in association with b-quarks at the LHC.
A good agreement between the MC events and the WGAN-GP events is found for the

intrigued the vision community to study their application to computer vision
problems. Among their salient benefits, Transformers enable modeling long
dependencies between input sequence elements and support parallel processing of
sequence as compared to recurrent networks e.g., Long short-term memory (LSTM).
Different from convolutional networks, Transformers require minimal inductive
biases for their design and are naturally suited as set-functions. Furthermore,
the straightforward design of Transformers allows processing multiple
modalities (e.g., images, videos, text and speech) using similar processing
blocks and demonstrates excellent scalability to very large capacity networks
and huge datasets. These strengths have led to exciting progress on a number of
vision tasks using Transformer networks. This survey aims to provide a
comprehensive overview of the Transformer models in the computer vision
discipline. We start with an introduction to fundamental concepts behind the
success of Transformers i.e., self-attention, large-scale pre-training, and
bidirectional encoding. We then cover extensive applications of transformers in
vision including popular recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, object
detection, action recognition, and segmentation), generative modeling,
multi-modal tasks (e.g., visual-question answering, visual reasoning, and
visual grounding), video processing (e.g., activity recognition, video
forecasting), low-level vision (e.g., image super-resolution, image
enhancement, and colorization) and 3D analysis (e.g., point cloud
classification and segmentation). We compare the respective advantages and
limitations of popular techniques both in terms of architectural design and
their experimental value. Finally, we provide an analysis on open research

shared prediction model without centralizing on-device training data. Most of
the current algorithms require comparable individual efforts to train on-device
models with the same structure and size, impeding participation from
resource-constrained devices. Given the widespread yet heterogeneous devices
nowadays, this paper proposes a new framework supporting federated learning
across heterogeneous on-device models via Zero-shot Knowledge Transfer, named
by FedZKT. Specifically, FedZKT allows participating devices to independently
determine their on-device models. To transfer knowledge across on-device
models, FedZKT develops a zero-shot distillation approach contrary to certain
prior research based on a public dataset or a pre-trained data generator. To
utmostly reduce on-device workload, the resource-intensive distillation task is
assigned to the server, which constructs a generator to adversarially train
with the ensemble of the received heterogeneous on-device models. The distilled
central knowledge will then be sent back in the form of the corresponding
on-device model parameters, which can be easily absorbed at the device side.
Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness and the robustness of FedZKT
towards heterogeneous on-device models and challenging federated learning

creates unique verification and validation challenges. In particular, the
continuous engineering paradigm of gradually perfecting a DNN-based perception
can make the previously established result of safety verification no longer
valid. This can occur either due to the newly encountered examples (i.e., input
domain enlargement) inside the Operational Design Domain or due to the
subsequent parameter fine-tuning activities of a DNN. This paper considers
approaches to transfer results established in the previous DNN safety
verification problem to the modified problem setting. By considering the reuse
of state abstractions, network abstractions, and Lipschitz constants, we
develop several sufficient conditions that only require formally analyzing a
small part of the DNN in the new problem. The overall concept is evaluated in a
$1/10$-scaled vehicle that equips a DNN controller to determine the visual
waypoint from the perceived image.]]></summary>

visual classification, recent studies have shown that they are all vulnerable
to the attack of adversarial examples. In this paper, we develop improved
techniques for defending against adversarial examples. First, we propose an
enhanced defense technique denoted Attention and Adversarial Logit
Pairing(AT+ALP), which encourages both attention map and logit for the pairs of
examples to be similar. When being applied to clean examples and their
adversarial counterparts, AT+ALP improves accuracy on adversarial examples over
adversarial training. We show that AT+ALP can effectively increase the average
activations of adversarial examples in the key area and demonstrate that it
focuses on discriminate features to improve the robustness of the model.
Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using a wide range of datasets and
the experiment results show that our AT+ALP achieves the state of the art
defense performance. For example, on 17 Flower Category Database, under strong
200-iteration PGD gray-box and black-box attacks where prior art has 34% and
39% accuracy, our method achieves 50% and 51%. Compared with previous work, our
work is evaluated under highly challenging PGD attack: the maximum perturbation
$\epsilon \in \{0.25,0.5\}$ i.e. $L_\infty \in \{0.25,0.5\}$ with 10 to 200
attack iterations. To the best of our knowledge, such a strong attack has not
been previously explored on a wide range of datasets.]]></summary>

problem in the area of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). The credit
assignment problem, the non-stationarity of the communication environment and
the creation of influenceable agents are major challenges within this research
field which need to be overcome in order to learn a valid communication

Secondly, the non-stationarity of the communication environment while learning
the communication Q-function is overcome by creating the communication
Q-function using the action policy of the other agents and the Q-function of
the action environment. Additionally, a social loss function is introduced in
order to create influenceable agents which is required to learn a valid

of tasks, and as a result, it has become more and more popular and used.
However, as other machine learning algorithms, deep learning, and convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) in particular, perform worse when the data sets present
label noise. Therefore, it is important to develop algorithms that help the
training of deep networks and their generalization to noise-free test sets. In
this paper, we propose a robust training strategy against label noise, called
RAFNI, that can be used with any CNN. This algorithm filters and relabels
instances of the training set based on the predictions and their probabilities
made by the backbone neural network during the training process. That way, this
algorithm improves the generalization ability of the CNN on its own. RAFNI
consists of three mechanisms: two mechanisms that filter instances and one
mechanism that relabels instances. In addition, it does not suppose that the
noise rate is known nor does it need to be estimated. We evaluated our
algorithm using different data sets of several sizes and characteristics. We
also compared it with state-of-the-art models using the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100
benchmarks under different types and rates of label noise and found that RAFNI

neural network for detecting patients suffering from Parkinson's Disease (PD)
based on analyzing the gait cycle is presented. The proposed method utilizes
clinical features extracted from the vertical Ground Reaction Force (vGRF),
measured by 16 wearable sensors placed in the soles of subjects' shoes and
learns interpretable fuzzy rules. Therefore, experts can verify the decision
made by the proposed method based on investigating the firing strength of
interpretable fuzzy rules. Moreover, experts can utilize the extracted fuzzy
rules for patient diagnosing or adjust them based on their knowledge. To
improve the robustness of the proposed method against uncertainty and noisy
sensor measurements, Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic is applied. To learn fuzzy
rules, two paradigms are proposed: 1- A batch learning approach based on
clustering available samples is applied to extract initial fuzzy rules, 2- A
complementary online learning is proposed to improve the rule base encountering
new labeled samples. The performance of the method is evaluated for classifying
patients and healthy subjects in different conditions including the presence of
noise or observing new instances. Moreover, the performance of the model is
compared to some previous supervised and unsupervised machine learning
approaches. The final Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score of the proposed

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep AUC Maximization (DAM) is a new paradigm for learning a deep neural
network by maximizing the AUC score of the model on a dataset. Most previous
works of AUC maximization focus on the perspective of optimization by designing
efficient stochastic algorithms, and studies on generalization performance of
large-scale DAM on difficult tasks are missing. In this work, we aim to make
DAM more practical for interesting real-world applications (e.g., medical image
classification). First, we propose a new margin-based min-max surrogate loss
function for the AUC score (named as AUC min-max-margin loss or simply AUC
margin loss for short). It is more robust than the commonly used AUC square
loss, while enjoying the same advantage in terms of large-scale stochastic
optimization. Second, we conduct extensive empirical studies of our DAM method
on four difficult medical image classification tasks, namely (i) classification
of chest x-ray images for identifying many threatening diseases, (ii)
classification of images of skin lesions for identifying melanoma, (iii)
classification of mammogram for breast cancer screening, and (iv)
classification of microscopic images for identifying tumor tissue. Our studies
demonstrate that the proposed DAM method improves the performance of optimizing
cross-entropy loss by a large margin, and also achieves better performance than
optimizing the existing AUC square loss on these medical image classification
tasks. Specifically, our DAM method has achieved the 1st place on Stanford
CheXpert competition on Aug. 31, 2020. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work that makes DAM succeed on large-scale medical image datasets. We
also conduct extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the advantages of the
new AUC margin loss over the AUC square loss on benchmark datasets. The
proposed method is implemented in our open-sourced library LibAUC
(www.libauc.org).]]></summary>

on a key assumption, i.e., the power system can be accurately modeled. However,
the transmission line parameters are dynamic and cannot be accurately known
during operation and thus the involved modeling errors should not be neglected.
In this paper, an illustrative case has revealed that modeling errors in
transmission lines significantly weaken the detection effectiveness of
conventional FDIA approaches. To tackle this issue, we propose an FDIA
detection mechanism from the perspective of transfer learning. Specifically,
the simulated power system is treated as a source domain, which provides
abundant simulated normal and attack data. The real world's running system
whose transmission line parameters are unknown is taken as a target domain
where sufficient real normal data are collected for tracking the latest system
states online. The designed transfer strategy that aims at making full use of
data in hand is divided into two optimization stages. In the first stage, a
deep neural network (DNN) is built by simultaneously optimizing several
well-designed objective terms with both simulated data and real data, and then
it is fine-tuned via real data in the second stage. Several case studies on the
IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus systems verify the effectiveness of the proposed
mechanism.]]></summary>

relational table tasks, like data search, with models trained on large table
corpora. Existing corpora primarily contain tables extracted from HTML pages,
limiting the capability to represent offline database tables. To train and
evaluate high-capacity models for applications beyond the Web, we need
additional resources with tables that resemble relational database tables.

Here we introduce GitTables, a corpus of currently 1.7M relational tables
extracted from GitHub. Our continuing curation aims at growing the corpus to at
least 20M tables. We annotate table columns in GitTables with more than 2K
different semantic types from Schema.org and DBpedia. Our column annotations
consist of semantic types, hierarchical relations, range types and
descriptions.

The corpus is available at https://gittables.github.io. Our analysis of
GitTables shows that its structure, content, and topical coverage differ
significantly from existing table corpora. We evaluate our annotation pipeline
on hand-labeled tables from the T2Dv2 benchmark and find that our approach
provides results on par with human annotations. We demonstrate a use case of
GitTables by training a semantic type detection model on it and obtain high
prediction accuracy. We also show that the same model trained on tables from

image-based plant disease diagnosis. The construction of large and publicly
available datasets containing labeled images of healthy and diseased crop
plants led to growing interest in computer vision techniques for automatic
plant disease diagnosis. Although supervised image classifiers based on deep
learning can be a powerful tool for plant disease diagnosis, they require a
huge amount of labeled data. The data mining technique of anomaly detection
includes unsupervised approaches that do not require rare samples for training
classifiers. We propose an unsupervised anomaly detection technique for
image-based plant disease diagnosis that is based on the reconstructability of
colors; a deep encoder-decoder network trained to reconstruct the colors of
\textit{healthy} plant images should fail to reconstruct colors of symptomatic
regions. Our proposed method includes a new image-based framework for plant
disease detection that utilizes a conditional adversarial network called
pix2pix and a new anomaly score based on CIEDE2000 color difference.
Experiments with PlantVillage dataset demonstrated the superiority of our
proposed method compared to an existing anomaly detector at identifying
diseased crop images in terms of accuracy, interpretability and computational
efficiency.]]></summary>

are in inherent opposition to one another, 2) strict notions of mathematical

accuracy and fairness of decisions independent from historical context, and 4)
collecting more data on marginalized individuals is a reasonable solution to
mitigate the effects of the trade-off. We argue that such assumptions, which
are often left implicit and unexamined, lead to inconsistent conclusions: While
the intended goal of this work may be to improve the fairness of machine

minibatch size in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can improve test set
performance. We argue this is expected under some conditions in models with a
loss function with multiple local minima. Our main contribution is an
approximate but analytical approach inspired by methods in Physics to study the
role of the SGD learning rate and batch size in generalization. We characterize
test set performance under a shift between the training and test data
distributions for loss functions with multiple minima. The shift can simply be
due to sampling, and is therefore typically present in practical applications.
We show that the resulting shift in local minima worsens test performance by
picking up curvature, implying that generalization improves by selecting wide
and/or little-shifted local minima. We then specialize to SGD, and study its
test performance under stationarity. Because obtaining the exact stationary
distribution of SGD is intractable, we derive a Fokker-Planck approximation of
SGD and obtain its stationary distribution instead. This process shows that the
learning rate divided by the minibatch size plays a role analogous to
temperature in statistical mechanics, and implies that SGD, including its
stationary distribution, is largely invariant to changes in learning rate or
batch size that leave its temperature constant. We show that increasing SGD
temperature encourages the selection of local minima with lower curvature, and
can enable better generalization. We provide experiments on CIFAR10
demonstrating the temperature invariance of SGD, improvement of the test loss
as SGD temperature increases, and quantifying the impact of sampling versus
domain shift in driving this effect. Finally, we present synthetic experiments
showing how our theory applies in a simplified loss with two local minima.]]></summary>

often approached by describing various desiderata associated with learned

It can be challenging, however, to turn these intuitive desiderata into formal
criteria that can be measured and enhanced based on observed data. In this
paper, we take a causal perspective on representation learning, formalizing
non-spuriousness and efficiency (in supervised representation learning) and
disentanglement (in unsupervised representation learning) using counterfactual

computable metrics that can be used to assess the degree to which

critical direction in the computer vision field. However, realistic benchmarks

an ego-centric video stream collected over nine months by a graduate student.
OAK provides exhaustive bounding box annotations of 80 video snippets (~17.5

categories in our benchmark follows a pattern similar to what a single person
might see in their day-to-day life. The dataset also captures the natural
distribution shifts as the person travels to different places. These egocentric
long-running videos provide a realistic playground for continual learning
algorithms, especially in online embodied settings. We also introduce new
evaluation metrics to evaluate the model performance and catastrophic

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often outperform
conventional alternatives for denoising positron emission tomography (PET)
images, they require many low- and high-quality reference PET image pairs.
Herein, we propose an unsupervised 3D PET image denoising method based on an
anatomical information-guided attention mechanism. The proposed magnetic
resonance-guided deep decoder (MR-GDD) utilizes the spatial details and
semantic features of MR-guidance image more effectively by introducing
encoder-decoder and deep decoder subnetworks. Moreover, the specific shapes and
patterns of the guidance image do not affect the denoised PET image, because
the guidance image is input to the network through an attention gate. In a
Monte Carlo simulation of [$^{18}$F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), the
proposed method achieved the highest peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural
similarity (27.92 $\pm$ 0.44 dB/0.886 $\pm$ 0.007), as compared with Gaussian
filtering (26.68 $\pm$ 0.10 dB/0.807 $\pm$ 0.004), image guided filtering
(27.40 $\pm$ 0.11 dB/0.849 $\pm$ 0.003), deep image prior (DIP) (24.22 $\pm$
0.43 dB/0.737 $\pm$ 0.017), and MR-DIP (27.65 $\pm$ 0.42 dB/0.879 $\pm$ 0.007).
Furthermore, we experimentally visualized the behavior of the optimization
process, which is often unknown in unsupervised CNN-based restoration problems.
For preclinical (using [$^{18}$F]FDG and [$^{11}$C]raclopride) and clinical
(using [$^{18}$F]florbetapir) studies, the proposed method demonstrates
state-of-the-art denoising performance while retaining spatial resolution and
quantitative accuracy, despite using a common network architecture for various
noisy PET images with 1/10th of the full counts. These results suggest that the
proposed MR-GDD can reduce PET scan times and PET tracer doses considerably
without impacting patients.]]></summary>

how they learn the task and what it means in terms of understanding human

saliency models from their corresponding deep neural architecture based
saliency models by applying human perception theories and the conventional
concepts of saliency. This technique helps us understand the learning pattern
of the deep network at its intermediate layers through their activation maps.
Initially, we consider two state-of-the-art deep saliency models, namely UNISAL
and MSI-Net for our interpretation. We use a set of biologically plausible
log-gabor filters for identifying and reconstructing the activation maps of
them using our explainable saliency model. The final saliency map is generated
using these reconstructed activation maps. We also build our own deep saliency
model named cross-concatenated multi-scale residual block based network
(CMRNet) for saliency prediction. Then, we evaluate and compare the performance
of the explainable models derived from UNISAL, MSI-Net and CMRNet on three
benchmark datasets with other state-of-the-art methods. Hence, we propose that
this approach of explainability can be applied to any deep visual saliency

non-parametric learning. However, existing implementations of KRR require that
all the data is stored in the main memory, which severely limits the use of KRR
in contexts where data size far exceeds the memory size. Such applications are
increasingly common in data mining, bioinformatics, and control. A powerful
paradigm for computing on data sets that are too large for memory is the
streaming model of computation, where we process one data sample at a time,
discarding each sample before moving on to the next one. In this paper, we
propose StreaMRAK - a streaming version of KRR. StreaMRAK improves on existing
KRR schemes by dividing the problem into several levels of resolution, which
allows continual refinement to the predictions. The algorithm reduces the
memory requirement by continuously and efficiently integrating new samples into
the training model. With a novel sub-sampling scheme, StreaMRAK reduces memory
and computational complexities by creating a sketch of the original data, where
the sub-sampling density is adapted to the bandwidth of the kernel and the
local dimensionality of the data. We present a showcase study on two synthetic
problems and the prediction of the trajectory of a double pendulum. The results
show that the proposed algorithm is fast and accurate.]]></summary>

generating random hashes to approximate the Jaccard (resemblance) similarity in
massive binary (0/1) data. The basic theory of MinHash requires applying
hundreds or even thousands of independent random permutations to each data
vector in the dataset, in order to obtain reliable results for (e.g.,) building
large-scale learning models or approximate near neighbor search in massive
data. In this paper, we propose {\bf Circulant MinHash (C-MinHash)} and provide
the surprising theoretical results that we just need \textbf{two} independent
random permutations. For C-MinHash, we first conduct an initial permutation on
the data vector, then we use a second permutation to generate hash values.
Basically, the second permutation is re-used $K$ times via circulant shifting
to produce $K$ hashes. Unlike classical MinHash, these $K$ hashes are obviously
correlated, but we are able to provide rigorous proofs that we still obtain an
unbiased estimate of the Jaccard similarity and the theoretical variance is
uniformly smaller than that of the classical MinHash with $K$ independent
permutations. The theoretical proofs of C-MinHash require some non-trivial
efforts. Numerical experiments are conducted to justify the theory and

it is vital to empirically evaluate and compare them on well-curated benchmark
suites. In this work, we list desirable properties and requirements for such
benchmarks and propose a new set of challenging and relevant multifidelity HPO
benchmark problems motivated by these requirements. For this, we revisit the
concept of surrogate-based benchmarks and empirically compare them to more
widely-used tabular benchmarks, showing that the latter ones may induce bias in
performance estimation and ranking of HPO methods. We present a new
surrogate-based benchmark suite for multifidelity HPO methods consisting of 9
benchmark collections that constitute over 700 multifidelity HPO problems in
total. All our benchmarks also allow for querying of multiple optimization
targets, enabling the benchmarking of multi-objective HPO. We examine and
compare our benchmark suite with respect to the defined requirements and show
that our benchmarks provide viable additions to existing suites.]]></summary>

performance in several tasks, such as image classification and natural language

systems are used in various applications that involve security threats from
physical adversarial examples. Herein, we propose a physical adversarial attack
with the use of full-face makeup. The presence of makeup on the human face is a
reasonable possibility, which possibly increases the imperceptibility of
attacks. In our attack framework, we combine the cycle-adversarial generative
network (cycle-GAN) and a victimized classifier. The Cycle-GAN is used to
generate adversarial makeup, and the architecture of the victimized classifier
is VGG 16. Our experimental results show that our attack can effectively
overcome manual errors in makeup application, such as color and
position-related errors. We also demonstrate that the approaches used to train
the models can influence physical attacks; the adversarial perturbations
crafted from the pre-trained model are affected by the corresponding training

the conventional pooled global feature is likely to lose useful local
characteristics. Recent work has achieved promising performances by using deep
descriptors. They generally take all deep descriptors from neural networks into
consideration while ignoring that some of them are useless in classification
due to their limited receptive field, e.g., task-irrelevant descriptors could
be misleading and multiple aggregative descriptors from background clutter
could even overwhelm the object's presence. In this paper, we argue that a
Mutual Nearest Neighbor (MNN) relation should be established to explicitly
select the query descriptors that are most relevant to each task and discard
less relevant ones from aggregative clutters in FSL. Specifically, we propose
Discriminative Mutual Nearest Neighbor Neural Network (DMN4) for FSL. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing

Thakurta [EFMRTT19] demonstrates that random shuffling amplifies differential
privacy guarantees of locally randomized data. Such amplification implies
substantially stronger privacy guarantees for systems in which data is
contributed anonymously [BEMMRLRKTS17] and has lead to significant interest in
the shuffle model of privacy [CSUZZ19; EFMRTT19].

We show that random shuffling of $n$ data records that are input to
$\varepsilon_0$-differentially private local randomizers results in an
$(O((1-e^{-\varepsilon_0})\sqrt{\frac{e^{\varepsilon_0}\log(1/\delta)}{n}}),
\delta)$-differentially private algorithm. This significantly improves over
previous work and achieves the asymptotically optimal dependence in
$\varepsilon_0$. Our result is based on a new approach that is simpler than
previous work and extends to approximate differential privacy with nearly the
same guarantees. Importantly, our work also yields an algorithm for deriving
tighter bounds on the resulting $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ as well as R\'enyi
differential privacy guarantees. We show numerically that our algorithm gets to
within a small constant factor of the optimal bound. As a direct corollary of
our analysis we derive a simple and nearly optimal algorithm for frequency
estimation in the shuffle model of privacy. We also observe that our result
implies the first asymptotically optimal privacy analysis of noisy stochastic
gradient descent that applies to sampling without replacement.]]></summary>

build personalization model. However, the collected data is observational
rather than experimental, causing various biases in the data which
significantly affect the learned model. Most existing work for recommendation
debiasing, such as the inverse propensity scoring and imputation approaches,
focuses on one or two specific biases, lacking the universal capacity that can
account for mixed or even unknown biases in the data. Towards this research
gap, we first analyze the origin of biases from the perspective of \textit{risk
discrepancy} that represents the difference between the expectation empirical
risk and the true risk. Remarkably, we derive a general learning framework that
well summarizes most existing debiasing strategies by specifying some
parameters of the general framework. This provides a valuable opportunity to
develop a universal solution for debiasing, e.g., by learning the debiasing
parameters from data. However, the training data lacks important signal of how
the data is biased and what the unbiased data looks like. To move this idea
forward, we propose \textit{AotoDebias} that leverages another (small) set of
uniform data to optimize the debiasing parameters by solving the bi-level
optimization problem with meta-learning. Through theoretical analyses, we
derive the generalization bound for AutoDebias and prove its ability to acquire
the appropriate debiasing strategy. Extensive experiments on two real datasets
and a simulated dataset demonstrated effectiveness of AutoDebias. The code is

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Choroid plexuses (CP) are structures of the ventricles of the brain which
produce most of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Several postmortem and in vivo
studies have pointed towards their role in the inflammatory process in multiple
sclerosis (MS). Automatic segmentation of CP from MRI thus has high value for
studying their characteristics in large cohorts of patients. To the best of our
knowledge, the only freely available tool for CP segmentation is FreeSurfer but
its accuracy for this specific structure is poor. In this paper, we propose to
automatically segment CP from non-contrast enhanced T1-weighted MRI. To that
end, we introduce a new model called "Axial-MLP" based on an assembly of Axial
multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). This is inspired by recent works which showed
that the self-attention layers of Transformers can be replaced with MLPs. This
approach is systematically compared with a standard 3D U-Net, nnU-Net,
Freesurfer and FastSurfer. For our experiments, we make use of a dataset of 141
subjects (44 controls and 97 patients with MS). We show that all the tested
deep learning (DL) methods outperform FreeSurfer (Dice around 0.7 for DL vs
0.33 for FreeSurfer). Axial-MLP is competitive with U-Nets even though it is
slightly less accurate. The conclusions of our paper are two-fold: 1) the
studied deep learning methods could be useful tools to study CP in large
cohorts of MS patients; 2)~Axial-MLP is a potentially viable alternative to
convolutional neural networks for such tasks, although it could benefit from
further improvements.]]></summary>

environments, interact with each other, and control production processes.
Smooth operation of such factories requires that the machines and engineering

Creation and maintenance of such knowledge is expensive and requires
automation. In this work we show how machine learning that is specifically
tailored towards industrial applications can help in knowledge graph

methods with data assimilation to reconstruct a dynamical system using only
sparse and noisy observations of that system. The same approach can be used to
correct the error of a knowledge-based model. The resulting surrogate model is
hybrid, with a statistical part supplementing a physical part. In practice, the
correction can be added as an integrated term (i.e. in the model resolvent) or
directly inside the tendencies of the physical model. The resolvent correction
is easy to implement. The tendency correction is more technical, in particular
it requires the adjoint of the physical model, but also more flexible. We use
the two-scale Lorenz model to compare the two methods. The accuracy in
long-range forecast experiments is somewhat similar between the surrogate
models using the resolvent correction and the tendency correction. By contrast,
the surrogate models using the tendency correction significantly outperform the
surrogate models using the resolvent correction in data assimilation
experiments. Finally, we show that the tendency correction opens the
possibility to make online model error correction, i.e. improving the model
progressively as new observations become available. The resulting algorithm can
be seen as a new formulation of weak-constraint 4D-Var. We compare online and
offline learning using the same framework with the two-scale Lorenz system, and
show that with online learning, it is possible to extract all the information
from sparse and noisy observations.]]></summary>

Vehicles. It supports different types of services with different resource and
service requirements. However, limited resources at the edge, high mobility of
vehicles, increasing demand, and dynamicity in service request-types have made
service placement a challenging task. A typical static placement solution is
not effective as it does not consider the traffic mobility and service
dynamics. Handling dynamics in IoV for service placement is an important and
challenging problem which is the primary focus of our work in this paper. We
propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Dynamic Service Placement (DRLD-SP)
framework with the objective of minimizing the maximum edge resource usage and
service delay while considering the vehicle's mobility, varying demand, and
dynamics in the requests for different types of services. We use SUMO and
MATLAB to carry out simulation experiments. The experimental results show that
the proposed DRLD-SP approach is effective and outperforms other static and
dynamic placement approaches.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The bias-variance trade-off is a central concept in supervised learning. In
classical statistics, increasing the complexity of a model (e.g., number of
parameters) reduces bias but also increases variance. Until recently, it was
commonly believed that optimal performance is achieved at intermediate model
complexities which strike a balance between bias and variance. Modern Deep
Learning methods flout this dogma, achieving state-of-the-art performance using
"over-parameterized models" where the number of fit parameters is large enough
to perfectly fit the training data. As a result, understanding bias and
variance in over-parameterized models has emerged as a fundamental problem in
machine learning. Here, we use methods from statistical physics to derive
analytic expressions for bias and variance in two minimal models of
over-parameterization (linear regression and two-layer neural networks with
nonlinear data distributions), allowing us to disentangle properties stemming
from the model architecture and random sampling of data. In both models,
increasing the number of fit parameters leads to a phase transition where the
training error goes to zero and the test error diverges as a result of the
variance (while the bias remains finite). Beyond this threshold in the
interpolation regime, the training error remains zero while the test error
decreases. We also show that in contrast with classical intuition,
over-parameterized models can overfit even in the absence of noise and exhibit
bias even if the student and teacher models match. We synthesize these results
to construct a holistic understanding of generalization error and the
bias-variance trade-off in over-parameterized models and relate our results to
random matrix theory.]]></summary>

(POIs) from a large number of candidate POIs in a city. In this paper, we

These alternative itineraries would be not only popular given the historical
routes adopted by past users but also dissimilar (or diverse) to each other.
The DeepAltTrip consists of two major components: (i) Itinerary Net (ITRNet)
which estimates the likelihood of POIs on an itinerary by using graph
autoencoders and two (forward and backward) LSTMs; and (ii) a route generation
procedure to generate k diverse itineraries passing through relevant POIs
obtained using ITRNet. For the route generation step, we propose a novel
sampling algorithm that can seamlessly handle a wide variety of user-defined
constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that learns
from historical trips to provide a set of alternative itineraries to the users.
Extensive experiments conducted on eight popular real-world datasets show the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Contrastive Learning (CL) is one of the most popular self-supervised learning
frameworks for graph representation learning, which trains a Graph Neural
Network (GNN) by discriminating positive and negative node pairs. However,
there are two challenges for CL on graphs. On the one hand, traditional CL
methods will unavoidably introduce semantic errors since they will treat some
semantically similar nodes as negative pairs. On the other hand, most of the
existing CL methods ignore the multiplexity nature of the real-world graphs,
where nodes are connected by various relations and each relation represents a
view of the graph. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Graph
Multi-View Prototypical (Graph-MVP) framework to extract node embeddings on
multiplex graphs. Firstly, we introduce a Graph Prototypical Contrastive
Learning (Graph-PCL) framework to capture both node-level and semantic-level
information for each view of multiplex graphs. Graph-PCL captures the
node-level information by a simple yet effective data transformation technique.
It captures the semantic-level information by an Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm, which alternatively performs clustering over node embeddings and
parameter updating for GNN. Next, we introduce Graph-MVP based on Graph-PCL to
jointly model different views of the multiplex graphs. Our key insight behind
Graph-MVP is that different view-specific embeddings of the same node should
have similar underlying semantic, based on which we propose two versions of
Graph-MVP: Graph-MVP_hard and Graph-MVP_soft to align embeddings across views.
Finally, we evaluate the proposed Graph-PCL and Graph-MVP on a variety of
real-world datasets and downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed Graph-PCL and Graph-MVP frameworks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The emergence of Industry 4.0 is making production systems more flexible and
also more dynamic. In these settings, schedules often need to be adapted in
real-time by dispatching rules. Although substantial progress was made until
the '90s, the performance of these rules is still rather limited. The machine
learning literature is developing a variety of methods to improve them, but the
resulting rules are difficult to interpret and do not generalise well for a
wide range of settings. This paper is the first major attempt at combining
machine learning with domain problem reasoning for scheduling. The idea
consists of using the insights obtained with the latter to guide the empirical
search of the former. Our hypothesis is that this guided empirical learning
process should result in dispatching rules that are effective and interpretable
and which generalise well to different instance classes. We test our approach

which is one of the most well-studied scheduling problems. Nonetheless, results
suggest that our approach was able to find new state-of-the-art rules, which
significantly outperform the existing literature in the vast majority of
settings, from loose to tight due dates and from low utilisation conditions to
congested shops. Overall, the average improvement is 19%. Moreover, the rules
are compact, interpretable, and generalise well to extreme, unseen scenarios.]]></summary>

whether QML on classical datasets will achieve such an advantage. In this work,
we argue that one should instead employ quantum datasets composed of quantum

show how a quantum neural network can be trained to generate the states in the
NTangled dataset. Then, we use the NTangled dataset to benchmark QML models for
supervised learning classification tasks. We also consider an alternative

prepared by quantum circuits with different depths. As a byproduct of our

Manipulation Skill Benchmark (ManiSkill) to benchmark manipulation skills over
diverse objects in a full-physics simulator. 3D assets in ManiSkill include
large intra-class topological and geometric variations. Tasks are carefully

large model (teacher) to a small model (student), has become an important area
of research for practical deployment of recommender systems. Recently, Relaxed
Ranking Distillation (RRD) has shown that distilling the ranking information in
the recommendation list significantly improves the performance. However, the
method still has limitations in that 1) it does not fully utilize the
prediction errors of the student model, which makes the training not fully
efficient, and 2) it only distills the user-side ranking information, which
provides an insufficient view under the sparse implicit feedback. This paper
presents Dual Correction strategy for Distillation (DCD), which transfers the
ranking information from the teacher model to the student model in a more
efficient manner. Most importantly, DCD uses the discrepancy between the
teacher model and the student model predictions to decide which knowledge to be
distilled. By doing so, DCD essentially provides the learning guidance tailored
to "correcting" what the student model has failed to accurately predict. This
process is applied for transferring the ranking information from the user-side
as well as the item-side to address sparse implicit user feedback. Our
experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art
baselines, and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component.]]></summary>

it is of paramount importance to learn a policy that maximizes the reward while
avoiding potentially dangerous actions when there is uncertainty. There are two
main challenges usually associated with this problem. Firstly, learning through
online exploration is not possible due to the critical nature of such
applications. Therefore, we need to resort to observational datasets with no
counterfactuals. Secondly, such datasets are usually imperfect, additionally
cursed with missing values in the attributes of features. In this paper, we
consider the problem of constructing personalized policies using logged data
when there are missing values in the attributes of features in both training
and test data. The goal is to recommend an action (treatment) when $\Xt$, a
degraded version of $\Xb$ with missing values, is observed. We consider three
strategies for dealing with missingness. In particular, we introduce the
\textit{conservative strategy} where the policy is designed to safely handle
the uncertainty due to missingness. In order to implement this strategy we need
to estimate posterior distribution $p(\Xb|\Xt)$, we use variational autoencoder
to achieve this. In particular, our method is based on partial variational
autoencoders (PVAE) which are designed to capture the underlying structure of
features with missing values.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, the problem of minimizing the weighted sum of age of
information (AoI) and total energy consumption of Internet of Things (IoT)
devices is studied. In the considered model, each IoT device monitors a
physical process that follows nonlinear dynamics. As the dynamics of the
physical process vary over time, each device must find an optimal sampling
frequency to sample the real-time dynamics of the physical system and send
sampled information to a base station (BS). Due to limited wireless resources,
the BS can only select a subset of devices to transmit their sampled
information. Thus, edge devices must cooperatively sample their monitored
dynamics based on the local observations and the BS must collect the sampled
information from the devices immediately, hence avoiding the additional time
and energy used for sampling and information transmission. To this end, it is
necessary to jointly optimize the sampling policy of each device and the device
selection scheme of the BS so as to accurately monitor the dynamics of the
physical process using minimum energy. This problem is formulated as an
optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the weighted sum of AoI cost and
energy consumption. To solve this problem, we propose a novel distributed
reinforcement learning (RL) approach for the sampling policy optimization. The
proposed algorithm enables edge devices to cooperatively find the global
optimal sampling policy using their own local observations. Given the sampling
policy, the device selection scheme can be optimized thus minimizing the
weighted sum of AoI and energy consumption of all devices. Simulations with
real data of PM 2.5 pollution show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the
sum of AoI by up to 17.8% and 33.9% and the total energy consumption by up to
13.2% and 35.1%, compared to a conventional deep Q network method and a uniform
sampling policy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Computer vision has witnessed several advances in recent years, with
unprecedented performance provided by deep representation learning research.
Image formats thus appear attractive to other fields such as malware detection,
where deep learning on images alleviates the need for comprehensively
hand-crafted features generalising to different malware variants. We postulate
that this research direction could become the next frontier in Android malware
detection, and therefore requires a clear roadmap to ensure that new approaches
indeed bring novel contributions. We contribute with a first building block by
developing and assessing a baseline pipeline for image-based malware detection
with straightforward steps. We propose DexRay, which converts the bytecode of
the app DEX files into grey-scale "vector" images and feeds them to a
1-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network model. We view DexRay as
foundational due to the exceedingly basic nature of the design choices,
allowing to infer what could be a minimal performance that can be obtained with
image-based learning in malware detection. The performance of DexRay evaluated
on over 158k apps demonstrates that, while simple, our approach is effective
with a high detection rate(F1-score= 0.96). Finally, we investigate the impact
of time decay and image-resizing on the performance of DexRay and assess its
resilience to obfuscation. This work-in-progress paper contributes to the
domain of Deep Learning based Malware detection by providing a sound, simple,
yet effective approach (with available artefacts) that can be the basis to
scope the many profound questions that will need to be investigated to fully
develop this domain.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federated learning has emerged as a popular technique for distributing model
training across the network edge. Its learning architecture is conventionally a
star topology between the devices and a central server. In this paper, we
propose two timescale hybrid federated learning (TT-HF), which migrates to a
more distributed topology via device-to-device (D2D) communications. In TT-HF,
local model training occurs at devices via successive gradient iterations, and
the synchronization process occurs at two timescales: (i) macro-scale, where
global aggregations are carried out via device-server interactions, and (ii)
micro-scale, where local aggregations are carried out via D2D cooperative
consensus formation in different device clusters. Our theoretical analysis
reveals how device, cluster, and network-level parameters affect the
convergence of TT-HF, and leads to a set of conditions under which a
convergence rate of O(1/t) is guaranteed. Experimental results demonstrate the
improvements in convergence and utilization that can be obtained by TT-HF over
state-of-the-art federated learning baselines.]]></summary>

approximators such as neural networks has been found to lead to overestimation

primitive environments. In this paper, we show that the failure of some cases
can be attributed to insufficient exploration. We reveal the culprit of
insufficient exploration in TD3, and propose a novel algorithm toward this
problem that ADapts between Exploration and Robustness, namely ADER. To enhance
the exploration ability while eliminating the overestimation bias, we introduce
a dynamic penalty term in value estimation calculated from estimated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Wasserstein barycenter has been widely studied in various fields,
including natural language processing, and computer vision. However, it
requires a high computational cost to solve the Wasserstein barycenter problem
because the computation of the Wasserstein distance requires a quadratic time
with respect to the number of supports. By contrast, the Wasserstein distance
on a tree, called the tree-Wasserstein distance, can be computed in linear time
and allows for the fast comparison of a large number of distributions. In this
study, we propose a barycenter under the tree-Wasserstein distance, called the
fixed support tree-Wasserstein barycenter (FS-TWB) and its extension, called
the fixed support tree-sliced Wasserstein barycenter (FS-TSWB). More
specifically, we first show that the FS-TWB and FS-TSWB problems are convex
optimization problems and can be solved by using the projected subgradient
descent. Moreover, we propose a more efficient algorithm to compute the
subgradient and objective function value by using the properties of
tree-Wasserstein barycenter problems. Through real-world experiments, we show
that, by using the proposed algorithm, the FS-TWB and FS-TSWB can be solved two
orders of magnitude faster than the original Wasserstein barycenter.]]></summary>

utilises two attention models: word attention to draw different sub-regions

non-linear interaction among channels. With spectral normalisation to stabilise
training, our proposed CAGAN improves the state of the art on the IS and FID on
the CUB dataset and the FID on the more challenging COCO dataset. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that judging a model by a single evaluation metric can be
misleading by developing an additional model adding local self-attention which
scores a higher IS, outperforming the state of the art on the CUB dataset, but
generates unrealistic images through feature repetition.]]></summary>

applications that need material decomposition. Image-domain methods directly
decompose material images from high- and low-energy attenuation images, and
thus, are susceptible to noise and artifacts on attenuation images. The purpose
of this study is to develop an improved iterative neural network (INN) for
high-quality image-domain material decomposition in DECT, and to study its
properties. We propose a new INN architecture for DECT material decomposition.
The proposed INN architecture uses distinct cross-material convolutional neural
network (CNN) in image refining modules, and uses image decomposition physics
in image reconstruction modules. The distinct cross-material CNN refiners
incorporate distinct encoding-decoding filters and cross-material model that
captures correlations between different materials. We study the distinct
cross-material CNN refiner with patch-based reformulation and tight-frame
condition. Numerical experiments with extended cardiactorso (XCAT) phantom and
clinical data show that the proposed INN significantly improves the image
quality over several image-domain material decomposition methods, including a
conventional model-based image decomposition (MBID) method using an
edge-preserving regularizer, a recent MBID method using pre-learned
material-wise sparsifying transforms, and a noniterative deep CNN method. Our
study with patch-based reformulations reveals that learned filters of distinct
cross-material CNN refiners can approximately satisfy the tight-frame
condition.]]></summary>

attributes (given as supervision at training time e.g. domain label) while
leaving the unlabeled attributes intact. Current methods achieve either: (i)
disentanglement, which exhibits low visual fidelity and can only be satisfied
where the attributes are perfectly uncorrelated. (ii) visually-plausible
translations, which are clearly not disentangled. In this work, we propose
OverLORD, a single framework for disentangling labeled and unlabeled attributes
as well as synthesizing high-fidelity images, which is composed of two stages;
(i) Disentanglement: Learning disentangled representations with latent
optimization. Differently from previous approaches, we do not rely on
adversarial training or any architectural biases. (ii) Synthesis: Training
feed-forward encoders for inferring the learned attributes and tuning the
generator in an adversarial manner to increase the perceptual quality. When the
labeled and unlabeled attributes are correlated, we model an additional
representation that accounts for the correlated attributes and improves
disentanglement. We highlight that our flexible framework covers multiple
settings as disentangling labeled attributes, pose and appearance, localized
concepts, and shape and texture. We present significantly better
disentanglement with higher translation quality and greater output diversity

results. However, the point feature often lacks the information of the whole
object, thereby leading to a misalignment between the object and the point
feature. Meanwhile, the classification and regression tasks are sensitive to
different object regions, but their features are spatially aligned. Both of
these two problems hinder the detection performance. In order to solve these
two problems, we propose a simple and plug-in operator that can generate
aligned and disentangled features for each task, respectively, without breaking
the fully convolutional manner. By predicting two task-aware point sets that
are located in each sensitive region, the proposed operator can align the point
feature with the object and disentangle the two tasks from the spatial
dimension. We also reveal an interesting finding of the opposite effect of the
long-range skip connection for classification and regression. On the basis of
the Object-Aligned and Task-disentangled operator (OAT), we propose OAT-Net,
which explicitly exploits point-set features for accurate detection results.
Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO dataset show that OAT can consistently
boost different state-of-the-art one-stage detectors by $\sim$2 AP. Notably,
OAT-Net with Res2Net-101-DCN backbone achieves 53.7 AP on the COCO test-dev.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Albeit current salient object detection (SOD) works have achieved fantastic
progress, they are cast into the shade when it comes to the integrity of the
predicted salient regions. We define the concept of integrity at both the micro
and macro level. Specifically, at the micro level, the model should highlight
all parts that belong to a certain salient object, while at the macro level,
the model needs to discover all salient objects from the given image scene. To
facilitate integrity learning for salient object detection, we design a novel
Integrity Cognition Network (ICON), which explores three important components
to learn strong integrity features. 1) Unlike the existing models that focus
more on feature discriminability, we introduce a diverse feature aggregation
(DFA) component to aggregate features with various receptive fields (i.e.,,
kernel shape and context) and increase the feature diversity. Such diversity is
the foundation for mining the integral salient objects. 2) Based on the DFA
features, we introduce the integrity channel enhancement (ICE) component with
the goal of enhancing feature channels that highlight the integral salient
objects at the macro level, while suppressing the other distracting ones. 3)
After extracting the enhanced features, the part-whole verification (PWV)
method is employed to determine whether the part and whole object features have
strong agreement. Such part-whole agreements can further improve the
micro-level integrity for each salient object. To demonstrate the effectiveness
of ICON, comprehensive experiments are conducted on seven challenging
benchmarks, where promising results are achieved.]]></summary>

rates compared to LiDAR-based methods. The poor accuracy is mainly caused by
the absence of accurate location cues due to the ill-posed nature of monocular
imagery. LiDAR point clouds, which provide precise spatial measurement, can
offer beneficial information for the training of monocular methods. To make use
of LiDAR point clouds, prior works project them to form depth map labels,
subsequently training a dense depth estimator to extract explicit location
features. This indirect and complicated way introduces intermediate products,
i.e., depth map predictions, taking much computation costs as well as leading
to suboptimal performances. In this paper, we propose LPCG (LiDAR point cloud
guided monocular 3D object detection), which is a general framework for guiding
the training of monocular 3D detectors with LiDAR point clouds. Specifically,
we use LiDAR point clouds to generate pseudo labels, allowing monocular 3D
detectors to benefit from easy-collected massive unlabeled data. LPCG works
well under both supervised and unsupervised setups. Thanks to a general design,
LPCG can be plugged into any monocular 3D detector, significantly boosting the
performance. As a result, we take the first place on KITTI monocular 3D/BEV
(bird's-eye-view) detection benchmark with a considerable margin. The code will
be made publicly available soon.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep AUC Maximization (DAM) is a new paradigm for learning a deep neural
network by maximizing the AUC score of the model on a dataset. Most previous
works of AUC maximization focus on the perspective of optimization by designing
efficient stochastic algorithms, and studies on generalization performance of
large-scale DAM on difficult tasks are missing. In this work, we aim to make
DAM more practical for interesting real-world applications (e.g., medical image
classification). First, we propose a new margin-based min-max surrogate loss
function for the AUC score (named as AUC min-max-margin loss or simply AUC
margin loss for short). It is more robust than the commonly used AUC square
loss, while enjoying the same advantage in terms of large-scale stochastic
optimization. Second, we conduct extensive empirical studies of our DAM method
on four difficult medical image classification tasks, namely (i) classification
of chest x-ray images for identifying many threatening diseases, (ii)
classification of images of skin lesions for identifying melanoma, (iii)
classification of mammogram for breast cancer screening, and (iv)
classification of microscopic images for identifying tumor tissue. Our studies
demonstrate that the proposed DAM method improves the performance of optimizing
cross-entropy loss by a large margin, and also achieves better performance than
optimizing the existing AUC square loss on these medical image classification
tasks. Specifically, our DAM method has achieved the 1st place on Stanford
CheXpert competition on Aug. 31, 2020. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work that makes DAM succeed on large-scale medical image datasets. We
also conduct extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the advantages of the
new AUC margin loss over the AUC square loss on benchmark datasets. The
proposed method is implemented in our open-sourced library LibAUC
(www.libauc.org).]]></summary>

generalizable perception and policy models. However, 3D assets in existing

Manipulation Skill Benchmark (ManiSkill) to benchmark manipulation skills over
diverse objects in a full-physics simulator. 3D assets in ManiSkill include
large intra-class topological and geometric variations. Tasks are carefully
chosen to cover distinct types of manipulation challenges. Latest progress in
3D vision also makes us believe that we should customize the benchmark so that
the challenge is inviting to researchers working on 3D deep learning. To this
end, we simulate a moving panoramic camera that returns ego-centric point
clouds or RGB-D images. In addition, we would like ManiSkill to serve a broad
set of researchers interested in manipulation research. Besides supporting the
learning of policies from interactions, we also support
learning-from-demonstrations (LfD) methods, by providing a large number of
high-quality demonstrations (~36,000 successful trajectories, ~1.5M point

produce most of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Several postmortem and in vivo
studies have pointed towards their role in the inflammatory process in multiple
sclerosis (MS). Automatic segmentation of CP from MRI thus has high value for
studying their characteristics in large cohorts of patients. To the best of our
knowledge, the only freely available tool for CP segmentation is FreeSurfer but
its accuracy for this specific structure is poor. In this paper, we propose to
automatically segment CP from non-contrast enhanced T1-weighted MRI. To that
end, we introduce a new model called "Axial-MLP" based on an assembly of Axial
multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). This is inspired by recent works which showed
that the self-attention layers of Transformers can be replaced with MLPs. This
approach is systematically compared with a standard 3D U-Net, nnU-Net,
Freesurfer and FastSurfer. For our experiments, we make use of a dataset of 141
subjects (44 controls and 97 patients with MS). We show that all the tested
deep learning (DL) methods outperform FreeSurfer (Dice around 0.7 for DL vs
0.33 for FreeSurfer). Axial-MLP is competitive with U-Nets even though it is
slightly less accurate. The conclusions of our paper are two-fold: 1) the
studied deep learning methods could be useful tools to study CP in large
cohorts of MS patients; 2)~Axial-MLP is a potentially viable alternative to
convolutional neural networks for such tasks, although it could benefit from
further improvements.]]></summary>

level performance in visual saliency prediction. However, it is still unclear
how they learn the task and what it means in terms of understanding human
visual system. In this work, we develop a technique to derive explainable
saliency models from their corresponding deep neural architecture based
saliency models by applying human perception theories and the conventional
concepts of saliency. This technique helps us understand the learning pattern
of the deep network at its intermediate layers through their activation maps.
Initially, we consider two state-of-the-art deep saliency models, namely UNISAL
and MSI-Net for our interpretation. We use a set of biologically plausible
log-gabor filters for identifying and reconstructing the activation maps of
them using our explainable saliency model. The final saliency map is generated
using these reconstructed activation maps. We also build our own deep saliency
model named cross-concatenated multi-scale residual block based network
(CMRNet) for saliency prediction. Then, we evaluate and compare the performance
of the explainable models derived from UNISAL, MSI-Net and CMRNet on three
benchmark datasets with other state-of-the-art methods. Hence, we propose that
this approach of explainability can be applied to any deep visual saliency

means negative, and vice versa. Due to the sophisticated and obscure sentiment,
sarcasm brings in great challenges to sentiment analysis. In this paper, we
show up the essence of sarcastic text is that the literal sentiment (expressed
by the surface form of the text) is opposite to the deep sentiment (expressed
by the actual meaning of the text). To this end, we propose a Dual-Channel
Framework by modeling both literal and deep sentiments to recognize the
sentiment conflict. Specifically, the proposed framework is capable of
detecting the sentiment conflict between the literal and deep meanings of the

that our framework achieves the best performance on sarcasm recognition.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often outperform
conventional alternatives for denoising positron emission tomography (PET)
images, they require many low- and high-quality reference PET image pairs.
Herein, we propose an unsupervised 3D PET image denoising method based on an
anatomical information-guided attention mechanism. The proposed magnetic
resonance-guided deep decoder (MR-GDD) utilizes the spatial details and
semantic features of MR-guidance image more effectively by introducing
encoder-decoder and deep decoder subnetworks. Moreover, the specific shapes and
patterns of the guidance image do not affect the denoised PET image, because
the guidance image is input to the network through an attention gate. In a
Monte Carlo simulation of [$^{18}$F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), the
proposed method achieved the highest peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural
similarity (27.92 $\pm$ 0.44 dB/0.886 $\pm$ 0.007), as compared with Gaussian
filtering (26.68 $\pm$ 0.10 dB/0.807 $\pm$ 0.004), image guided filtering
(27.40 $\pm$ 0.11 dB/0.849 $\pm$ 0.003), deep image prior (DIP) (24.22 $\pm$
0.43 dB/0.737 $\pm$ 0.017), and MR-DIP (27.65 $\pm$ 0.42 dB/0.879 $\pm$ 0.007).
Furthermore, we experimentally visualized the behavior of the optimization
process, which is often unknown in unsupervised CNN-based restoration problems.
For preclinical (using [$^{18}$F]FDG and [$^{11}$C]raclopride) and clinical
(using [$^{18}$F]florbetapir) studies, the proposed method demonstrates
state-of-the-art denoising performance while retaining spatial resolution and
quantitative accuracy, despite using a common network architecture for various
noisy PET images with 1/10th of the full counts. These results suggest that the
proposed MR-GDD can reduce PET scan times and PET tracer doses considerably
without impacting patients.]]></summary>

development life cycle, essential to the success of large-scale software
projects. When multiple developers make concurrent changes around the same
lines of code, a merge conflict may occur. Such conflicts stall pull requests
and continuous integration pipelines for hours to several days, seriously
hurting developer productivity.

In this paper, we introduce MergeBERT, a novel neural program merge framework
based on the token-level three-way differencing and a transformer encoder
model. Exploiting restricted nature of merge conflict resolutions, we
reformulate the task of generating the resolution sequence as a classification
task over a set of primitive merge patterns extracted from real-world merge
commit data.

Our model achieves 64--69% precision of merge resolution synthesis, yielding
nearly a 2x performance improvement over existing structured and neural program
merge tools. Finally, we demonstrate versatility of our model, which is able to
perform program merge in a multilingual setting with Java, JavaScript,
TypeScript, and C# programming languages, generalizing zero-shot to unseen
languages.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, one of the key questions
is how to deal with the high noise level existing in physical quantum bits
(qubits). Quantum error correction is promising but requires an extensive
number (e.g., over 1,000) of physical qubits to create one "perfect" qubit,
exceeding the capacity of the existing quantum computers. This paper aims to
tackle the noise issue from another angle: instead of creating perfect qubits
for general quantum algorithms, we investigate the potential to mitigate the
noise issue for dedicate algorithms. Specifically, this paper targets quantum
neural network (QNN), and proposes to learn the errors in the training phase,
so that the identified QNN model can be resilient to noise. As a result, the
implementation of QNN needs no or a small number of additional physical qubits,
which is more realistic for the near-term quantum computers. To achieve this
goal, an application-specific compiler is essential: on the one hand, the error
cannot be learned if the mapping from logical qubits to physical qubits exists
randomness; on the other hand, the compiler needs to be efficient so that the
lengthy training procedure can be completed in a reasonable time. In this
paper, we utilize the recent QNN framework, QuantumFlow, as a case study.
Experimental results show that the proposed approach can optimize QNN models
for different errors in qubits, achieving up to 28% accuracy improvement
compared with the model obtained by the error-agnostic training.]]></summary>

significant quality improvements and the advent of streaming applications.
Simultaneous translation systems need to find a trade-off between translation
quality and response time, and with this purpose multiple latency measures have
been proposed. However, latency evaluations for simultaneous translation are
estimated at the sentence level, not taking into account the sequential nature
of a streaming scenario. Indeed, these sentence-level latency measures are not
well suited for continuous stream translation resulting in figures that are not
coherent with the simultaneous translation policy of the system being assessed.
This work proposes a stream-level adaptation of the current latency measures

attention recently due to its great potential for imbalanced data
classification. However, the research on Federated Deep AUC Maximization (FDAM)
is still limited. Compared with standard federated learning (FL) approaches
that focus on decomposable minimization objectives, FDAM is more complicated
due to its minimization objective is non-decomposable over individual examples.
In this paper, we propose improved FDAM algorithms for heterogeneous data by
solving the popular non-convex strongly-concave min-max formulation of DAM in a
distributed fashion, which can also be applied to a class of non-convex
strongly-concave min-max problems. A striking result of this paper is that the
communication complexity of the proposed algorithm is a constant independent of
the number of machines and also independent of the accuracy level, which
improves an existing result by orders of magnitude. The experiments have
demonstrated the effectiveness of our FDAM algorithm on benchmark datasets, and
on medical chest X-ray images from different organizations. Our experiment
shows that the performance of FDAM using data from multiple hospitals can
improve the AUC score on testing data from a single hospital for detecting
life-threatening diseases based on chest radiographs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vision-based depth estimation is a key feature in autonomous systems, which
often relies on a single camera or several independent ones. In such a
monocular setup, dense depth is obtained with either additional input from one
or several expensive LiDARs, e.g., with 64 beams, or camera-only methods, which
suffer from scale-ambiguity and infinite-depth problems. In this paper, we
propose a new alternative of densely estimating metric depth by combining a
monocular camera with a light-weight LiDAR, e.g., with 4 beams, typical of
today's automotive-grade mass-produced laser scanners. Inspired by recent
self-supervised methods, we introduce a novel framework, called LiDARTouch, to
estimate dense depth maps from monocular images with the help of ``touches'' of
LiDAR, i.e., without the need for dense ground-truth depth. In our setup, the
minimal LiDAR input contributes on three different levels: as an additional
model's input, in a self-supervised LiDAR reconstruction objective function,
and to estimate changes of pose (a key component of self-supervised depth
estimation architectures). Our LiDARTouch framework achieves new state of the
art in self-supervised depth estimation on the KITTI dataset, thus supporting
our choices of integrating the very sparse LiDAR signal with other visual
features. Moreover, we show that the use of a few-beam LiDAR alleviates scale
ambiguity and infinite-depth issues that camera-only methods suffer from. We
also demonstrate that methods from the fully-supervised depth-completion
literature can be adapted to a self-supervised regime with a minimal LiDAR
signal.]]></summary>

reconstruction has achieved significant progress recently. However, previous
methods are built upon intuitions, lacking comprehensive explanations about the
effectiveness of the pretext task in self-supervised MVS. To this end, we
propose to estimate epistemic uncertainty in self-supervised MVS, accounting
for what the model ignores. Specially, the limitations can be categorized into
two types: ambiguious supervision in foreground and invalid supervision in
background. To address these issues, we propose a novel Uncertainty reduction
Multi-view Stereo (UMVS) framework for self-supervised learning. To alleviate
ambiguous supervision in foreground, we involve extra correspondence prior with
a flow-depth consistency loss. The dense 2D correspondence of optical flows is
used to regularize the 3D stereo correspondence in MVS. To handle the invalid
supervision in background, we use Monte-Carlo Dropout to acquire the
uncertainty map and further filter the unreliable supervision signals on
invalid regions. Extensive experiments on DTU and Tank&Temples benchmark show
that our U-MVS framework achieves the best performance among unsupervised MVS
methods, with competitive performance with its supervised opponents.]]></summary>

spoken documents and questions for the optimal answer prediction. In this
paper, we propose novel training schemes for spoken question answering with a
self-supervised training stage and a contrastive representation learning stage.
In the self-supervised stage, we propose three auxiliary self-supervised tasks,
including utterance restoration, utterance insertion, and question
discrimination, and jointly train the model to capture consistency and
coherence among speech documents without any additional data or annotations. We
then propose to learn noise-invariant utterance representations in a
contrastive objective by adopting multiple augmentation strategies, including
span deletion and span substitution. Besides, we design a Temporal-Alignment
attention to semantically align the speech-text clues in the learned common
space and benefit the SQA tasks. By this means, the training schemes can more
effectively guide the generation model to predict more proper answers.
Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on
three SQA benchmarks.]]></summary>

a photo, video, mask, or a different substitute for an authorized person's
face. Most of the state-of-the-art presentation attack detection (PAD) systems
suffer from overfitting, where they achieve near-perfect scores on a single
dataset but fail on a different dataset with more realistic data. This problem
drives researchers to develop models that perform well under real-world
conditions. This is an especially challenging problem for frame-based
presentation attack detection systems that use convolutional neural networks
(CNN). To this end, we propose a new PAD approach, which combines pixel-wise
binary supervision with patch-based CNN. We believe that training a CNN with
face patches allows the model to distinguish spoofs without learning background
or dataset-specific traces. We tested the proposed method both on the standard
benchmark datasets -- Replay-Mobile, OULU-NPU -- and on a real-world dataset.
The proposed approach shows its superiority on challenging experimental setups.
Namely, it achieves higher performance on OULU-NPU protocol 3, 4 and on

many follow-up works. Despite constantly refreshing the detection accuracy,
these works suffer from handcrafted components used to eliminate redundant

a suppress-and-refine framework to remove these handcrafted components. To
fully utilize full-resolution information and achieve real-time speed, it

first suppresses noisy 3D feature points and then feeds them to 3D proposals
for the following RoI-aware refinement. With the gating mechanism to build fine

method can produce high-quality predictions with a small computation budget in

image-based plant disease diagnosis. The construction of large and publicly
available datasets containing labeled images of healthy and diseased crop
plants led to growing interest in computer vision techniques for automatic
plant disease diagnosis. Although supervised image classifiers based on deep
learning can be a powerful tool for plant disease diagnosis, they require a
huge amount of labeled data. The data mining technique of anomaly detection
includes unsupervised approaches that do not require rare samples for training
classifiers. We propose an unsupervised anomaly detection technique for
image-based plant disease diagnosis that is based on the reconstructability of
colors; a deep encoder-decoder network trained to reconstruct the colors of
\textit{healthy} plant images should fail to reconstruct colors of symptomatic
regions. Our proposed method includes a new image-based framework for plant
disease detection that utilizes a conditional adversarial network called
pix2pix and a new anomaly score based on CIEDE2000 color difference.
Experiments with PlantVillage dataset demonstrated the superiority of our
proposed method compared to an existing anomaly detector at identifying
diseased crop images in terms of accuracy, interpretability and computational

tactile images from sheared images and showing they match unsheared tactile
images collected with no sliding motion. In addition, the unsheared tactile
images give a faithful reconstruction of the contact geometry that is not
possible from the sheared data, and robust estimation of the contact pose that
can be used for servo control sliding around various 2D shapes. Finally, the
contact geometry reconstruction in conjunction with servo control sliding were
used for faithful full object reconstruction of various 2D shapes. The methods
have broad applicability to deep learning models for robots with a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due to the large success in object detection and instance segmentation, Mask
R-CNN attracts great attention and is widely adopted as a strong baseline for
arbitrary-shaped scene text detection and spotting. However, two issues remain
to be settled. The first is dense text case, which is easy to be neglected but
quite practical. There may exist multiple instances in one proposal, which
makes it difficult for the mask head to distinguish different instances and
degrades the performance. In this work, we argue that the performance
degradation results from the learning confusion issue in the mask head. We
propose to use an MLP decoder instead of the "deconv-conv" decoder in the mask
head, which alleviates the issue and promotes robustness significantly. And we
propose instance-aware mask learning in which the mask head learns to predict
the shape of the whole instance rather than classify each pixel to text or
non-text. With instance-aware mask learning, the mask branch can learn
separated and compact masks. The second is that due to large variations in
scale and aspect ratio, RPN needs complicated anchor settings, making it hard
to maintain and transfer across different datasets. To settle this issue, we
propose an adaptive label assignment in which all instances especially those
with extreme aspect ratios are guaranteed to be associated with enough anchors.
Equipped with these components, the proposed method named MAYOR achieves
state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks including DAST1500, MSRA-TD500,
ICDAR2015, CTW1500, and Total-Text.]]></summary>

generative process and a reverse degradation process to fully explore the

used in manufacturing or mechanical industries such as oil and gas over several
decades, has become a critical bottleneck in dynamic inventory management and
creation of smart P&IDs that are compatible with the latest CAD tools.
Historically, P&ID sheets have been manually generated at the design stage,
before being scanned and stored as PDFs. Current digitization initiatives
involve manual processing and are consequently very time consuming, labour
intensive and error-prone.Thanks to advances in image processing, machine and
deep learning techniques there are emerging works on P&ID digitization.
However, existing solutions face several challenges owing to the variation in
the scale, size and noise in the P&IDs, sheer complexity and crowdedness within
drawings, domain knowledge required to interpret the drawings. This motivates
our current solution called Digitize-PID which comprises of an end-to-end
pipeline for detection of core components from P&IDs like pipes, symbols and
textual information, followed by their association with each other and
eventually, the validation and correction of output data based on inherent
domain knowledge. A novel and efficient kernel-based line detection and a
two-step method for detection of complex symbols based on a fine-grained deep
recognition technique is presented in the paper. In addition, we have created
an annotated synthetic dataset, Dataset-P&ID, of 500 P&IDs by incorporating
different types of noise and complex symbols which is made available for public
use (currently there exists no public P&ID dataset). We evaluate our proposed
method on this synthetic dataset and a real-world anonymized private dataset of
12 P&ID sheets. Results show that Digitize-PID outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art for P&ID digitization.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Malignant melanoma is a common skin cancer that is mostly curable before
metastasis, where melanoma growths spawn in organs away from the original site.
Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer if left untreated due to the
high chance of metastasis. This paper presents Melatect, a machine learning
model that identifies potential malignant melanoma. A recursive computer image
analysis algorithm was used to create a machine learning model which is capable
of detecting likely melanoma. The comparison is performed using 20,000 raw
images of benign and malignant lesions from the International Skin Imaging
Collaboration (ISIC) archive that were augmented to 60,000 images. Tests of the
algorithm using subsets of the ISIC images suggest it accurately classifies
lesions as malignant or benign over 95% of the time with no apparent bias or
overfitting. The Melatect iOS app was later created (unpublished), in which the
machine learning model was embedded. With the app, users have the ability to
take pictures of skin lesions (moles) using the app, which are then processed
through the machine learning model, and users are notified whether their lesion
could be abnormal or not. Melatect provides a convenient way to get free advice
on lesions and track these lesions over time.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neuroimaging biomarkers that distinguish between typical brain aging and
Alzheimer's disease (AD) are valuable for determining how much each contributes
to cognitive decline. Machine learning models can derive multi-variate brain
change patterns related to the two processes, including the SPARE-AD (Spatial
Patterns of Atrophy for Recognition of Alzheimer's Disease) and SPARE-BA (of
Brain Aging) investigated herein. However, substantial overlap between brain
regions affected in the two processes confounds measuring them independently.
We present a methodology toward disentangling the two. T1-weighted MRI images
of 4,054 participants (48-95 years) with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI),
or cognitively normal (CN) diagnoses from the iSTAGING (Imaging-based
coordinate SysTem for AGIng and NeurodeGenerative diseases) consortium were
analyzed. First, a subset of AD patients and CN adults were selected based
purely on clinical diagnoses to train SPARE-BA1 (regression of age using CN
individuals) and SPARE-AD1 (classification of CN versus AD). Second, analogous
groups were selected based on clinical and molecular markers to train SPARE-BA2
and SPARE-AD2: amyloid-positive (A+) AD continuum group (consisting of A+AD,
A+MCI, and A+ and tau-positive CN individuals) and amyloid-negative (A-) CN
group. Finally, the combined group of the AD continuum and A-/CN individuals
was used to train SPARE-BA3, with the intention to estimate brain age
regardless of AD-related brain changes. Disentangled SPARE models derived brain
patterns that were more specific to the two types of the brain changes.
Correlation between the SPARE-BA and SPARE-AD was significantly reduced.
Correlation of disentangled SPARE-AD was non-inferior to the molecular
measurements and to the number of APOE4 alleles, but was less to AD-related
psychometric test scores, suggesting contribution of advanced brain aging to
these scores.]]></summary>

is especially important for medical image analysis, where the learning can
compensate for the scarcity of labeled datasets. A promising subclass of
unsupervised learning is self-supervised learning, which aims to learn salient
features using the raw input as the learning signal. In this paper, we use a
contrastive self-supervised learning method called SimCLR that achieved
state-of-the-art results on natural-scene images and apply this method to
digital histopathology by collecting and pretraining on 57 histopathology
datasets without any labels. We find that combining multiple multi-organ
datasets with different types of staining and resolution properties improves
the quality of the learned features. Furthermore, we find using more images for
pretraining leads to a better performance in multiple downstream tasks. Linear
classifiers trained on top of the learned features show that networks
pretrained on digital histopathology datasets perform better than ImageNet
pretrained networks, boosting task performances by more than 28% in F1 scores
on average. These findings may also be useful when applying newer contrastive
techniques to histopathology data. Pretrained PyTorch models are made publicly

homogeneous and narrow settings, which has considerably limited insights into
their out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization capabilities. To address this,
and to facilitate researchers to broadly evaluate the effectiveness of their
models, we introduce Benchmarking-IR (BEIR), a robust and heterogeneous
evaluation benchmark for information retrieval. We leverage a careful selection
of 18 publicly available datasets from diverse text retrieval tasks and domains
and evaluate 10 state-of-the-art retrieval systems including lexical, sparse,
dense, late-interaction and re-ranking architectures on the BEIR benchmark. Our
results show BM25 is a robust baseline and re-ranking and
late-interaction-based models on average achieve the best zero-shot
performances, however, at high computational costs. In contrast, dense and
sparse-retrieval models are computationally more efficient but often
underperform other approaches, highlighting the considerable room for
improvement in their generalization capabilities. We hope this framework allows
us to better evaluate and understand existing retrieval systems, and
contributes to accelerating progress towards better robust and generalizable

military propaganda, revenge porn, or bullying through social networks. To
counter these illegal activities, it has become essential to try new methods to

large enough to train neural networks for this task has become difficult
because of the privacy regulations that have been enacted in recent years. To
mitigate this limitation, in this work we propose two different solutions based
on transfer learning and multitask learning to determine whether a video has
been uploaded from or downloaded to a specific social platform through the use
of shared features with images trained on the same task. By transferring
features from the shallowest to the deepest levels of the network from the
image task to videos, we measure the amount of information shared between these
two tasks. Then, we introduce a model based on multitask learning, which learns
from both tasks simultaneously. The promising experimental results show, in
particular, the effectiveness of the multitask approach. According to our

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over-the-air computation (OAC) is a promising technique to realize fast model
aggregation in the uplink of federated edge learning. OAC, however, hinges on
accurate channel-gain precoding and strict synchronization among the edge
devices, which are challenging in practice. As such, how to design the maximum
likelihood (ML) estimator in the presence of residual channel-gain mismatch and
asynchronies is an open problem. To fill this gap, this paper formulates the
problem of misaligned OAC for federated edge learning and puts forth a whitened
matched filtering and sampling scheme to obtain oversampled, but independent,
samples from the misaligned and overlapped signals. Given the whitened samples,
a sum-product ML estimator and an aligned-sample estimator are devised to
estimate the arithmetic sum of the transmitted symbols. In particular, the
computational complexity of our sum-product ML estimator is linear in the
packet length and hence is significantly lower than the conventional ML
estimator. Extensive simulations on the test accuracy versus the average
received energy per symbol to noise power spectral density ratio (EsN0) yield
two main results: 1) In the low EsN0 regime, the aligned-sample estimator can
achieve superior test accuracy provided that the phase misalignment is
non-severe. In contrast, the ML estimator does not work well due to the error
propagation and noise enhancement in the estimation process. 2) In the high
EsN0 regime, the ML estimator attains the optimal learning performance
regardless of the severity of phase misalignment. On the other hand, the
aligned-sample estimator suffers from a test-accuracy loss caused by phase
misalignment.]]></summary>

to a policy (e.g. a claim is valid according to government rules or a post in
an online platform conforms to community guidelines). This task has been
previously instantiated as a form of textual entailment, which results in poor
accuracy due to the complexity of the policies. In this paper we propose to
address policy compliance detection via decomposing it into question answering,
where questions check whether the conditions stated in the policy apply to the
scenario, and an expression tree combines the answers to obtain the label.
Despite the initial upfront annotation cost, we demonstrate that this approach
results in better accuracy, especially in the cross-policy setup where the
policies during testing are unseen in training. In addition, it allows us to
use existing question answering models pre-trained on existing large datasets.
Finally, it explicitly identifies the information missing from a scenario in
case policy compliance cannot be determined. We conduct our experiments using a
recent dataset consisting of government policies, which we augment with expert
annotations and find that the cost of annotating question answering
decomposition is largely offset by improved inter-annotator agreement and
speed.]]></summary>

structure in animation has numerous benefits: it avoids the intractable memory
complexity of attending to individual pixels in high resolution images and
enables the use of real-world animation datasets that contain correspondence
information at the level of per-segment colors. To that end, we propose the

linguistic and semantic patterns found in the learned representations. In this
article, we probe BERT specifically to understand and measure the relational
knowledge it captures in its parametric memory. While probing for linguistic
understanding is commonly applied to all layers of BERT as well as fine-tuned
models, this has not been done for factual knowledge. We utilize existing
knowledge base completion tasks (LAMA) to probe every layer of pre-trained as
well as fine-tuned BERT models(ranking, question answering, NER). Our findings
show that knowledge is not just contained in BERT's final layers. Intermediate
layers contribute a significant amount (17-60%) to the total knowledge found.
Probing intermediate layers also reveals how different types of knowledge
emerge at varying rates. When BERT is fine-tuned, relational knowledge is
forgotten. The extent of forgetting is impacted by the fine-tuning objective
and the training data. We found that ranking models forget the least and retain
more knowledge in their final layer compared to masked language modeling and
question-answering. However, masked language modeling performed the best at
acquiring new knowledge from the training data. When it comes to learning
facts, we found that capacity and fact density are key factors. We hope this
initial work will spur further research into understanding the parametric
memory of language models and the effect of training objectives on factual
knowledge. The code to repeat the experiments is publicly available on GitHub.]]></summary>

in identifying deficiencies in its reasoning process. Explanation generation
models are typically trained in a supervised way given human explanations. When
such annotations are not available, explanations are often selected as those
portions of the input that maximise a downstream task's performance, which
corresponds to optimising an explanation's Faithfulness to a given model.
Faithfulness is one of several so-called diagnostic properties, which prior
work has identified as useful for gauging the quality of an explanation without
requiring annotations. Other diagnostic properties are Data Consistency, which
measures how similar explanations are for similar input instances, and
Confidence Indication, which shows whether the explanation reflects the
confidence of the model. In this work, we show how to directly optimise for
these diagnostic properties when training a model to generate sentence-level
explanations, which markedly improves explanation quality, agreement with human
rationales, and downstream task performance on three complex reasoning tasks.]]></summary>

based on computed tomography (CT) images offers a great help to the estimation
of intensive care unit event and the clinical decision of treatment planning.
To augment the labeled data and improve the generalization ability of the
classification model, it is necessary to aggregate data from multiple sites.
This task faces several challenges including class imbalance between mild and
severe infections, domain distribution discrepancy between sites, and presence
of heterogeneous features. In this paper, we propose a novel domain adaptation
(DA) method with two components to address these problems. The first component
is a stochastic class-balanced boosting sampling strategy that overcomes the
imbalanced learning problem and improves the classification performance on
poorly-predicted classes. The second component is a representation learning
that guarantees three properties: 1) domain-transferability by prototype
triplet loss, 2) discriminant by conditional maximum mean discrepancy loss, and
3) completeness by multi-view reconstruction loss. Particularly, we propose a
domain translator and align the heterogeneous data to the estimated class
prototypes (i.e., class centers) in a hyper-sphere manifold. Experiments on
cross-site severity assessment of COVID-19 from CT images show that the
proposed method can effectively tackle the imbalanced learning problem and
outperform recent DA approaches.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper presents a method of learning Local-GlObal Contextual Adaptation
for fully end-to-end and fast bottom-up human Pose estimation, dubbed as
LOGO-CAP. It is built on the conceptually simple center-offset formulation that
lacks inaccuracy for pose estimation. When revisiting the bottom-up human pose
estimation with the thought of "thinking, fast and slow" by D. Kahneman, we
introduce a "slow keypointer" to remedy the lack of sufficient accuracy of the
"fast keypointer". In learning the "slow keypointer", the proposed LOGO-CAP
lifts the initial "fast" keypoints by offset predictions to keypoint expansion
maps (KEMs) to counter their uncertainty in two modules. Firstly, the local
KEMs (e.g., 11x11) are extracted from a low-dimensional feature map. A proposed
convolutional message passing module learns to "re-focus" the local KEMs to the
keypoint attraction maps (KAMs) by accounting for the structured output
prediction nature of human pose estimation, which is directly supervised by the
object keypoint similarity (OKS) loss in training. Secondly, the global KEMs
are extracted, with a sufficiently large region-of-interest (e.g., 97x97), from
the keypoint heatmaps that are computed by a direct map-to-map regression.
Then, a local-global contextual adaptation module is proposed to convolve the
global KEMs using the learned KAMs as the kernels. This convolution can be
understood as the learnable offsets guided deformable and dynamic convolution
in a pose-sensitive way. The proposed method is end-to-end trainable with near
real-time inference speed, obtaining state-of-the-art performance on the COCO
keypoint benchmark for bottom-up human pose estimation. With the COCO trained
model, our LOGO-CAP also outperforms prior arts by a large margin on the
challenging OCHuman dataset.]]></summary>

performance in several tasks, such as image classification and natural language

physical adversarial examples can fool neural networks. Face-recognition
systems are used in various applications that involve security threats from
physical adversarial examples. Herein, we propose a physical adversarial attack
with the use of full-face makeup. The presence of makeup on the human face is a
reasonable possibility, which possibly increases the imperceptibility of
attacks. In our attack framework, we combine the cycle-adversarial generative
network (cycle-GAN) and a victimized classifier. The Cycle-GAN is used to
generate adversarial makeup, and the architecture of the victimized classifier
is VGG 16. Our experimental results show that our attack can effectively
overcome manual errors in makeup application, such as color and
position-related errors. We also demonstrate that the approaches used to train
the models can influence physical attacks; the adversarial perturbations
crafted from the pre-trained model are affected by the corresponding training

intrigued the vision community to study their application to computer vision
problems. Among their salient benefits, Transformers enable modeling long
dependencies between input sequence elements and support parallel processing of
sequence as compared to recurrent networks e.g., Long short-term memory (LSTM).
Different from convolutional networks, Transformers require minimal inductive
biases for their design and are naturally suited as set-functions. Furthermore,
the straightforward design of Transformers allows processing multiple
modalities (e.g., images, videos, text and speech) using similar processing
blocks and demonstrates excellent scalability to very large capacity networks
and huge datasets. These strengths have led to exciting progress on a number of
vision tasks using Transformer networks. This survey aims to provide a
comprehensive overview of the Transformer models in the computer vision
discipline. We start with an introduction to fundamental concepts behind the
success of Transformers i.e., self-attention, large-scale pre-training, and
bidirectional encoding. We then cover extensive applications of transformers in
vision including popular recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, object
detection, action recognition, and segmentation), generative modeling,
multi-modal tasks (e.g., visual-question answering, visual reasoning, and
visual grounding), video processing (e.g., activity recognition, video
forecasting), low-level vision (e.g., image super-resolution, image
enhancement, and colorization) and 3D analysis (e.g., point cloud
classification and segmentation). We compare the respective advantages and
limitations of popular techniques both in terms of architectural design and
their experimental value. Finally, we provide an analysis on open research
directions and possible future works.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We propose the first general and scalable framework to design certifiable
algorithms for robust geometric perception in the presence of outliers. Our
first contribution is to show that estimation using common robust costs, such
as truncated least squares (TLS), maximum consensus, Geman-McClure, Tukey's
biweight, among others, can be reformulated as polynomial optimization problems
(POPs). By focusing on the TLS cost, our second contribution is to exploit
sparsity in the POP and propose a sparse semidefinite programming (SDP)
relaxation that is much smaller than the standard Lasserre's hierarchy while
preserving exactness, i.e., the SDP recovers the optimizer of the nonconvex POP
with an optimality certificate. Our third contribution is to solve the SDP
relaxations at an unprecedented scale and accuracy by presenting STRIDE, a
solver that blends global descent on the convex SDP with fast local search on
the nonconvex POP. Our fourth contribution is an evaluation of the proposed
framework on six geometric perception problems including single and multiple
rotation averaging, point cloud and mesh registration, absolute pose
estimation, and category-level object pose and shape estimation. Our
experiments demonstrate that (i) our sparse SDP relaxation is exact with up to
60%-90% outliers across applications; (ii) while still being far from
real-time, STRIDE is up to 100 times faster than existing SDP solvers on
medium-scale problems, and is the only solver that can solve large-scale SDPs
with hundreds of thousands of constraints to high accuracy; (iii) STRIDE
provides a safeguard to existing fast heuristics for robust estimation (e.g.,
RANSAC or Graduated Non-Convexity), i.e., it certifies global optimality if the
heuristic estimates are optimal, or detects and allows escaping local optima
when the heuristic estimates are suboptimal.]]></summary>

low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image pairs that are constructed
by a predetermined operation, e.g., bicubic downsampling. As existing methods
typically learn an inverse mapping of the specific function, they produce
blurry results when applied to real-world images whose exact formulation is
different and unknown. Therefore, several methods attempt to synthesize much
more diverse LR samples or learn a realistic downsampling model. However, due
to restrictive assumptions on the downsampling process, they are still biased
and less generalizable. This study proposes a novel method to simulate an
unknown downsampling process without imposing restrictive prior knowledge. We
propose a generalizable low-frequency loss (LFL) in the adversarial training
framework to imitate the distribution of target LR images without using any
paired examples. Furthermore, we design an adaptive data loss (ADL) for the
downsampler, which can be adaptively learned and updated from the data during
the training loops. Extensive experiments validate that our downsampling model
can facilitate existing SR methods to perform more accurate reconstructions on

sequences with a linear attention mechanism. However, it is not compatible with
relative position encoding, which has advantages over absolute position
encoding. In this paper, we discuss possible ways to add relative position
encoding to Performer. Based on the analysis, we propose PermuteFormer, a
Performer-based model with relative position encoding that scales linearly on
long sequences. PermuteFormer applies position-dependent transformation on
queries and keys to encode positional information into the attention module.
This transformation is carefully crafted so that the final output of
self-attention is not affected by absolute positions of tokens. PermuteFormer
introduces negligible computational overhead by design that it runs as fast as
Performer. We evaluate PermuteFormer on Long-Range Arena, a dataset for long
sequences, as well as WikiText-103, a language modeling dataset. The
experiments show that PermuteFormer uniformly improves the performance of
Performer with almost no computational overhead and outperforms vanilla
Transformer on most of the tasks.]]></summary>

the model much easier to achieve exceptional downstream performance than their
counterparts directly trained on the downstream tasks. In this work, we study
what specific traits in the pre-training data, other than the semantics, make a
pre-trained LM superior to their counterparts trained from scratch on
downstream tasks. We propose to use artificially constructed datasets as the
pre-training data to exclude the effect of semantics, and further control what
characteristics the pre-training corpora have. By fine-tuning the pre-trained
models on GLUE benchmark, we can learn how beneficial it is to transfer the
knowledge from the model trained on the dataset possessing that specific trait.
We define and discuss three different characteristics in the artificial
dataset: 1) matching the token's uni-gram or bi-gram distribution between
pre-training and downstream fine-tuning, 2) the presence of the explicit
dependencies among the tokens in a sequence, 3) the length of the implicit
dependencies among the tokens in a sequence. Our experiments show that the
explicit dependencies in the sequences of the pre-training data are critical to
the downstream performance. Our results also reveal that models achieve better
downstream performance when pre-trained on a dataset with a longer range of
implicit dependencies. Based on our analysis, we find that models pre-trained
with artificial datasets are prone to learn spurious correlation in downstream
tasks. Our work reveals that even if the LMs are not pre-trained on natural
language, they still gain transferability on certain human language downstream
tasks once the LMs learn to model the token dependencies in the sequences. This
result helps us understand the exceptional transferability of pre-trained LMs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purpose: Although recent deep energy-based generative models (EBMs) have
shown encouraging results in many image generation tasks, how to take advantage
of the self-adversarial cogitation in deep EBMs to boost the performance of
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction is still desired.

Methods: With the successful application of deep learning in a wide range of
MRI reconstruction, a line of emerging research involves formulating an
optimization-based reconstruction method in the space of a generative model.
Leveraging this, a novel regularization strategy is introduced in this article
which takes advantage of self-adversarial cogitation of the deep energy-based
model. More precisely, we advocate for alternative learning a more powerful
energy-based model with maximum likelihood estimation to obtain the deep
energy-based information, represented as image prior. Simultaneously, implicit
inference with Langevin dynamics is a unique property of re-construction. In
contrast to other generative models for reconstruction, the proposed method
utilizes deep energy-based information as the image prior in reconstruction to
improve the quality of image.

Results: Experiment results that imply the proposed technique can obtain
remarkable performance in terms of high reconstruction accuracy that is
competitive with state-of-the-art methods, and does not suffer from mode
collapse.

Conclusion: Algorithmically, an iterative approach was presented to
strengthen EBM training with the gradient of energy network. The robustness and
the reproducibility of the algorithm were also experimentally validated. More
importantly, the proposed reconstruction framework can be generalized for most
MRI reconstruction scenarios.]]></summary>

than authentication using a personal identification number or an unlock
pattern, due to its convenience. It has thus become a tempting target for
attackers using a presentation attack. Traditional presentation attacks use
facial images or videos of the victim. Previous work has proven the existence
of master faces, i.e., faces that match multiple enrolled templates in face
recognition systems, and their existence extends the ability of presentation
attacks. In this paper, we perform an extensive study on latent variable
evolution (LVE), a method commonly used to generate master faces. We run an LVE
algorithm for various scenarios and with more than one database and/or face
recognition system to study the properties of the master faces and to
understand in which conditions strong master faces could be generated.
Moreover, through analysis, we hypothesize that master faces come from some
dense areas in the embedding spaces of the face recognition systems. Last but
not least, simulated presentation attacks using generated master faces
generally preserve the false-matching ability of their original digital forms,
thus demonstrating that the existence of master faces poses an actual threat.]]></summary>

tasks, while its capability of generating novel speech, similar to how GPT-2
can generate coherent paragraphs, has barely been explored. Generative Spoken
Language Modeling (GSLM) (Lakhotia et al., 2021) is the only prior work
addressing the generative aspects of speech pre-training, which replaces text
with discovered phone-like units for language modeling and shows the ability to
generate meaningful novel sentences. Unfortunately, despite eliminating the
need of text, the units used in GSLM discard most of the prosodic information.
Hence, GSLM fails to leverage prosody for better comprehension, and does not
generate expressive speech. In this work, we present a prosody-aware generative
spoken language model (pGSLM). It is composed of a multi-stream transformer
language model (MS-TLM) of speech, represented as discovered unit and prosodic
feature streams, and an adapted HiFi-GAN model converting MS-TLM outputs to
waveforms. We devise a series of metrics for prosody modeling and generation,
and re-use metrics from GSLM for content modeling. Experimental results show
that the pGSLM can utilize prosody to improve both prosody and content
modeling, and also generate natural, meaningful, and coherent speech given a
spoken prompt. Audio samples can be found at https://speechbot.github.io/pgslm.]]></summary>

very limited amount of labels or even without any labels at all. However,
existing aspect target sentiment classification (ATSC) models are not trainable
if annotated datasets are not available. Even with labeled data, they fall
short of reaching satisfactory performance. To address this, we propose simple
approaches that better solve ATSC with natural language prompts, enabling the

few-shot cases. Under the few-shot setting for SemEval 2014 Task 4 laptop

SOTA approaches by up to 24.13 accuracy points and 33.14 macro F1 points.
Moreover, we demonstrate that our prompts could handle implicitly stated
aspects as well: our models reach about 77% accuracy on detecting sentiments
for aspect categories (e.g., food), which do not necessarily appear within the
text, even though we trained the models only with explicitly mentioned aspect
terms (e.g., fajitas) from just 16 reviews - while the accuracy of the

delicate balance between fine-grained details and high-level contextualized

existing methods empirically construct encapsulated end-to-end mapping networks
without deepening into the rationality, and neglect the intrinsic prior
knowledge of restoration task. To solve the above problems, inspired by
Taylor's Approximations, we unfold Taylor's Formula to construct a novel
framework for image restoration. We find the main part and the derivative part
of Taylor's Approximations take the same effect as the two competing goals of
high-level contextualized information and spatial details of image restoration
respectively. Specifically, our framework consists of two steps,
correspondingly responsible for the mapping and derivative functions. The
former first learns the high-level contextualized information and the later
combines it with the degraded input to progressively recover local high-order
spatial details. Our proposed framework is orthogonal to existing methods and
thus can be easily integrated with them for further improvement, and extensive

measurable differences in the distributions of words or semantic content of
conversations based on demographic groups. We measure the strength of such
biases by producing artificial conversations between two copies of a dialogue
model, conditioning one conversational partner to state a name commonly
associated with a certain gender and/or race/ethnicity. We find that larger
capacity models tend to exhibit more gender bias and greater stereotyping of
occupations by gender. We show that several methods of tuning these dialogue
models, specifically name scrambling, controlled generation, and unlikelihood
training, are effective in reducing bias in conversation, including on a
downstream conversational task. Name scrambling is also effective in lowering
differences in token usage across conversations where partners have names
associated with different genders or races/ethnicities.]]></summary>

standard for the diagnosis and stratification of cancer patients. A key
challenge in the analysis of such images is their size, which can run into the
gigapixels and can require tedious screening by clinicians. With the recent
advances in computational medicine, automatic tools have been proposed to
assist clinicians in their everyday practice. Such tools typically process
these large images by slicing them into tiles that can then be encoded and
utilized for different clinical models. In this study, we propose a novel
generative framework that can learn powerful representations for such tiles by
learning to plausibly expand their visual field. In particular, we developed a
progressively grown generative model with the objective of visual field
expansion. Thus trained, our model learns to generate different tissue types
with fine details, while simultaneously learning powerful representations that
can be used for different clinical endpoints, all in a self-supervised way. To
evaluate the performance of our model, we conducted classification experiments
on CAMELYON17 and CRC benchmark datasets, comparing favorably to other
self-supervised and pre-trained strategies that are commonly used in digital
pathology. Our code is available at https://github.com/jcboyd/cdpath21-gan.]]></summary>

associated with any arbitrary aspects of commercial products, despite having a
very limited amount of labels or even without any labels at all. However,
existing aspect target sentiment classification (ATSC) models are not trainable

short of reaching satisfactory performance. To address this, we propose simple
approaches that better solve ATSC with natural language prompts, enabling the

few-shot cases. Under the few-shot setting for SemEval 2014 Task 4 laptop

SOTA approaches by up to 24.13 accuracy points and 33.14 macro F1 points.
Moreover, we demonstrate that our prompts could handle implicitly stated
aspects as well: our models reach about 77% accuracy on detecting sentiments
for aspect categories (e.g., food), which do not necessarily appear within the
text, even though we trained the models only with explicitly mentioned aspect
terms (e.g., fajitas) from just 16 reviews - while the accuracy of the

high-dimensional critic output and improve the generalization capability of the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Efficient spatiotemporal modeling is an important yet challenging problem for
video action recognition. Existing state-of-the-art methods exploit motion
clues to assist in short-term temporal modeling through temporal difference
over consecutive frames. However, insignificant noises will be inevitably
introduced due to the camera movement. Besides, movements of different actions
can vary greatly. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Saliency Integration
(TSI) block, which mainly contains a Salient Motion Excitation (SME) module and
a Cross-scale Temporal Integration (CTI) module. Specifically, SME aims to
highlight the motion-sensitive area through local-global motion modeling, where
the saliency alignment and pyramidal feature difference are conducted
successively between neighboring frames to capture motion dynamics with less
noises caused by misaligned background. CTI is designed to perform multi-scale
temporal modeling through a group of separate 1D convolutions respectively.
Meanwhile, temporal interactions across different scales are integrated with
attention mechanism. Through these two modules, long short-term temporal
relationships can be encoded efficiently by introducing limited additional
parameters. Extensive experiments are conducted on several popular benchmarks
(i.e., Something-Something V1 & V2, Kinetics-400, UCF-101, and HMDB-51), which
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The central idea of contrastive learning is to discriminate between different
instances and force different views of the same instance to share the same
representation. To avoid trivial solutions, augmentation plays an important
role in generating different views, among which random cropping is shown to be
effective for the model to learn a strong and generalized representation.
Commonly used random crop operation keeps the difference between two views
statistically consistent along the training process. In this work, we challenge
this convention by showing that adaptively controlling the disparity between
two augmented views along the training process enhances the quality of the
learnt representation. Specifically, we present a parametric cubic cropping
operation, ParamCrop, for video contrastive learning, which automatically crops
a 3D cubic from the video by differentiable 3D affine transformations.
ParamCrop is trained simultaneously with the video backbone using an
adversarial objective and learns an optimal cropping strategy from the data.
The visualizations show that the center distance and the IoU between two
augmented views are adaptively controlled by ParamCrop and the learned change
in the disparity along the training process is beneficial to learning a strong
representation. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed ParamCrop on multiple contrastive learning frameworks and video
backbones. With ParamCrop, we improve the state-of-the-art performance on both

might see in their day-to-day life. The dataset also captures the natural

However, the salient object detection results heavily rely on the quality of

first attempt to solve the RGB-D salient object detection problem with a novel
depth-awareness framework. This framework only relies on RGB data in the

solve three important challenges in RGB-D SOD task: 1) a depth awareness module
to excavate depth information and to mine ambiguous regions via adaptive
depth-error weights, 2) a spatial-aware cross-modal interaction and a
channel-aware cross-level interaction, exploiting the low-level boundary cues
and amplifying high-level salient channels, and 3) a gated multi-scale
predictor module to perceive the object saliency in different contextual
scales. Besides its high performance, our proposed UTA network is depth-free
for inference and runs in real-time with 43 FPS. Experimental evidence

Patterns of Atrophy for Recognition of Alzheimer's Disease) and SPARE-BA (of
Brain Aging) investigated herein. However, substantial overlap between brain
regions affected in the two processes confounds measuring them independently.
We present a methodology toward disentangling the two. T1-weighted MRI images
of 4,054 participants (48-95 years) with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI),
or cognitively normal (CN) diagnoses from the iSTAGING (Imaging-based
coordinate SysTem for AGIng and NeurodeGenerative diseases) consortium were
analyzed. First, a subset of AD patients and CN adults were selected based
purely on clinical diagnoses to train SPARE-BA1 (regression of age using CN
individuals) and SPARE-AD1 (classification of CN versus AD). Second, analogous
groups were selected based on clinical and molecular markers to train SPARE-BA2
and SPARE-AD2: amyloid-positive (A+) AD continuum group (consisting of A+AD,
A+MCI, and A+ and tau-positive CN individuals) and amyloid-negative (A-) CN
group. Finally, the combined group of the AD continuum and A-/CN individuals
was used to train SPARE-BA3, with the intention to estimate brain age
regardless of AD-related brain changes. Disentangled SPARE models derived brain
patterns that were more specific to the two types of the brain changes.
Correlation between the SPARE-BA and SPARE-AD was significantly reduced.
Correlation of disentangled SPARE-AD was non-inferior to the molecular
measurements and to the number of APOE4 alleles, but was less to AD-related
psychometric test scores, suggesting contribution of advanced brain aging to

mobile device using capacitive sensors which can sense the finger up to 5cm
above the screen. We use machine learning to develop data-driven models to
infer position, pose and sensor readings, based on training data from: 1. data
generated by robots, 2. data from electrostatic simulators 3. human-generated
data. Machine learned emulation is used to accelerate the electrostatic
simulation performance by a factor of millions. We combine a Conditional
Variational Autoencoder with domain expertise/models experimentally collected

generation of sequences of frames, or videos, remains extremely challenging. It
is a common belief that a key step towards solving this task resides in
modelling accurately both spatial and temporal information in video signals. A
promising direction to do so has been to learn latent variable models that
predict the future in latent space and project back to pixels, as suggested in
recent literature. Following this line of work and building on top of a family
of models introduced in prior work, Neural ODE, we investigate an approach that
models time-continuous dynamics over a continuous latent space with a
differential equation with respect to time. The intuition behind this approach
is that these trajectories in latent space could then be extrapolated to
generate video frames beyond the time steps for which the model is trained. We
show that our approach yields promising results in the task of future frame
prediction on the Moving MNIST dataset with 1 and 2 digits.]]></summary>

shown to help in both zero- and few-shot settings. For zero-shot performance,
it makes sense to design patterns that closely resemble the text seen during
self-supervised pretraining because the model has never seen anything else.
Supervised training allows for more flexibility. If we allow for tokens outside
the PLM's vocabulary, patterns can be adapted more flexibly to a PLM's
idiosyncrasies. Contrasting patterns where a "token" can be any continuous
vector vs. those where a discrete choice between vocabulary elements has to be
made, we call our method CONtinuous pAtterNs (CONAN). We evaluate CONAN on two
established benchmarks for lexical inference in context (LIiC) a.k.a. predicate
entailment, a challenging natural language understanding task with relatively
small training sets. In a direct comparison with discrete patterns, CONAN
consistently leads to improved performance, setting a new state of the art. Our
experiments give valuable insights into the kind of pattern that enhances a
PLM's performance on LIiC and raise important questions regarding our

rapidly due to the development of deep learning techniques and the availability
of large-scale QA datasets. However, the current datasets are essentially
designed for synchronic document collections (e.g., Wikipedia). Temporal news
collections such as long-term news archives spanning several decades, are
rarely used in training the models despite they are quite valuable for our
society. In order to foster the research in the field of ODQA on such
historical collections, we present ArchivalQA, a large question answering
dataset consisting of 1,067,056 question-answer pairs which is designed for
temporal news QA. In addition, we create four subparts of our dataset based on
the question difficulty levels and the containment of temporal expressions,
which we believe could be useful for training or testing ODQA systems

models, image editing has been the dominant approach to control the attributes
of synthesised face images. However, these edited results often suffer from
artifacts or incorrect feature rendering, especially when there is a large
discrepancy between the image to be edited and the desired feature set.
Therefore, we propose a new approach to mapping the latent vectors of the
generative model to the scaling factors through solving a set of multivariate
linear equations. The coefficients of the equations are the eigenvectors of the
weight parameters of the pre-trained model, which form the basis of a hyper
coordinate system. The qualitative and quantitative results both show that the
proposed method outperforms the baseline in terms of image diversity. In
addition, the method is much more time-efficient because you can obtain
synthesised images with desirable features directly from the latent vectors,
rather than the former process of editing randomly generated images requiring
many processing steps.]]></summary>

streaming video, is an important subject in real-world applications. For this
task, previous methods use recurrent neural networks for modeling temporal
relations in an input sequence. However, these methods overlook the fact that
the input image sequence includes not only the action of interest but
background and irrelevant actions. This would induce recurrent units to
accumulate unnecessary information for encoding features on the action of
interest. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel recurrent unit, named
Information Discrimination Unit (IDU), which explicitly discriminates the
information relevancy between an ongoing action and others to decide whether to
accumulate the input information. This enables learning more discriminative
representations for identifying an ongoing action. In this paper, we further
present a new recurrent unit, called Information Integration Unit (IIU), for
action anticipation. Our IIU exploits the outputs from IDU as pseudo action
labels as well as RGB frames to learn enriched features of observed actions
effectively. In experiments on TVSeries and THUMOS-14, the proposed methods
outperform state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in online action
detection and action anticipation. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed units by conducting comprehensive ablation studies.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vision transformers (ViTs) have been an alternative design paradigm to
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the training of ViTs is much
harder than CNNs, as it is sensitive to the training parameters, such as
learning rate, optimizer and warmup epoch. The reasons for training difficulty
are empirically analysed in ~\cite{xiao2021early}, and the authors conjecture
that the issue lies with the \textit{patchify-stem} of ViT models and propose
that early convolutions help transformers see better. In this paper, we further
investigate this problem and extend the above conclusion: only early
convolutions do not help for stable training, but the scaled ReLU operation in
the \textit{convolutional stem} (\textit{conv-stem}) matters. We verify, both
theoretically and empirically, that scaled ReLU in \textit{conv-stem} not only
improves training stabilization, but also increases the diversity of patch
tokens, thus boosting peak performance with a large margin via adding few
parameters and flops. In addition, extensive experiments are conducted to
demonstrate that previous ViTs are far from being well trained, further showing
that ViTs have great potential to be a better substitute of CNNs.]]></summary>

and they have similar meanings. In this paper, we propose a contrastive

document, its gold summary and its model generated summaries as different views
of the same mean representation and maximize the similarities between them

deterioration in certain video frames. Therefore, it is a natural choice to
aggregate temporal information from other frames of the same video into the
current frame. However, RoI Align, as one of the most core procedures of video
detectors, still remains extracting features from a single-frame feature map
for proposals, making the extracted RoI features lack temporal information from
videos. In this work, considering the features of the same object instance are
highly similar among frames in a video, a novel Temporal RoI Align operator is
proposed to extract features from other frames feature maps for current frame
proposals by utilizing feature similarity. The proposed Temporal RoI Align
operator can extract temporal information from the entire video for proposals.
We integrate it into single-frame video detectors and other state-of-the-art
video detectors, and conduct quantitative experiments to demonstrate that the
proposed Temporal RoI Align operator can consistently and significantly boost
the performance. Besides, the proposed Temporal RoI Align can also be applied

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Panoptic scene understanding and tracking of dynamic agents are essential for
robots and automated vehicles to navigate in urban environments. As LiDARs
provide accurate illumination-independent geometric depictions of the scene,
performing these tasks using LiDAR point clouds provides reliable predictions.
However, existing datasets lack diversity in the type of urban scenes and have
a limited number of dynamic object instances which hinders both learning of
these tasks as well as credible benchmarking of the developed methods. In this
paper, we introduce the large-scale Panoptic nuScenes benchmark dataset that
extends our popular nuScenes dataset with point-wise groundtruth annotations
for semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and panoptic tracking tasks.
To facilitate comparison, we provide several strong baselines for each of these
tasks on our proposed dataset. Moreover, we analyze the drawbacks of the
existing metrics for the panoptic tracking problem and propose a novel
instance-centric metric that addresses the concerns. We present extensive
experiments that demonstrate the utility of Panoptic nuScenes compared to
existing datasets and make the online evaluation server available at
\url{nuScenes.org}. We believe that this extension will accelerate the research
of novel methods for scene understanding of dynamic urban environments.]]></summary>

requirement in many real-world NLP applications since the inclusion of
unsupported OOD inputs may lead to catastrophic failure of systems. However, it
remains an empirical question whether current algorithms can tackle such
problem reliably in a realistic scenario where zero OOD training data is
available. In this study, we propose ProtoInfoMax, a new architecture that
extends Prototypical Networks to simultaneously process In-Domain (ID) and OOD
sentences via Mutual Information Maximization (InfoMax) objective. Experimental
results show that our proposed method can substantially improve performance up
to 20% for OOD detection in low resource settings of text classification. We
also show that ProtoInfoMax is less prone to typical over-confidence Error of
Neural Networks, leading to more reliable ID and OOD prediction outcomes.]]></summary>

many methods have been proposed for horizontal and oriented texts, previous
methods may not perform well when dealing with arbitrary-shaped texts such as
curved texts. In particular, confusion problem arises in the case of nearby
text instances. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method for
accurate arbitrary-shaped nearby scene text detection. Firstly, a One-to-Many
Training Scheme (OMTS) is designed to eliminate confusion and enable the
proposals to learn more appropriate groundtruths in the case of nearby text
instances. Secondly, we propose a Proposal Feature Attention Module (PFAM) to
exploit more effective features for each proposal, which can better adapt to
arbitrary-shaped text instances. Finally, we propose a baseline that is based
on Faster R-CNN and outputs the curve representation directly. Equipped with
PFAM and OMTS, the detector can achieve state-of-the-art or competitive
performance on several challenging benchmarks.]]></summary>

construct a predictive model based on past process executions, and then use it
to predict the future of new ongoing cases, without the possibility of updating
it with new cases when they complete their execution. This can make Predictive
Process Monitoring too rigid to deal with the variability of processes working
in real environments that continuously evolve and/or exhibit new variant
behaviours over time. As a solution to this problem, we evaluate the use of
three different strategies that allow the periodic rediscovery or incremental
construction of the predictive model so as to exploit new available data. The
evaluation focuses on the performance of the new learned predictive models, in
terms of accuracy and time, against the original one, and uses a number of real
and synthetic datasets with and without explicit Concept Drift. The results
provide an evidence of the potential of incremental learning algorithms for
predicting process monitoring in real environments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We consider the use of Gaussian process (GP) priors for solving inverse
problems in a Bayesian framework. As is well known, the computational
complexity of GPs scales cubically in the number of datapoints. We here show
that in the context of inverse problems involving integral operators, one faces
additional difficulties that hinder inversion on large grids. Furthermore, in
that context, covariance matrices can become too large to be stored. By
leveraging results about sequential disintegrations of Gaussian measures, we
are able to introduce an implicit representation of posterior covariance
matrices that reduces the memory footprint by only storing low rank
intermediate matrices, while allowing individual elements to be accessed
on-the-fly without needing to build full posterior covariance matrices.
Moreover, it allows for fast sequential inclusion of new observations. These
features are crucial when considering sequential experimental design tasks. We
demonstrate our approach by computing sequential data collection plans for
excursion set recovery for a gravimetric inverse problem, where the goal is to
provide fine resolution estimates of high density regions inside the Stromboli
volcano, Italy. Sequential data collection plans are computed by extending the
weighted integrated variance reduction (wIVR) criterion to inverse problems.
Our results show that this criterion is able to significantly reduce the
uncertainty on the excursion volume, reaching close to minimal levels of
residual uncertainty. Overall, our techniques allow the advantages of
probabilistic models to be brought to bear on large-scale inverse problems
arising in the natural sciences.]]></summary>

where the objective groundtruth is ambiguous to define, e.g., the
rehabilitation for some chronic diseases, and the prescreening of some
musculoskeletal abnormalities without further medical examinations. However,
improper uses of the annotations may hinder developing reliable models. On one
hand, forcing the use of a single groundtruth generated from multiple
annotations is less informative for the modeling. On the other hand, feeding
the model with all the annotations without proper regularization is noisy given
existing disagreements. For such issues, we propose a novel agreement learning
framework to tackle the challenge of learning from multiple annotators without
objective groundtruth. The framework has two streams, with one stream fitting
with the multiple annotators and the other stream learning agreement
information between the annotators. In particular, the agreement learning
stream produces regularization information to the classifier stream, tuning its
decision to be better in line with the agreement between the annotators. The
proposed method can be easily plugged to existing backbones developed with
majority-voted groundtruth or multiple annotations. Thereon, experiments on two

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ultrasonic imaging is being used to obtain information about the acoustic
properties of a medium by emitting waves into it and recording their
interaction using ultrasonic transducer arrays. The Delay-And-Sum (DAS)
algorithm forms images using the main path on which reflected signals travel
back to the transducers. In some applications, different insonification paths
can be considered, for instance by placing the transducers at different
locations or if strong reflectors inside the medium are known a-priori. These
different modes give rise to multiple DAS images reflecting different geometric
information about the scatterers and the challenge is to either fuse them into
one image or to directly extract higher-level information regarding the
materials of the medium, e.g., a segmentation map. Traditional image fusion
techniques typically use ad-hoc combinations of pre-defined image transforms,
pooling operations and thresholding. In this work, we propose a deep neural
network (DNN) architecture that directly maps all available data to a
segmentation map while explicitly incorporating the DAS image formation for the
different insonification paths as network layers. This enables information flow
between data pre-processing and image post-processing DNNs, trained end-to-end.
We compare our proposed method to a traditional image fusion technique using
simulated data experiments, mimicking a non-destructive testing application
with four image modes, i.e., two transducer locations and two internal
reflection boundaries. Using our approach, it is possible to obtain much more
accurate segmentation of defects.]]></summary>

efficient intermediate features. However, the input representation plays a
crucial role in this process, and polyphonic musical scores remain a

representation of symbolic music data, which transforms a polyphonic score into
a continuous signal. We evaluate the ability to learn meaningful features from
this representation from a musical point of view. Hence, we introduce an
evaluation method relying on principled generation of synthetic data. Finally,
to test our proposed representation we conduct an extensive benchmark against
recent polyphonic symbolic representations. We show that our signal-like

improvement is reflected in the metric properties and in the generation ability

method for finding a solution to an equation of the form
$\mathbf{f}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathbf{0}$ where $\mathbf{f} : \mathbb{R}^d
\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$, when only noisy measurements of $\mathbf{f}(\cdot)$
are available. In the literature to date, one can make a distinction between
"synchronous" updating, whereby the entire vector of the current guess
$\boldsymbol{\theta}_t$ is updated at each time, and "asynchronous" updating,
whereby ony one component of $\boldsymbol{\theta}_t$ is updated. In convex and
nonconvex optimization, there is also the notion of "batch" updating, whereby
some but not all components of $\boldsymbol{\theta}_t$ are updated at each time
$t$. In addition, there is also a distinction between using a "local" clock
versus a "global" clock. In the literature to date, convergence proofs when a
local clock is used make the assumption that the measurement noise is an i.i.d\
sequence, an assumption that does not hold in Reinforcement Learning (RL).

In this note, we provide a general theory of convergence for batch
asymchronous stochastic approximation (BASA), that works whether the updates
use a local clock or a global clock, for the case where the measurement noises
form a martingale difference sequence. This is the most general result to date
and encompasses all others.]]></summary>

models are used to support human decision making, in broader probabilistic
pipelines or when sensitive automatic decisions have to be taken. Studies have
shown that most models are not intrinsically well calibrated, meaning that
their decision scores are not consistent with posterior probabilities. Hence
being able to calibrate these models, or enforce calibration while learning
them, has regained interest in recent literature. In this context, properly
assessing calibration is paramount to quantify new contributions tackling
calibration. However, there is room for improvement for commonly used metrics
and evaluation of calibration could benefit from deeper analyses. Thus this
paper focuses on the empirical evaluation of calibration metrics in the context
of classification. More specifically it evaluates different estimators of the
Expected Calibration Error ($ECE$), amongst which legacy estimators and some
novel ones, proposed in this paper. We build an empirical procedure to quantify
the quality of these $ECE$ estimators, and use it to decide which estimator
should be used in practice for different settings.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accurately forecasting ridesourcing demand is important for effective
transportation planning and policy-making. With the rise of Artificial
Intelligence (AI), researchers have started to utilize machine learning models
to forecast travel demand, which, in many cases, can produce higher prediction
accuracy than statistical models. However, most existing machine-learning
studies used a global model to predict the demand and ignored the influence of
spatial heterogeneity (i.e., the spatial variations in the impacts of
explanatory variables). Spatial heterogeneity can drive the parameter
estimations varying over space; failing to consider the spatial variations may
limit the model's prediction performance. To account for spatial heterogeneity,
this study proposes a Clustering-aided Ensemble Method (CEM) to forecast the
zone-to-zone (census-tract-to-census-tract) travel demand for ridesourcing
services. Specifically, we develop a clustering framework to split the
origin-destination pairs into different clusters and ensemble the
cluster-specific machine learning models for prediction. We implement and test
the proposed methodology by using the ridesourcing-trip data in Chicago. The
results show that, with a more transparent and flexible model structure, the
CEM significantly improves the prediction accuracy than the benchmark models
(i.e., global machine-learning and statistical models directly trained on all
observations). This study offers transportation researchers and practitioners a
new methodology of travel demand forecasting, especially for new travel modes
like ridesourcing and micromobility.]]></summary>

tremendous number of parcels being transported every day. Thus, it is crucial
for the logistics industry on how to assign a candidate logistics route for
each shipping parcel properly as it leaves a significant impact on the total
logistics cost optimization and business constraints satisfaction such as
transit hub capacity and delivery proportion of delivery providers. This online
route-assignment problem can be viewed as a constrained online decision-making
problem. Notably, the large amount (beyond ${10^5}$) of daily parcels, the
variability and non-Markovian characteristics of parcel information impose
difficulties on attaining (near-) optimal solution without violating
constraints excessively. In this paper, we develop a model-free DRL approach
named PPO-RA, in which Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is improved with
dedicated techniques to address the challenges for route assignment (RA). The
actor and critic networks use attention mechanism and parameter sharing to
accommodate each incoming parcel with varying numbers and identities of
candidate routes, without modeling non-Markovian parcel arriving dynamics since
we make assumption of i.i.d. parcel arrival. We use recorded delivery parcel
data to evaluate the performance of PPO-RA by comparing it with widely-used
baselines via simulation. The results show the capability of the proposed

geoscience applications. However, due to the multi-physics, non-linear, and
multi-scale problem nature, these simulations are very expensive at desirable
grid resolutions, and the computational cost often impedes rigorous engineering
decision-making. Machine learning methods provide faster alternatives to
traditional simulators by training neural network models with numerical
simulation data mappings. Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
models are accurate yet data-intensive and are prone to overfitting. Here we
present a new architecture, U-FNO, an enhanced Fourier neural operator for
solving the multiphase flow problem. The U-FNO is designed based on the Fourier
neural operator (FNO) that learns an integral kernel in the Fourier space.
Through a systematic comparison among a CNN benchmark and three types of FNO
variations on a CO2-water multiphase problem in the context of CO2 geological
storage, we show that the U-FNO architecture has the advantages of both
traditional CNN and original FNO, providing significantly more accurate and
efficient performance than previous architectures. The trained U-FNO provides
gas saturation and pressure buildup predictions with a 10,000 times speedup

its filtration, i.e. the flow of information carried by the process through
time. By conditioning the process on its filtration, we introduce a family of
higher order kernel mean embeddings (KMEs) that generalizes the notion of KME
and captures additional information related to the filtration. We derive
empirical estimators for the associated higher order maximum mean discrepancies
(MMDs) and prove consistency. We then construct a filtration-sensitive kernel
two-sample test able to pick up information that gets missed by the standard
MMD test. In addition, leveraging our higher order MMDs we construct a family
of universal kernels on stochastic processes that allows to solve real-world
calibration and optimal stopping problems in quantitative finance (such as the
pricing of American options) via classical kernel-based regression methods.
Finally, adapting existing tests for conditional independence to the case of
stochastic processes, we design a causal-discovery algorithm to recover the
causal graph of structural dependencies among interacting bodies solely from
observations of their multidimensional trajectories.]]></summary>

vectors have been proposed in cognitive science and connectionist communities
under the names Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA), and, synonymously,
Hyperdimensional (HD) computing. In this paper, we generalize VSAs to function
spaces by mapping continuous-valued data into a vector space such that the
inner product between the representations of any two data points represents a
similarity kernel. By analogy to VSA, we call this new function encoding and
computing framework Vector Function Architecture (VFA). In VFAs, vectors can
represent individual data points as well as elements of a function space (a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space). The algebraic vector operations, inherited
from VSA, correspond to well-defined operations in function space. Furthermore,
we study a previously proposed method for encoding continuous data, fractional
power encoding (FPE), which uses exponentiation of a random base vector to
produce randomized representations of data points and fulfills the kernel
properties for inducing a VFA. We show that the distribution from which
elements of the base vector are sampled determines the shape of the FPE kernel,
which in turn induces a VFA for computing with band-limited functions. In
particular, VFAs provide an algebraic framework for implementing large-scale
kernel machines with random features, extending Rahimi and Recht, 2007.
Finally, we demonstrate several applications of VFA models to problems in image
recognition, density estimation and nonlinear regression. Our analyses and
results suggest that VFAs constitute a powerful new framework for representing
and manipulating functions in distributed neural systems, with myriad
applications in artificial intelligence.]]></summary>

tracking. However, existing multiple object tracking methods only use sparse
ground truth matching as the training objective, while ignoring the majority of

Similarity Learning, which densely samples hundreds of region proposals on a
pair of images for contrastive learning. We can directly combine this
similarity learning with existing detection methods to build Quasi-Dense
Tracking (QDTrack) without turning to displacement regression or motion priors.
We also find that the resulting distinctive feature space admits a simple
nearest neighbor search at the inference time. Despite its simplicity, QDTrack
outperforms all existing methods on MOT, BDD100K, Waymo, and TAO tracking
benchmarks. It achieves 68.7 MOTA at 20.3 FPS on MOT17 without using external

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In plane-wave imaging, multiple unfocused ultrasound waves are transmitted
into a medium of interest from different angles and an image is formed from the
recorded reflections. The number of plane waves used leads to a trade-off
between frame-rate and image quality, with single-plane-wave (SPW) imaging
being the fastest possible modality with the worst image quality. Recently,
deep learning methods have been proposed to improve ultrasound imaging. One
approach is to use image-to-image networks that work on the formed image and
another is to directly learn a mapping from data to an image. Both approaches
utilize purely data-driven models and require deep, expressive network
architectures, combined with large numbers of training samples to obtain good
results. Here, we propose a data-to-image architecture that incorporates a
wave-physics-based image formation algorithm in-between deep convolutional
neural networks. To achieve this, we implement the Fourier (FK) migration
method as network layers and train the whole network end-to-end. We compare our
proposed data-to-image network with an image-to-image network in simulated data
experiments, mimicking a medical ultrasound application. Experiments show that
it is possible to obtain high-quality SPW images, almost similar to an image
formed using 75 plane waves over an angular range of $\pm$16$^\circ$. This
illustrates the great potential of combining deep neural networks with
physics-based image formation algorithms for SPW imaging.]]></summary>

a photo, video, mask, or a different substitute for an authorized person's
face. Most of the state-of-the-art presentation attack detection (PAD) systems
suffer from overfitting, where they achieve near-perfect scores on a single
dataset but fail on a different dataset with more realistic data. This problem
drives researchers to develop models that perform well under real-world
conditions. This is an especially challenging problem for frame-based
presentation attack detection systems that use convolutional neural networks
(CNN). To this end, we propose a new PAD approach, which combines pixel-wise
binary supervision with patch-based CNN. We believe that training a CNN with
face patches allows the model to distinguish spoofs without learning background
or dataset-specific traces. We tested the proposed method both on the standard
benchmark datasets -- Replay-Mobile, OULU-NPU -- and on a real-world dataset.
The proposed approach shows its superiority on challenging experimental setups.
Namely, it achieves higher performance on OULU-NPU protocol 3, 4 and on

tactile images from sheared images and showing they match unsheared tactile

images give a faithful reconstruction of the contact geometry that is not
possible from the sheared data, and robust estimation of the contact pose that
can be used for servo control sliding around various 2D shapes. Finally, the
contact geometry reconstruction in conjunction with servo control sliding were
used for faithful full object reconstruction of various 2D shapes. The methods
have broad applicability to deep learning models for robots with a

power grids has high potential impact on smart grid monitoring. Even though
there is a natural correspondence of power flow to message-passing in GNNs,
their performance on power grids is not well-understood. We argue that there is
a gap between GNN research driven by benchmarks which contain graphs that
differ from power grids in several important aspects. Additionally, inductive
learning of GNNs across multiple power grid topologies has not been explored
with real-world data. We address this gap by means of (i) defining power grid
graph datasets in inductive settings, (ii) an exploratory analysis of graph
properties, and (iii) an empirical study of the concrete learning task of state
estimation on real-world power grids. Our results show that GNNs are more
robust to noise with up to 400% lower error compared to baselines. Furthermore,
due to the unique properties of electrical grids, we do not observe the well
known over-smoothing phenomenon of GNNs and find the best performing models to
be exceptionally deep with up to 13 layers. This is in stark contrast to
existing benchmark datasets where the consensus is that 2 to 3 layer GNNs
perform best. Our results demonstrate that a key challenge in this domain is to
effectively handle long-range dependence.]]></summary>

LiDAR semantic segmentation to a 2D segmentation task on the range image.
However, the LiDAR range image is still naturally different from the regular 2D
RGB image; for example, each position on the range image encodes the unique
geometry information. In this paper, we propose a new projection-based LiDAR
semantic segmentation pipeline that consists of a novel network structure and
an efficient post-processing step. In our network structure, we design a FID
(fully interpolation decoding) module that directly upsamples the
multi-resolution feature maps using bilinear interpolation. Inspired by the 3D
distance interpolation used in PointNet++, we argue this FID module is a 2D
version distance interpolation on $(\theta, \phi)$ space. As a parameter-free
decoding module, the FID largely reduces the model complexity by maintaining
good performance. Besides the network structure, we empirically find that our
model predictions have clear boundaries between different semantic classes.
This makes us rethink whether the widely used K-nearest-neighbor
post-processing is still necessary for our pipeline. Then, we realize the
many-to-one mapping causes the blurring effect that some points are mapped into
the same pixel and share the same label. Therefore, we propose to process those
occluded points by assigning the nearest predicted label to them. This NLA
(nearest label assignment) post-processing step shows a better performance than
KNN with faster inference speed in the ablation study. On the SemanticKITTI
dataset, our pipeline achieves the best performance among all projection-based
methods with $64 \times 2048$ resolution and all point-wise solutions. With a
ResNet-34 as the backbone, both the training and testing of our model can be
finished on a single RTX 2080 Ti with 11G memory. The code is released.]]></summary>

to a target one is studied under two settings: When unlabeled target data is
available, it is a multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) problem,
otherwise a domain generalization (DG) problem. We propose a unified framework
termed domain adaptive ensemble learning (DAEL) to address both problems. A
DAEL model is composed of a CNN feature extractor shared across domains and
multiple classifier heads each trained to specialize in a particular source
domain. Each such classifier is an expert to its own domain and a non-expert to
others. DAEL aims to learn these experts collaboratively so that when forming
an ensemble, they can leverage complementary information from each other to be
more effective for an unseen target domain. To this end, each source domain is
used in turn as a pseudo-target-domain with its own expert providing
supervisory signal to the ensemble of non-experts learned from the other
sources. For unlabeled target data under the UDA setting where real expert does
not exist, DAEL uses pseudo-label to supervise the ensemble learning. Extensive

DAEL improves the state of the art on both problems, often by significant

it involves complex and interconnected structural and functional processes that

tool to investigate equivocal neurological patterns during fetal development.
However, the number of acquisitions of satisfactory quality available in this

echo sequences of the fetal brain. This unique tool is based on a general,
flexible and realistic setup that includes stochastic fetal movements, thus
providing images of the fetal brain throughout maturation comparable to
clinical acquisitions. We demonstrate its value to evaluate the robustness and
optimize the accuracy of an algorithm for super-resolution fetal brain magnetic

architecture search(NAS) have been made. However, it is still challenging to
search for efficient networks due to the gap between the searched constraint
and real inference time exists. To search for a high-performance network with
low inference time, several previous works set a computational complexity
constraint for the search algorithm. However, many factors affect the speed of
inference(e.g., FLOPs, MACs). The correlation between a single indicator and
the latency is not strong. Currently, some re-parameterization(Rep) techniques
are proposed to convert multi-branch to single-path architecture which is
inference-friendly. Nevertheless, multi-branch architectures are still
human-defined and inefficient. In this work, we propose a new search space that
is suitable for structural re-parameterization techniques. RepNAS, a one-stage
NAS approach, is present to efficiently search the optimal diverse branch
block(ODBB) for each layer under the branch number constraint. Our experimental
results show the searched ODBB can easily surpass the manual diverse branch
block(DBB) with efficient training. Code and models will be available sooner.]]></summary>

nature of raw industry data. Preprocessing and preparing raw industrial data
for machine learning applications is a demanding task that often takes more
time and work than the actual modeling process itself and poses additional
challenges. This paper addresses one of those challenges, specifically, the
challenge of missing values due to sensor unavailability at different
production units of nonlinear production lines. In cases where only a small
proportion of the data is missing, those missing values can often be imputed.
In cases of large proportions of missing data, imputing is often not feasible,
and removing observations containing missing values is often the only option.
This paper presents a technique, that allows to utilize all of the available
data without the need of removing large amounts of observations where data is
only partially available. We do not only discuss the principal idea of the
presented method, but also show different possible implementations that can be
applied depending on the data at hand. Finally, we demonstrate the application
of the presented method with data from a steel production plant.]]></summary>

the conventional pooled global feature is likely to lose useful local
characteristics. Recent work has achieved promising performances by using deep
descriptors. They generally take all deep descriptors from neural networks into
consideration while ignoring that some of them are useless in classification
due to their limited receptive field, e.g., task-irrelevant descriptors could
be misleading and multiple aggregative descriptors from background clutter
could even overwhelm the object's presence. In this paper, we argue that a
Mutual Nearest Neighbor (MNN) relation should be established to explicitly
select the query descriptors that are most relevant to each task and discard
less relevant ones from aggregative clutters in FSL. Specifically, we propose
Discriminative Mutual Nearest Neighbor Neural Network (DMN4) for FSL. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Encouraged by the success of contrastive learning on image classification
tasks, we propose a new self-supervised method for the structured regression
task of 3D hand pose estimation. Contrastive learning makes use of unlabeled
data for the purpose of representation learning via a loss formulation that
encourages the learned feature representations to be invariant under any image
transformation. For 3D hand pose estimation, it too is desirable to have
invariance to appearance transformation such as color jitter. However, the task
requires equivariance under affine transformations, such as rotation and
translation. To address this issue, we propose an equivariant contrastive
objective and demonstrate its effectiveness in the context of 3D hand pose
estimation. We experimentally investigate the impact of invariant and
equivariant contrastive objectives and show that learning equivariant features
leads to better representations for the task of 3D hand pose estimation.
Furthermore, we show that standard ResNets with sufficient depth, trained on
additional unlabeled data, attain improvements of up to 14.5% in PA-EPE on
FreiHAND and thus achieves state-of-the-art performance without any task
specific, specialized architectures. Code and models are available at

this paper, we explore more general setups where the domain of the unlabeled
data for pre-training data differs from the domain of the labeled data for
fine-tuning, which in turn may differ from the test data domain. Our
experiments show that using target domain data during pre-training leads to
large performance improvements across a variety of setups. On a large-scale
competitive setup, we show that pre-training on unlabeled in-domain data
reduces the gap between models trained on in-domain and out-of-domain labeled
data by 66%-73%. This has obvious practical implications since it is much
easier to obtain unlabeled target domain data than labeled data. Moreover, we
find that pre-training on multiple domains improves generalization performance

how different types of knowledge emerge at varying rates. When BERT is

problem because a pedestrian can be partially occluded. The use of local
information for feature extraction and matching is still necessary. Therefore,
we propose a Pose-guided inter-and intra-part relational transformer (Pirt) for
occluded person Re-Id, which builds part-aware long-term correlations by
introducing transformers. In our framework, we firstly develop a pose-guided
feature extraction module with regional grouping and mask construction for
robust feature representations. The positions of a pedestrian in the image
under surveillance scenarios are relatively fixed, hence we propose an
intra-part and inter-part relational transformer. The intra-part module creates
local relations with mask-guided features, while the inter-part relationship
builds correlations with transformers, to develop cross relationships between
part nodes. With the collaborative learning inter- and intra-part
relationships, experiments reveal that our proposed Pirt model achieves a new
state of the art on the public occluded dataset, and further extensions on
standard non-occluded person Re-Id datasets also reveal our comparable

analysis, and hence quantifying segmentation performance is crucial. Challenges
in medical image segmentation are mainly due to spatial variations of regions
to be segmented and imbalance in distribution of classes. Commonly used metrics
treat all detected pixels, indiscriminately. However, pixels in smaller
segments must be treated differently from pixels in larger segments, as
detection of smaller ones aid in early treatment of associated disease and are
also easier to miss. To address this, we propose a novel evaluation metric for
segmentation performance, emphasizing smaller segments, by assigning higher
weightage to smaller segment pixels. Weighted false positives are also
considered in deriving the new metric named, "SSEGEP"(Small SEGment Emphasized
Performance evaluation metric), (range : 0(Bad) to 1(Good)). The experiments
were performed on diverse anatomies(eye, liver, pancreas and breast) from
publicly available datasets to show applicability of the proposed metric across
different imaging techniques. Mean opinion score (MOS) and statistical
significance testing is used to quantify the relevance of proposed approach.
Across 33 fundus images, where the largest exudate is 1.41%, and the smallest
is 0.0002% of the image, the proposed metric is 30% closer to MOS, as compared
to Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Statistical significance testing resulted
in promising p-value of order 10^{-18} with SSEGEP for hepatic tumor compared

leverage the underlying physical relationships to regularize the relationships
amongst different physical variables. We also introduce a hierarchical
generative process and a reverse degradation process to fully explore the

non-trivial parses for sentences from nine languages in an integrated and
language-agnostic manner, attaining performance superior or comparable to that
of unsupervised PCFGs. We also verify that our approach is robust to
cross-lingual transfer. Finally, we provide analyses on the inner workings of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Localizing stereo boundaries and predicting nearby disparities are difficult
because stereo boundaries induce occluded regions where matching cues are
absent. Most modern computer vision algorithms treat occlusions secondarily
(e.g., via left-right consistency checks after matching) or rely on high-level
cues to improve nearby disparities (e.g., via deep networks and large training
sets). They ignore the geometry of stereo occlusions, which dictates that the
spatial extent of occlusion must equal the amplitude of the disparity jump that
causes it. This paper introduces an energy and level-set optimizer that
improves boundaries by encoding occlusion geometry. Our model applies to
two-layer, figure-ground scenes, and it can be implemented cooperatively using
messages that pass predominantly between parents and children in an undecimated
hierarchy of multi-scale image patches. In a small collection of figure-ground
scenes curated from Middlebury and Falling Things stereo datasets, our model
provides more accurate boundaries than previous occlusion-handling stereo
techniques. This suggests new directions for creating cooperative stereo
systems that incorporate occlusion cues in a human-like manner.]]></summary>

odometry accuracy is the KITTI dataset. Beside the quality and rich sensor
setup, its success is also due to the online evaluation tool, which enables
researchers to benchmark and compare algorithms. The results are evaluated on
the test subset solely, without any knowledge about the ground truth, yielding
unbiased, overfit free and therefore relevant validation for robot localization
based on cameras, 3D laser or combination of both. However, as any sensor
setup, it requires prior calibration and rectified stereo images are provided,
introducing dependence on the default calibration parameters. Given that, a
natural question arises if a better set of calibration parameters can be found
that would yield higher odometry accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new
approach for one shot calibration of the KITTI dataset multiple camera setup.
The approach yields better calibration parameters, both in the sense of lower
calibration reprojection errors and lower visual odometry error. We conducted
experiments where we show for three different odometry algorithms, namely
SOFT2, ORB-SLAM2 and VISO2, that odometry accuracy is significantly improved
with the proposed calibration parameters. Moreover, our odometry, SOFT2, in
conjunction with the proposed calibration method achieved the highest accuracy
on the official KITTI scoreboard with 0.53% translational and 0.0009 deg/m
rotational error, outperforming even 3D laser-based methods.]]></summary>

(vision modality) and their corresponding transcripts (text modality) are able
to extract the essential information from massive multimodal data on the

have been shown to be effective in text generation tasks. However, existing MAS
models cannot leverage GPLMs' powerful generation ability. To fill this
research gap, we aim to study two research questions: 1) how to inject visual
information into GPLMs without hurting their generation ability; and 2) where
is the optimal place in GPLMs to inject the visual information? In this paper,
we present a simple yet effective method to construct vision guided (VG) GPLMs
for the MAS task using attention-based add-on layers to incorporate visual
information while maintaining their original text generation ability. Results
show that our best model significantly surpasses the prior state-of-the-art
model by 5.7 ROUGE-1, 5.3 ROUGE-2, and 5.1 ROUGE-L scores on the How2 dataset,
and our visual guidance method contributes 83.6% of the overall improvement.

$\pi$ from vertices of a graph to distinct integers that minimizes
$\sum_{\{u,v\}\in E}|\pi(u) - \pi(v)|$. In that setting, vertices are often
assumed to lie on a horizontal line and edges are drawn as semicircles above
said line. For trees, various algorithms are available to solve the problem in
polynomial time in $n=|V|$. There exist variants of the MLA in which the
arrangements are constrained. Iordanskii, and later Hochberg and Stallmann
(HS), put forward $O(n)$-time algorithms that solve the problem when
arrangements are constrained to be planar (also known as one-page book
embeddings). We also consider linear arrangements of rooted trees that are
constrained to be projective (planar embeddings where the root is not covered
by any edge). Gildea and Temperley (GT) sketched an algorithm for projective
arrangements which they claimed runs in $O(n)$ but did not provide any
justification of its cost. In contrast, Park and Levy claimed that GT's
algorithm runs in $O(n \log d_{max})$ where $d_{max}$ is the maximum degree but
did not provide sufficient detail. Here we correct an error in HS's algorithm
for the planar case, show its relationship with the projective case, and derive
simple algorithms for the projective and planar cases that run without a doubt
in $O(n)$ time.]]></summary>

pre-training for the seemingly distant summarization task works surprisingly
well for dialogue state tracking. In addition, we found that while recurrent

affective computing with major developments in the last decade. Initial efforts
on ER relied on handcrafted features that were used to characterize facial
images and then feed to standard predictive models. Recent methodologies
comprise end-to-end trainable deep learning methods that simultaneously learn
both, features and predictive model. Perhaps the most successful models are
based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While these models have excelled
at this task, they still fail at capturing local patterns that could emerge in
the learning process. We hypothesize these patterns could be captured by
variants based on locally weighted learning. Specifically, in this paper we
propose a CNN based architecture enhanced with multiple branches formed by
radial basis function (RBF) units that aims at exploiting local information at
the final stage of the learning process. Intuitively, these RBF units capture
local patterns shared by similar instances using an intermediate
representation, then the outputs of the RBFs are feed to a softmax layer that
exploits this information to improve the predictive performance of the model.
This feature could be particularly advantageous in ER as cultural / ethnicity
differences may be identified by the local units. We evaluate the proposed
method in several ER datasets and show the proposed methodology achieves
state-of-the-art in some of them, even when we adopt a pre-trained VGG-Face
model as backbone. We show it is the incorporation of local information what
makes the proposed model competitive.]]></summary>

efficiency of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it is still challenging to
strike a good balance between accuracy and efficiency while quantizing DNN
weights or activation values from high-precision formats to their quantized
counterparts. We propose a new method called elastic significant bit
quantization (ESB) that controls the number of significant bits of quantized
values to obtain better inference accuracy with fewer resources. We design a
unified mathematical formula to constrain the quantized values of the ESB with
a flexible number of significant bits. We also introduce a distribution
difference aligner (DDA) to quantitatively align the distributions between the
full-precision weight or activation values and quantized values. Consequently,
ESB is suitable for various bell-shaped distributions of weights and activation
of DNNs, thus maintaining a high inference accuracy. Benefitting from fewer
significant bits of quantized values, ESB can reduce the multiplication
complexity. We implement ESB as an accelerator and quantitatively evaluate its
efficiency on FPGAs. Extensive experimental results illustrate that ESB
quantization consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves
average accuracy improvements of 4.78%, 1.92%, and 3.56% over AlexNet,
ResNet18, and MobileNetV2, respectively. Furthermore, ESB as an accelerator can
achieve 10.95 GOPS peak performance of 1k LUTs without DSPs on the Xilinx
ZCU102 FPGA platform. Compared with CPU, GPU, and state-of-the-art accelerators
on FPGAs, the ESB accelerator can improve the energy efficiency by up to 65x,

the brightness of scenes with more than eight-bit precision, available in their
RAW-format image. We are interested in making full use of such high-precision
information to match extremely low-light scene images that conventional methods
cannot handle. For extreme low-light scenes, even if some of their brightness
information exists in the RAW format images' low bits, the standard raw image
processing on cameras fails to utilize them properly. As was recently shown by

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-party dialogue machine reading comprehension (MRC) brings tremendous
challenge since it involves multiple speakers at one dialogue, resulting in
intricate speaker information flows and noisy dialogue contexts. To alleviate
such difficulties, previous models focus on how to incorporate these
information using complex graph-based modules and additional manually labeled
data, which is usually rare in real scenarios. In this paper, we design two
labour-free self- and pseudo-self-supervised prediction tasks on speaker and
key-utterance to implicitly model the speaker information flows, and capture
salient clues in a long dialogue. Experimental results on two benchmark
datasets have justified the effectiveness of our method over competitive
baselines and current state-of-the-art models.]]></summary>

Entity Disambiguation and Entity Linking (i.e., joint mention detection and
disambiguation). However, the previously proposed autoregressive formulation
for EL suffers from i) high computational cost due to a complex (deep) decoder,
ii) non-parallelizable decoding that scales with the source sequence length,
and iii) the need for training on a large amount of data. In this work, we
propose a very efficient approach that parallelizes autoregressive linking
across all potential mentions and relies on a shallow and efficient decoder.
Moreover, we augment the generative objective with an extra discriminative
component, i.e., a correction term which lets us directly optimize the
generator's ranking. When taken together, these techniques tackle all the above
issues: our model is >70 times faster and more accurate than the previous
generative method, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches on the standard

knowledge, this is the first embodied reference dataset that allows us to study
referring expressions in daily physical scenes to understand referential
behavior, human communication, and human-robot interaction. We further devise
two benchmarks for image-based and video-based embodied reference
understanding. Comprehensive baselines and extensive experiments provide the
very first result of machine perception on how the referring expressions and
gestures affect the embodied reference understanding. Our results provide

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pretrained Transformers achieve remarkable performance when training and test
data are from the same distribution. However, in real-world scenarios, the
model often faces out-of-distribution (OOD) instances that can cause severe
semantic shift problems at inference time. Therefore, in practice, a reliable
model should identify such instances, and then either reject them during
inference or pass them over to models that handle another distribution. In this
paper, we develop an unsupervised OOD detection method, in which only the
in-distribution (ID) data are used in training. We propose to fine-tune the
Transformers with a contrastive loss, which improves the compactness of
representations, such that OOD instances can be better differentiated from ID
ones. These OOD instances can then be accurately detected using the Mahalanobis
distance in the model's penultimate layer. We experiment with comprehensive
settings and achieve near-perfect OOD detection performance, outperforming
baselines drastically. We further investigate the rationales behind the
improvement, finding that more compact representations through margin-based
contrastive learning bring the improvement. We release our code to the
community for future research.]]></summary>

the world into objects, which are selectively attended, tracked, and predicted
as we engage our surroundings. Object representations emancipate perception
from the sensory input, enabling us to keep in mind that which is out of sight
and to use perceptual content as a basis for action and symbolic cognition.
Human behavioral studies have documented how object representations emerge
through grouping, amodal completion, proto-objects, and object files. Deep
neural network (DNN) models of visual object recognition, by contrast, remain
largely tethered to the sensory input, despite achieving human-level
performance at labeling objects. Here, we review related work in both fields
and examine how these fields can help each other. The cognitive literature
provides a starting point for the development of new experimental tasks that
reveal mechanisms of human object perception and serve as benchmarks driving
development of deep neural network models that will put the object into object

encoded in modern pretrained language models (PLMs) have negative ethical
implications for widespread adoption of state-of-the-art language technology.
To remedy for this, a wide range of debiasing techniques have recently been
introduced to remove such stereotypical biases from PLMs. Existing debiasing
methods, however, directly modify all of the PLMs parameters, which -- besides
being computationally expensive -- comes with the inherent risk of
(catastrophic) forgetting of useful language knowledge acquired in pretraining.
In this work, we propose a more sustainable modular debiasing approach based on
dedicated debiasing adapters, dubbed ADELE. Concretely, we (1) inject adapter
modules into the original PLM layers and (2) update only the adapters (i.e., we
keep the original PLM parameters frozen) via language modeling training on a
counterfactually augmented corpus. We showcase ADELE, in gender debiasing of
BERT: our extensive evaluation, encompassing three intrinsic and two extrinsic
bias measures, renders ADELE, very effective in bias mitigation. We further
show that -- due to its modular nature -- ADELE, coupled with task adapters,
retains fairness even after large-scale downstream training. Finally, by means
of multilingual BERT, we successfully transfer ADELE, to six target languages.]]></summary>

distributional knowledge. In this paper, we propose StructAdapt, an adapter
method to encode graph structure into PLMs. Contrary to prior work, StructAdapt
effectively models interactions among the nodes based on the graph
connectivity, only training graph structure-aware adapter parameters. In this
way, we incorporate task-specific knowledge while maintaining the topological
structure of the graph. We empirically show the benefits of explicitly encoding
graph structure into PLMs using StructAdapt, outperforming the state of the art
on two AMR-to-text datasets, training only 5.1% of the PLM parameters.]]></summary>

surprising ability to perform zero-shot learning. For example, to classify
sentiment without any training examples, we can "prompt" the LM with the review
and the label description "Does the user like this movie?", and ask whether the
next word is "yes" or "no". However, the next word prediction training
objective is still misaligned with the target zero-shot learning objective. To
address this weakness, we propose meta-tuning, which directly optimizes the
zero-shot learning objective by fine-tuning pre-trained language models on a
collection of datasets. We focus on classification tasks, and construct the
meta-dataset by aggregating 43 existing datasets and annotating 441 label
descriptions in a question-answering (QA) format. When evaluated on unseen
tasks, meta-tuned models outperform a same-sized QA model and the previous SOTA
zero-shot learning system based on natural language inference. Additionally,
increasing parameter count from 220M to 770M improves AUC-ROC scores by 6.3%,
and we forecast that even larger models would perform better. Therefore,
measuring zero-shot learning performance on language models out-of-the-box
might underestimate their true potential, and community-wide efforts on
aggregating datasets and unifying their formats can help build models that

transferring a speaking style to the synthesised speech in a target speaker's

utterance to obtain speaking style descriptors as conditioning on the

cascading a text-to-style (T2S) model with a style-to-wave (S2W) model.
Phonetic PosteriorGram (PPG), phoneme-level pitch and energy contours are
adopted as fine-grained speaking style descriptors, which are predicted from
text using the T2S model. A novel pretrain-refinement method is adopted to
learn a robust T2S model by only using readily accessible low-quality data. The
S2W model is trained with high-quality target data, which is adopted to

that requires both advanced computer vision and NLP methods. The recent advance
in OCR enables the accurate recognition of text blocks, yet it is still
challenging to extract key information from documents due to the diversity of
their layouts. Although recent studies on pre-trained language models show the
importance of incorporating layout information on this task, the conjugation of
texts and their layouts still follows the style of BERT optimized for
understanding the 1D text. This implies there is room for further improvement
considering the 2D nature of text layouts. This paper introduces a pre-trained
language model, BERT Relying On Spatiality (BROS), which effectively utilizes
the information included in individual text blocks and their layouts.
Specifically, BROS encodes spatial information by utilizing relative positions
and learns spatial dependencies between OCR blocks with a novel area-masking
strategy. These two novel approaches lead to an efficient encoding of spatial
layout information highlighted by the robust performance of BROS under
low-resource environments. We also introduce a general-purpose parser that can
be combined with BROS to extract key information even when there is no order
information between text blocks. BROS shows its superiority on four public
benchmarks -- FUNSD, SROIE*, CORD, and SciTSR -- and its robustness in
practical cases where order information of text blocks is not available.
Further experiments with a varying number of training examples demonstrate the
high training efficiency of our approach. Our code will be open to the public.]]></summary>

techniques may be used for generating additional training samples when the
available parallel data are scarce. Many DA approaches aim at expanding the
support of the empirical data distribution by generating new sentence pairs
that contain infrequent words, thus making it closer to the true data
distribution of parallel sentences. In this paper, we propose to follow a
completely different approach and present a multi-task DA approach in which we
generate new sentence pairs with transformations, such as reversing the order

training, these augmented sentences are used as auxiliary tasks in a multi-task
framework with the aim of providing new contexts where the target prefix is not
informative enough to predict the next word. This strengthens the encoder and
forces the decoder to pay more attention to the source representations of the
encoder. Experiments carried out on six low-resource translation tasks show
consistent improvements over the baseline and over DA methods aiming at
extending the support of the empirical data distribution. The systems trained

performances by offering an interesting vocabulary-centric analysis. The
results confirm that domain-specific pretraining is fundamental to achieving
higher performances in downstream NER tasks, even within a mid-resource

without relying on other auxiliary tasks. We conduct a series of experiments on

help to build innovative information research themes, novel frameworks, and
developing connected delivery mechanisms in addition to making the world's
massive collection of music open for everyone. Modern rock music proved to be
difficult to estimate tempo and chord recognition did not work. All of the
findings indicate that modern rock and metal music can be analysed, despite its
complexity, but that further research is needed in this area to make it useful.
Using a neural network has been one of the simplest ways of dealing with it.
The pitch class profile vector is used in the neural network method. Because
the vector only contains 12 elements of semi-tone values, it is enough for
chord recognition. Of course, there are other ways of achieving this work, most
of them depend on pitch class profiling to transform the chord into a type that
can be recognised, but the recognition process is time-consuming centred on
extremely complicated and memory-intensive methods.]]></summary>

changes over time. For pre-trained language models like BERT, domain adaptation
through continued pre-training has been shown to improve performance on
in-domain downstream tasks. In this article, we investigate whether temporal
adaptation can bring additional benefits. For this purpose, we introduce a
corpus of social media comments sampled over three years. It contains
unlabelled data for adaptation and evaluation on an upstream masked language
modelling task as well as labelled data for fine-tuning and evaluation on a
downstream document classification task. We find that temporality matters for
both tasks: temporal adaptation improves upstream and temporal fine-tuning
downstream task performance. Time-specific models generally perform better on
past than on future test sets, which matches evidence on the bursty usage of
topical words. However, adapting BERT to time and domain does not improve
performance on the downstream task over only adapting to domain. Token-level
analysis shows that temporal adaptation captures event-driven changes in
language use in the downstream task, but not those changes that are actually
relevant to task performance. Based on our findings, we discuss when temporal
adaptation may be more effective.]]></summary>

models. However, such models can easily overfit noisy labels and suffer from
performance degradation. While it is very costly to filter noisy labels in
large learning resources, recent studies show that such labels take more
training steps to be memorized and are more frequently forgotten than clean
labels, therefore are identifiable in training. Motivated by such properties,
we propose a simple co-regularization framework for entity-centric information
extraction, which consists of several neural models with identical structures
but different parameter initialization. These models are jointly optimized with
the task-specific losses and are regularized to generate similar predictions
based on an agreement loss, which prevents overfitting on noisy labels.
Extensive experiments on two widely used but noisy benchmarks for information
extraction, TACRED and CoNLL03, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.
We release our code to the community for future research.]]></summary>

performances in Automatic Speech Recognition by combining convolution with
attention to model both local and global dependencies. In this paper, we study
how to reduce the Conformer architecture complexity with a limited computing
budget, leading to a more efficient architecture design that we call Efficient
Conformer. We introduce progressive downsampling to the Conformer encoder and
propose a novel attention mechanism named grouped attention, allowing us to
reduce attention complexity from $O(n^{2}d)$ to $O(n^{2}d / g)$ for sequence
length $n$, hidden dimension $d$ and group size parameter $g$. We also
experiment the use of strided multi-head self-attention as a global
downsampling operation. Our experiments are performed on the LibriSpeech
dataset with CTC and RNN-Transducer losses. We show that within the same
computing budget, the proposed architecture achieves better performances with
faster training and decoding compared to the Conformer. Our 13M parameters CTC
model achieves competitive WERs of 3.6%/9.0% without using a language model and
2.7%/6.7% with an external n-gram language model on the test-clean/test-other

tasks, while its capability of generating novel speech, similar to how GPT-2
can generate coherent paragraphs, has barely been explored. Generative Spoken
Language Modeling (GSLM) (Lakhotia et al., 2021) is the only prior work
addressing the generative aspects of speech pre-training, which replaces text
with discovered phone-like units for language modeling and shows the ability to
generate meaningful novel sentences. Unfortunately, despite eliminating the
need of text, the units used in GSLM discard most of the prosodic information.
Hence, GSLM fails to leverage prosody for better comprehension, and does not
generate expressive speech. In this work, we present a prosody-aware generative
spoken language model (pGSLM). It is composed of a multi-stream transformer
language model (MS-TLM) of speech, represented as discovered unit and prosodic
feature streams, and an adapted HiFi-GAN model converting MS-TLM outputs to
waveforms. We devise a series of metrics for prosody modeling and generation,
and re-use metrics from GSLM for content modeling. Experimental results show
that the pGSLM can utilize prosody to improve both prosody and content
modeling, and also generate natural, meaningful, and coherent speech given a
spoken prompt. Audio samples can be found at https://speechbot.github.io/pgslm.]]></summary>

learning sessions, with half of the words presented with their orthographic
forms (Audio-Ortho) and half without (Audio only). One group heard the words
pronounced by a single talker, while another group heard them pronounced by
multiple talkers. On the third day, they completed a variety of tasks to
evaluate their learning. Our results show a robust influence of orthography,
with faster response times in both production (picture naming) and recognition
(picture mapping) tasks for words learned in the Audio-Ortho condition.
Moreover, formant analyses of the picture naming responses show that
orthographic input pulls pronunciations of English novel words towards a
non-native (French) phonological target. Words learned with their orthographic
forms were pronounced more precisely (with smaller Dispersion Scores), but were
misplaced in the vowel space (as reflected by smaller Euclidian distances with
respect to French vowels). Finally, we found only limited evidence of an effect
of talker-based acoustic variability: novel words learned with multiple talkers
showed faster responses times in the picture naming task, but only in the
Audio-only condition, which suggests that orthographic information may have
overwhelmed any advantage of talker-based acoustic variability.]]></summary>

their text-only neural machine translation (NMT) counterparts when visual

is replaced with an unrelated image or noise, which suggests that the visual
context might not be exploited by the model at all. We hypothesize that this

known as Multi30K, where the translations of image captions were prepared
without actually showing the images to human translators. In this paper, we
present a qualitative study that examines the role of datasets in stimulating
the leverage of visual modality and we propose methods to highlight the
importance of visual signals in the datasets which demonstrate improvements in

also known as prompt-based learning or prompt-learning, has lately gained
significant success in comparison to the pre-train and fine-tune paradigm.
Nonetheless, virtually all prompt-based methods are token-level, meaning they
all utilize GPT's left-to-right language model or BERT's masked language model
to perform cloze-style tasks. In this paper, we attempt to accomplish several
NLP tasks in the zero-shot scenario using a BERT original pre-training task
abandoned by RoBERTa and other models--Next Sentence Prediction (NSP). Unlike
token-level techniques, our sentence-level prompt-based method NSP-BERT does
not need to fix the length of the prompt or the position to be predicted,
allowing it to handle tasks such as entity linking with ease. Based on the
characteristics of NSP-BERT, we offer several quick building templates for
various downstream tasks. We suggest a two-stage prompt method for word sense
disambiguation tasks in particular. Our strategies for mapping the labels
significantly enhance the model's performance on sentence pair tasks. On the
FewCLUE benchmark, our NSP-BERT outperforms other zero-shot methods on most of

substantially underestimate model performance, both in terms of the relevance

additional relevant facts not rated as gold. We build three strong models based
on different methodologies (generation, ranking, and schemas), and empirically
show that while expert-augmented ratings provide better estimates of
explanation quality, both original (gold) and expert-augmented automatic

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spoken question answering (SQA) requires fine-grained understanding of both
spoken documents and questions for the optimal answer prediction. In this
paper, we propose novel training schemes for spoken question answering with a
self-supervised training stage and a contrastive representation learning stage.
In the self-supervised stage, we propose three auxiliary self-supervised tasks,
including utterance restoration, utterance insertion, and question
discrimination, and jointly train the model to capture consistency and
coherence among speech documents without any additional data or annotations. We
then propose to learn noise-invariant utterance representations in a
contrastive objective by adopting multiple augmentation strategies, including
span deletion and span substitution. Besides, we design a Temporal-Alignment
attention to semantically align the speech-text clues in the learned common
space and benefit the SQA tasks. By this means, the training schemes can more
effectively guide the generation model to predict more proper answers.
Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on
three SQA benchmarks.]]></summary>

homogeneous and narrow settings, which has considerably limited insights into
their out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization capabilities. To address this,
and to facilitate researchers to broadly evaluate the effectiveness of their
models, we introduce Benchmarking-IR (BEIR), a robust and heterogeneous
evaluation benchmark for information retrieval. We leverage a careful selection
of 18 publicly available datasets from diverse text retrieval tasks and domains
and evaluate 10 state-of-the-art retrieval systems including lexical, sparse,
dense, late-interaction and re-ranking architectures on the BEIR benchmark. Our
results show BM25 is a robust baseline and re-ranking and
late-interaction-based models on average achieve the best zero-shot
performances, however, at high computational costs. In contrast, dense and
sparse-retrieval models are computationally more efficient but often
underperform other approaches, highlighting the considerable room for
improvement in their generalization capabilities. We hope this framework allows
us to better evaluate and understand existing retrieval systems, and
contributes to accelerating progress towards better robust and generalizable
systems in the future. BEIR is publicly available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recommender systems rely on user behavior data like ratings and clicks to
build personalization model. However, the collected data is observational
rather than experimental, causing various biases in the data which
significantly affect the learned model. Most existing work for recommendation
debiasing, such as the inverse propensity scoring and imputation approaches,
focuses on one or two specific biases, lacking the universal capacity that can
account for mixed or even unknown biases in the data. Towards this research
gap, we first analyze the origin of biases from the perspective of \textit{risk
discrepancy} that represents the difference between the expectation empirical
risk and the true risk. Remarkably, we derive a general learning framework that
well summarizes most existing debiasing strategies by specifying some
parameters of the general framework. This provides a valuable opportunity to
develop a universal solution for debiasing, e.g., by learning the debiasing
parameters from data. However, the training data lacks important signal of how
the data is biased and what the unbiased data looks like. To move this idea
forward, we propose \textit{AotoDebias} that leverages another (small) set of
uniform data to optimize the debiasing parameters by solving the bi-level
optimization problem with meta-learning. Through theoretical analyses, we
derive the generalization bound for AutoDebias and prove its ability to acquire
the appropriate debiasing strategy. Extensive experiments on two real datasets
and a simulated dataset demonstrated effectiveness of AutoDebias. The code is
available at \url{https://github.com/DongHande/AutoDebias}.]]></summary>

exploration through a triad of affordances: organic, algorithmic and editorial
access modes. Whilst offering great potential for discovery, such platform
developments also pose the modern user with daily adoption decisions on two
fronts: platform affordance adoption and the adoption of recommendations
therein. Following a carefully constrained set of Deezer users over a 2-year
observation period, our work explores factors driving user behaviour in the
broad sense, by differentiating users on the basis of their temporal daily
usage, adoption of the main platform affordances, and the ways in which they
react to them, especially in terms of recommendation adoption. Diverging from a
perspective common in studies on the effects of recommendation, we assume and
confirm that users exhibit very diverse behaviours in using and adopting the
platform affordances. The resulting complex and quite heterogeneous picture
demonstrates that there is no blanket answer for adoption practices of both
recommendation features and recommendations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Current app ranking and recommendation systems are mainly based on
user-generated information, e.g., number of downloads and ratings. However, new
apps often have few (or even no) user feedback, suffering from the classic
cold-start problem. How to quickly identify and then recommend new apps of high
quality is a challenging issue. Here, a fundamental requirement is the
capability to accurately measure an app's quality based on its inborn features,
rather than user-generated features. Since users obtain first-hand experience
of an app by interacting with its views, we speculate that the inborn features
are largely related to the visual quality of individual views in an app and the
ways the views switch to one another. In this work, we propose AppQ, a novel
app quality grading and recommendation system that extracts inborn features of
apps based on app source code. In particular, AppQ works in parallel to perform
code analysis to extract app-level features as well as dynamic analysis to
capture view-level layout hierarchy and the switching among views. Each app is
then expressed as an attributed view graph, which is converted into a vector
and fed to classifiers for recognizing its quality classes. Our evaluation with
an app dataset from Google Play reports that AppQ achieves the best performance
with accuracy of 85.0\%. This shows a lot of promise to warm-start app grading
and recommendation systems with AppQ.]]></summary>

large model (teacher) to a small model (student), has become an important area
of research for practical deployment of recommender systems. Recently, Relaxed
Ranking Distillation (RRD) has shown that distilling the ranking information in
the recommendation list significantly improves the performance. However, the
method still has limitations in that 1) it does not fully utilize the
prediction errors of the student model, which makes the training not fully
efficient, and 2) it only distills the user-side ranking information, which
provides an insufficient view under the sparse implicit feedback. This paper
presents Dual Correction strategy for Distillation (DCD), which transfers the
ranking information from the teacher model to the student model in a more
efficient manner. Most importantly, DCD uses the discrepancy between the
teacher model and the student model predictions to decide which knowledge to be
distilled. By doing so, DCD essentially provides the learning guidance tailored
to "correcting" what the student model has failed to accurately predict. This
process is applied for transferring the ranking information from the user-side
as well as the item-side to address sparse implicit user feedback. Our
experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art
baselines, and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component.]]></summary>

and the invertible networks are trained by maximizing the sum of the
log-likelihood on scattered measurements. This NFF model can be used to solve
data-driven forward, inverse, and mixed forward/inverse stochastic partial

porous media from their digital images. Unlike convolutional neural networks,
instead of feeding the whole image volume as inputs to the network, we model
the boundary between solid matrix and pore spaces as point clouds and feed them
as inputs to a neural network based on the PointNet architecture. This approach
overcomes the challenge of memory restriction of graphics processing units and
its consequences on the choice of batch size, and convergence. Compared to
convolutional neural networks, the proposed deep learning methodology provides
freedom to select larger batch sizes, due to reducing significantly the size of
network inputs. Specifically, we use the classification branch of PointNet and
adjust it for a regression task. As a test case, two and three dimensional
synthetic digital rock images are considered. We investigate the effect of
different components of our neural network on its performance. We compare our
deep learning strategy with a convolutional neural network from various
perspectives, specifically for maximum possible batch size. We inspect the
generalizability of our network by predicting the permeability of real-world
rock samples as well as synthetic digital rocks that are statistically
different from the samples used during training. The network predicts the
permeability of digital rocks a few thousand times faster than a Lattice
Boltzmann solver with a high level of prediction accuracy.]]></summary>

early-stopping criterion to avoid overfitting. To evaluate the applicability of
the proposed algorithm, we conduct an exhaustive experiment on synthetic data
sampled by mixing linear and nonlinear functions, multivariate normal data
sampled from Gaussian Bayesian networks, real data from the UCI repository, and

that the eigen-basis (a $p \times k$ matrix) is approximately sparse. We
propose a method that presumes the $p \times k$ matrix becomes approximately
sparse after a $k \times k$ rotation. The simplest version of the algorithm
initializes with the leading $k$ principal components. Then, the principal
components are rotated with an $k \times k$ orthogonal rotation to make them
approximately sparse. Finally, soft-thresholding is applied to the rotated
principal components. This approach differs from prior approaches because it
uses an orthogonal rotation to approximate a sparse basis. One consequence is
that a sparse component need not to be a leading eigenvector, but rather a
mixture of them. In this way, we propose a new (rotated) basis for sparse PCA.
In addition, our approach avoids "deflation" and multiple tuning parameters
required for that. Our sparse PCA framework is versatile; for example, it
extends naturally to a two-way analysis of a data matrix for simultaneous
dimensionality reduction of rows and columns. We provide evidence showing that
for the same level of sparsity, the proposed sparse PCA method is more stable
and can explain more variance compared to alternative methods. Through three
applications -- sparse coding of images, analysis of transcriptome sequencing
data, and large-scale clustering of social networks, we demonstrate the modern
usefulness of sparse PCA in exploring multivariate data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We tackle the Online 3D Bin Packing Problem, a challenging yet practically
useful variant of the classical Bin Packing Problem. In this problem, the items
are delivered to the agent without informing the full sequence information.
Agent must directly pack these items into the target bin stably without
changing their arrival order, and no further adjustment is permitted. Online
3D-BPP can be naturally formulated as Markov Decision Process (MDP). We adopt
deep reinforcement learning, in particular, the on-policy actor-critic
framework, to solve this MDP with constrained action space. To learn a
practically feasible packing policy, we propose three critical designs. First,
we propose an online analysis of packing stability based on a novel stacking
tree. It attains a high analysis accuracy while reducing the computational
complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N \log N)$, making it especially suited for RL
training. Second, we propose a decoupled packing policy learning for different
dimensions of placement which enables high-resolution spatial discretization
and hence high packing precision. Third, we introduce a reward function that
dictates the robot to place items in a far-to-near order and therefore
simplifies the collision avoidance in movement planning of the robotic arm.
Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive discussion on several key implemental

distribution is critical for real-world applications. To this end, there has
been a growing surge of interest to learn simultaneously from multiple training
domains - while enforcing different types of invariance across those domains.
Yet, all existing approaches fail to show systematic benefits under fair
evaluation protocols. In this paper, we propose a new learning scheme to
enforce domain invariance in the space of the gradients of the loss function:
specifically, we introduce a regularization term that matches the domain-level
variances of gradients across training domains. Critically, our strategy, named
Fishr, exhibits close relations with the Fisher Information and the Hessian of
the loss. We show that forcing domain-level gradient covariances to be similar
during the learning procedure eventually aligns the domain-level loss
landscapes locally around the final weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of Fishr for out-of-distribution generalization. In
particular, Fishr improves the state of the art on the DomainBed benchmark and
performs significantly better than Empirical Risk Minimization. The code is

disadvantage of MCA is that some information in the volatility surface is lost
during the calibration process and the prices of exotic options will not in
general be consistent with those of plain vanilla options. We consider an
alternative approach where the structure of the user's preferred model is
preserved but points on the volatility are features input to a neural network.
We refer to this as the volatility feature approach (VFA) model. We conduct

promising results in recent years. However, they tend to introduce multiple
tunable hyper-parameters, making them less practical in real SSL scenarios

paper, we propose a novel meta-learning based SSL algorithm (Meta-Semi) that

various conditions of SSL. We start by defining a meta optimization problem
that minimizes the loss on labeled data through dynamically reweighting the
loss on unlabeled samples, which are associated with soft pseudo labels during
training. As the meta problem is computationally intensive to solve directly,
we propose an efficient algorithm to dynamically obtain the approximate
solutions. We show theoretically that Meta-Semi converges to the stationary
point of the loss function on labeled data under mild conditions. Empirically,
Meta-Semi outperforms state-of-the-art SSL algorithms significantly on the

their general applicability. Furthermore, existing learning-based sample

Kullback-Leibler divergence broadly used in information sciences. Since the
Jeffreys divergence between Gaussian mixture models is not available in
closed-form, various techniques with pros and cons have been proposed in the
literature to either estimate, approximate, or lower and upper bound this
divergence. In this paper, we propose a simple yet fast heuristic to
approximate the Jeffreys divergence between two univariate Gaussian mixtures
with arbitrary number of components. Our heuristic relies on converting the
mixtures into pairs of dually parameterized probability densities belonging to
an exponential family. In particular, we consider the versatile polynomial
exponential family densities, and design a divergence to measure in closed-form
the goodness of fit between a Gaussian mixture and its polynomial exponential
density approximation. This goodness-of-fit divergence is a generalization of
the Hyv\"arinen divergence used to estimate models with computationally
intractable normalizers. It allows us to perform model selection by choosing
the orders of the polynomial exponential densities used to approximate the
mixtures. We demonstrate experimentally that our heuristic to approximate the
Jeffreys divergence improves by several orders of magnitude the computational
time of stochastic Monte Carlo estimations while approximating reasonably well
the Jeffreys divergence, specially when the mixtures have a very small number
of modes. Besides, our mixture-to-exponential family conversion techniques may

distance-diameter ratio that improves the separability of inter-class points

easily adopted by the residual networks for constructing the separable
hyperplanes. The synthetic binary classification experiments demonstrate the

computing results into difficulty in building an effective model with high
accuracy and stability using machine learning algorithms especially deep
learning models. Data augmentation has recently achieved considerable
performance improvement for deep learning models: increased accuracy,
stability, and reduced over-fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel data
augmentation framework, namely Generative Adversarial Network-based
Self-supervised Data Augmentation (GANSER). As the first to combine adversarial
training with self-supervised learning for EEG-based emotion recognition, the
proposed framework can generate high-quality and high-diversity simulated EEG
samples. In particular, we utilize adversarial training to learn an EEG
generator and force the generated EEG signals to approximate the distribution
of real samples, ensuring the quality of augmented samples. A transformation
function is employed to mask parts of EEG signals and force the generator to
synthesize potential EEG signals based on the remaining parts, to produce a
wide variety of samples. The masking possibility during transformation is
introduced as prior knowledge to guide to extract distinguishable features for
simulated EEG signals and generalize the classifier to the augmented sample
space. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed method can help
emotion recognition for performance gain and achieve state-of-the-art results.]]></summary>

applications of near-term quantum devices. Pioneer theoretical works suggest
that quantum generative adversarial networks (GANs) may exhibit a potential
exponential advantage over classical GANs, thus attracting widespread
attention. However, it remains elusive whether quantum GANs implemented on
near-term quantum devices can actually solve real-world learning tasks. Here,
we devise a flexible quantum GAN scheme to narrow this knowledge gap, which
could accomplish image generation with arbitrarily high-dimensional features,
and could also take advantage of quantum superposition to train multiple
examples in parallel. For the first time, we experimentally achieve the
learning and generation of real-world hand-written digit images on a
superconducting quantum processor. Moreover, we utilize a gray-scale bar
dataset to exhibit the competitive performance between quantum GANs and the
classical GANs based on multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural network
architectures, respectively, benchmarked by the Fr\'echet Distance score. Our
work provides guidance for developing advanced quantum generative models on

Navigation Satellite System / Inertial Navigation System (GNSS/INS) integrated
vehicle navigation in GNSS-challenged environments. However, the odometer is
inaccessible in many applications, especially for aftermarket devices. To apply
forward speed aiding without hardware wheeled odometer, we propose OdoNet, an
untethered one-dimensional Convolution Neural Network (CNN)-based
pseudo-odometer model learning from a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU),
which can act as an alternative to the wheeled odometer. Dedicated experiments
have been conducted to verify the feasibility and robustness of the OdoNet. The
results indicate that the IMU individuality, the vehicle loads, and the road
conditions have little impact on the robustness and precision of the OdoNet,
while the IMU biases and the mounting angles may notably ruin the OdoNet. Thus,
a data-cleaning procedure is added to effectively mitigate the impacts of the
IMU biases and the mounting angles. Compared to the process using only
non-holonomic constraint (NHC), after employing the pseudo-odometer, the
positioning error is reduced by around 68%, while the percentage is around 74%
for the hardware wheeled odometer. In conclusion, the proposed OdoNet can be
employed as an untethered pseudo-odometer for vehicle navigation, which can
efficiently improve the accuracy and reliability of the positioning in
GNSS-denied environments.]]></summary>

SimJEB's models are all designed for the same engineering function and thus
have consistent structural loads and support conditions. On the other hand,
SimJEB models are more complex, diverse, and realistic than the synthetically

designs in SimJEB were derived from submissions to the GrabCAD Jet Engine
Bracket Challenge: an open engineering design competition with over 700

significantly (1.51 - 2.65 BLEU) when a sufficient amount of correct context is

understanding the underlying mechanisms of many psychiatric disorders. Many
recent analyses adopt graph convolutional networks, to study non-linear
interactions between functionally-correlated states. However, although patterns
of brain activation are known to be hierarchically organised in both space and
time, many methods have failed to extract powerful spatio-temporal features. To
overcome those challenges, and improve understanding of long-range functional
dynamics, we translate an approach, from the domain of skeleton-based action
recognition, designed to model interactions across space and time. We evaluate
this approach using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset on sex
classification and fluid intelligence prediction. To account for subject
topographic variability of functional organisation, we modelled functional
connectomes using multi-resolution dual-regressed (subject-specific) ICA nodes.
Results show a prediction accuracy of 94.4% for sex classification (an increase
of 6.2% compared to other methods), and an improvement of correlation with
fluid intelligence of 0.325 vs 0.144, relative to a baseline model that encodes
space and time separately. Results suggest that explicit encoding of
spatio-temporal dynamics of brain functional activity may improve the precision
with which behavioural and cognitive phenotypes may be predicted in the future.]]></summary>

weights and activations, has emerged as one of the key ingredients to reduce
the size of neural networks for their deployments to resource-limited devices.
In order to overcome the nature of transforming continuous activations and
weights to discrete ones, recent study called Relaxed Quantization (RQ)
[Louizos et al. 2019] successfully employ the popular Gumbel-Softmax that
allows this transformation with efficient gradient-based optimization. However,
RQ with this Gumbel-Softmax relaxation still suffers from bias-variance
trade-off depending on the temperature parameter of Gumbel-Softmax. To resolve
the issue, we propose a novel method, Semi-Relaxed Quantization (SRQ) that uses
multi-class straight-through estimator to effectively reduce the bias and
variance, along with a new regularization technique, DropBits that replaces
dropout regularization to randomly drop the bits instead of neurons to further
reduce the bias of the multi-class straight-through estimator in SRQ. As a
natural extension of DropBits, we further introduce the way of learning
heterogeneous quantization levels to find proper bit-length for each layer
using DropBits. We experimentally validate our method on various benchmark
datasets and network architectures, and also support the quantized lottery
ticket hypothesis: learning heterogeneous quantization levels outperforms the
case using the same but fixed quantization levels from scratch.]]></summary>

which only activate and cause misclassifications on model inputs containing a
specific trigger. Existing works on backdoor attacks and defenses, however,
mostly focus on digital attacks that use digitally generated patterns as
triggers. A critical question remains unanswered: can backdoor attacks succeed
using physical objects as triggers, thus making them a credible threat against
deep learning systems in the real world? We conduct a detailed empirical study
to explore this question for facial recognition, a critical deep learning task.
Using seven physical objects as triggers, we collect a custom dataset of 3205
images of ten volunteers and use it to study the feasibility of physical
backdoor attacks under a variety of real-world conditions. Our study reveals
two key findings. First, physical backdoor attacks can be highly successful if
they are carefully configured to overcome the constraints imposed by physical
objects. In particular, the placement of successful triggers is largely
constrained by the target model's dependence on key facial features. Second,
four of today's state-of-the-art defenses against (digital) backdoors are
ineffective against physical backdoors, because the use of physical objects
breaks core assumptions used to construct these defenses. Our study confirms
that (physical) backdoor attacks are not a hypothetical phenomenon but rather
pose a serious real-world threat to critical classification tasks. We need new
and more robust defenses against backdoors in the physical world.]]></summary>

an umbrella term for online hateful behavior, manifests itself in forms such as
online hate speech. Hate speech is a deliberate attack directed towards an
individual or a group motivated by the targeted entity's identity or opinions.
The rising mass communication through social media further exacerbates the
harmful consequences of online hate speech. While there has been significant
research on hate-speech identification using Natural Language Processing (NLP),
the work on utilizing NLP for prevention and intervention of online hate speech
lacks relatively. This paper presents a holistic conceptual framework on
hate-speech NLP countering methods along with a thorough survey on the current

multiple areas of machine learning. This paper is focused on graph-Laplacian
dimension reduction for the spectral clustering of data as a primary
application. Spectral embedding provides a low-dimensional parametrization of
the data manifold which makes the subsequent task (e.g., clustering) much
easier. However, despite reducing the dimensionality of data, the overall
computational cost may still be prohibitive for large data sets due to two
factors. First, computing the partial eigendecomposition of the graph-Laplacian
typically requires a large Krylov subspace. Second, after the spectral
embedding is complete, one still has to operate with the same number of data
points. For example, clustering of the embedded data is typically performed
with various relaxations of k-means which computational cost scales poorly with
respect to the size of data set. In this work, we switch the focus from the
entire data set to a subset of graph vertices (target subset). We develop two
novel algorithms for such low-dimensional representation of the original graph
that preserves important global distances between the nodes of the target
subset. In particular, it allows to ensure that target subset clustering is
consistent with the spectral clustering of the full data set if one would
perform such. That is achieved by a properly parametrized reduced-order model
(ROM) of the graph-Laplacian that approximates accurately the diffusion
transfer function of the original graph for inputs and outputs restricted to
the target subset. Working with a small target subset reduces greatly the
required dimension of Krylov subspace and allows to exploit the conventional
algorithms (like approximations of k-means) in the regimes when they are most
robust and efficient.]]></summary>

consensus votes were benchmarked against clinical (arthroscopy) and
radiological (senior-most radiologist) observations. The IRR of the consensus
votes was compared to the IRR of the majority and most confident votes of the
two cohorts.The radiologist cohort saw an improvement of 23% in IRR of swarm
votes over majority vote. Similar improvement of 23% in IRR in 3-resident swarm
votes over majority vote, was observed. The 5-resident swarm had an even higher
improvement of 32% in IRR over majority vote. Swarm consensus votes also
improved specificity by up to 50%. The swarm consensus votes outperformed
individual and majority vote decisions in both the radiologists and resident

positive effect of increased swarm size. The attending and resident swarms also

MRI is a challenging field of research. Most of the existing literature on
survival prediction is based on Radiomic features, which does not consider
either non-biological factors or the functional neurological status of the
patient(s). Besides, the selection of an appropriate cut-off for survival and
the presence of censored data create further problems. Application of deep
learning models for OS prediction is also limited due to the lack of large
annotated publicly available datasets. In this scenario we analyse the
potential of two novel neuroimaging feature families, extracted from brain
parcellation atlases and spatial habitats, along with classical radiomic and
geometric features; to study their combined predictive power for analysing
overall survival. A cross validation strategy with grid search is proposed to
simultaneously select and evaluate the most predictive feature subset based on
its predictive power. A Cox Proportional Hazard (CoxPH) model is employed for
univariate feature selection, followed by the prediction of patient-specific
survival functions by three multivariate parsimonious models viz. Coxnet,
Random survival forests (RSF) and Survival SVM (SSVM). The brain cancer MRI
data used for this research was taken from two open-access collections TCGA-GBM
and TCGA-LGG available from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Corresponding
survival data for each patient was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA). A high cross validation $C-index$ score of $0.82\pm.10$ was achieved
using RSF with the best $24$ selected features. Age was found to be the most
important biological predictor. There were $9$, $6$, $6$ and $2$ features
selected from the parcellation, habitat, radiomic and region-based feature
groups respectively.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prescriptive process monitoring is a family of techniques to optimize the
performance of a business process by triggering interventions at runtime.
Existing prescriptive process monitoring techniques assume that the number of
interventions that may be triggered is unbounded. In practice, though, specific
interventions consume resources with finite capacity. For example, in a loan
origination process, an intervention may consist of preparing an alternative
loan offer to increase the applicant's chances of taking a loan. This
intervention requires a certain amount of time from a credit officer, and thus,
it is not possible to trigger this intervention in all cases. This paper
proposes a prescriptive process monitoring technique that triggers
interventions to optimize a cost function under fixed resource constraints. The
proposed technique relies on predictive modeling to identify cases that are
likely to lead to a negative outcome, in combination with causal inference to
estimate the effect of an intervention on the outcome of the case. These
outputs are then used to allocate resources to interventions to maximize a cost
function. A preliminary empirical evaluation suggests that the proposed
approach produces a higher net gain than a purely predictive (non-causal)
baseline.]]></summary>

convolutional layers extracted from the large-scale Pretrained Audio Neural
Networks for audio pattern recognition (PANNs) and the Wavegram-Log-Mel-CNN to
aggregate feature representations of the Log-Mel Spectrograms. Finally, we use
the combined features to train a binary classifier. In this study, we use a
dataset provided by the AICovidVN 115M Challenge, which includes a total of
7371 recorded cough sounds collected throughout Vietnam, India, and
Switzerland. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves an AUC
score of 92.8% and ranks the 1st place on the leaderboard of the AICovidVN

Huber contamination model, in which a proportion of the data comes from an
unknown outlier distribution. We provide the first results for this problem
under a large family of losses, called Besov integral probability metrics
(IPMs), that includes $\mathcal{L}^p$, Wasserstein, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and
other common distances between probability distributions. Specifically, under a
range of smoothness assumptions on the population and outlier distributions, we
show that a re-scaled thresholding wavelet series estimator achieves minimax
optimal convergence rates under a wide variety of losses. Finally, based on
connections that have recently been shown between nonparametric density
estimation under IPM losses and generative adversarial networks (GANs), we show
that certain GAN architectures also achieve these minimax rates.]]></summary>

large-scale model in a decentralized manner without needing to access user data
directly. It helps protect the users' private data from centralized collecting.
Unlike distributed machine learning, federated learning aims to tackle non-IID
data from heterogeneous sources in various real-world applications, such as
those on smartphones. Existing federated learning approaches usually adopt a
single global model to capture the shared knowledge of all users by aggregating
their gradients, regardless of the discrepancy between their data
distributions. However, due to the diverse nature of user behaviors, assigning
users' gradients to different global models (i.e., centers) can better capture
the heterogeneity of data distributions across users. Our paper proposes a
novel multi-center aggregation mechanism for federated learning, which learns
multiple global models from the non-IID user data and simultaneously derives
the optimal matching between users and centers. We formulate the problem as a
joint optimization that can be efficiently solved by a stochastic expectation
maximization (EM) algorithm. Our experimental results on benchmark datasets
show that our method outperforms several popular federated learning methods.]]></summary>

link random heterogeneous, two-phase materials of arbitrary phase fractions to
their elastic macroscale stiffness thus replacing explicit homogenization
simulations. In order to reduce the uncertainty of the true stiffness of the
synthetic composites due to unknown boundary conditions (BCs), the CNNs predict
beyond the stiffness for periodic BC the upper bound through kinematically
uniform BC, and the lower bound through stress uniform BC. This work describes
the workflow of the homogenization-CNN, from microstructure generation over the
CNN design, the operations of convolution, nonlinear activation and pooling as
well as training and validation along with backpropagation up to performance
measurements in tests. Therein the CNNs demonstrate the predictive accuracy not
only for the standard test set but also for samples of the real, two-phase
microstructure of a diamond-based coating. The CNN that covers all three
boundary types is virtually as accurate as the separate treatment in three
different nets. The CNNs of this contribution provide through stiffness bounds
an indicator of the proper RVE size for individual snapshot samples. Moreover,

engineering, editing, and more. Training such inference models is challenging
due to the lack of paired (shape, program) data in most domains. A popular
approach is to pre-train a model on synthetic data and then fine-tune on real
shapes using slow, unstable reinforcement learning. In this paper, we argue
that self-training is a viable alternative for fine-tuning such models.
Self-training is a semi-supervised learning paradigm where a model assigns
pseudo-labels to unlabeled data, and then retrains with (data, pseudo-label)
pairs as the new ground truth. We show that for constructive solid geometry and
assembly-based modeling, self-training outperforms state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning approaches. Additionally, shape program inference has a
unique property that circumvents a potential downside of self-training
(incorrect pseudo-label assignment): inferred programs are executable. For a
given shape from our distribution of interest $\mathbf{x}^*$ and its predicted
program $\mathbf{z}$, one can execute $\mathbf{z}$ to obtain a shape
$\mathbf{x}$ and train on $(\mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x})$ pairs, rather than
$(\mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x}^*)$ pairs. We term this procedure latent execution
self training (LEST). We demonstrate that self training infers shape programs
with higher shape reconstruction accuracy and converges significantly faster
than reinforcement learning approaches, and in some domains, LEST can further
improve this performance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Domain adaptation aims to leverage information from the source domain to
improve the classification performance in the target domain. It mainly utilizes
two schemes: sample reweighting and feature matching. While the first scheme
allocates different weights to individual samples, the second scheme matches
the feature of two domains using global structural statistics. The two schemes
are complementary with each other, which are expected to jointly work for
robust domain adaptation. Several methods combine the two schemes, but the
underlying relationship of samples is insufficiently analyzed due to the
neglect of the hierarchy of samples and the geometric properties between
samples. To better combine the advantages of the two schemes, we propose a
Grassmannian graph-attentional landmark selection (GGLS) framework for domain
adaptation. GGLS presents a landmark selection scheme using attention-induced
neighbors of the graphical structure of samples and performs distribution
adaptation and knowledge adaptation over Grassmann manifold. the former treats
the landmarks of each sample differently, and the latter avoids feature
distortion and achieves better geometric properties. Experimental results on
different real-world cross-domain visual recognition tasks demonstrate that
GGLS provides better classification accuracies compared with state-of-the-art
domain adaptation methods.]]></summary>

learning (DL). Quantum machine learning (QML) has the potential to
revolutionize image classification. In any typical DL-based image
classification, we use convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features
from the image and multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) to create the actual
decision boundaries. On one hand, QML models can be useful in both of these
tasks. Convolution with parameterized quantum circuits (Quanvolution) can
extract rich features from the images. On the other hand, quantum neural
network (QNN) models can create complex decision boundaries. Therefore,
Quanvolution and QNN can be used to create an end-to-end QML model for image
classification. Alternatively, we can extract image features separately using
classical dimension reduction techniques such as, Principal Components Analysis
(PCA) or Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) and use the extracted features to
train a QNN. We review two proposals on quantum-classical hybrid ML models for
image classification namely, Quanvolutional Neural Network and dimension
reduction using a classical algorithm followed by QNN. Particularly, we make a
case for trainable filters in Quanvolution and CAE-based feature extraction for
image datasets (instead of dimension reduction using linear transformations
such as, PCA). We discuss various design choices, potential opportunities, and
drawbacks of these models. We also release a Python-based framework to create
and explore these hybrid models with a variety of design choices.]]></summary>

wearables. Our framework adapts key neural architecture parameters to search
for an embedded DNN with a low hardware overhead, which can be deployed in
wearable edge devices to analyse the bio-signal data and to extract the
relevant information, such as arrhythmia and seizure. Our framework also
enables hardware-aware DNN architecture search using genetic algorithms by
imposing user requirements and hardware constraints (storage, FLOPs, etc.)
during the exploration stage, thereby limiting the number of networks explored.
Moreover, BioNetExplorer can also be used to search for DNNs based on the
user-required output classes; for instance, a user might require a specific
output class due to genetic predisposition or a pre-existing heart condition.
The use of genetic algorithms reduces the exploration time, on average, by 9x,
compared to exhaustive exploration. We are successful in identifying
Pareto-optimal designs, which can reduce the storage overhead of the DNN by
~30MB for a quality loss of less than 0.5%. To enable low-cost embedded DNNs,
BioNetExplorer also employs different model compression techniques to further

variety of tasks, including detecting anomalies, inferring application
performance, and forecasting demand. Accurate models are important, yet
accuracy can degrade over time due to concept drift, whereby either the
characteristics of the data change over time (data drift) or the relationship
between the features and the target predictor change over time (model drift).
Drift is important to detect because changes in properties of the underlying
data or relationships to the target prediction can require model retraining,
which can be time-consuming and expensive. Concept drift occurs in operational
networks for a variety of reasons, ranging from software upgrades to
seasonality to changes in user behavior. Yet, despite the prevalence of drift
in networks, its extent and effects on prediction accuracy have not been
extensively studied. This paper presents an initial exploration into concept
drift in a large cellular network in the United States for a major metropolitan
area in the context of demand forecasting. We find that concept drift arises
largely due to data drift, and it appears across different key performance
indicators (KPIs), models, training set sizes, and time intervals. We identify
the sources of concept drift for the particular problem of forecasting downlink
volume. Weekly and seasonal patterns introduce both high and low-frequency
model drift, while disasters and upgrades result in sudden drift due to
exogenous shocks. Regions with high population density, lower traffic volumes,
and higher speeds also tend to correlate with more concept drift. The features
that contribute most significantly to concept drift are User Equipment (UE)
downlink packets, UE uplink packets, and Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
total received packets.]]></summary>

significantly when retested on adversarial images, imperfect images, or
perturbed images. This paper adds to the small but fundamental body of work on
benchmarking the robustness of DL classifiers on defective images. Unlike
existed single-factor digital perturbation work, we provide state-of-the-art
two-factor perturbation that provides two natural perturbations on images
applied in different sequences. The two-factor perturbation includes (1) two
digital perturbations (Salt & pepper noise and Gaussian noise) applied in both
sequences. (2) one digital perturbation (salt & pepper noise) and a geometric
perturbation (rotation) applied in different sequences. To measure robust DL
classifiers, previous scientists provided 15 types of single-factor corruption.
We created 69 benchmarking image sets, including a clean set, sets with single
factor perturbations, and sets with two-factor perturbation conditions. To be
best of our knowledge, this is the first report that two-factor perturbed
images improves both robustness and accuracy of DL classifiers. Previous
research evaluating deep learning (DL) classifiers has often used top-1/top-5
accuracy, so researchers have usually offered tables, line diagrams, and bar
charts to display accuracy of DL classifiers. But these existed approaches
cannot quantitively evaluate robustness of DL classifiers. We innovate a new
two-dimensional, statistical visualization tool, including mean accuracy and
coefficient of variation (CV), to benchmark the robustness of DL classifiers.

high-resolution aerial imagery. Over the past few years, most studies focus on
classifying an image into one scene category, while in real-world scenarios, it
is more often that a single image contains multiple scenes. Therefore, in this
paper, we investigate a more practical yet underexplored task -- multi-scene
recognition in single images. To this end, we create a large-scale dataset,
called MultiScene, composed of 100,000 unconstrained high-resolution aerial
images. Considering that manually labeling such images is extremely arduous, we
resort to low-cost annotations from crowdsourcing platforms, e.g.,
OpenStreetMap (OSM). However, OSM data might suffer from incompleteness and
incorrectness, which introduce noise into image labels. To address this issue,
we visually inspect 14,000 images and correct their scene labels, yielding a
subset of cleanly-annotated images, named MultiScene-Clean. With it, we can
develop and evaluate deep networks for multi-scene recognition using clean
data. Moreover, we provide crowdsourced annotations of all images for the
purpose of studying network learning with noisy labels. We conduct experiments
with extensive baseline models on both MultiScene-Clean and MultiScene to offer
benchmarks for multi-scene recognition in single images and learning from noisy
labels for this task, respectively. To facilitate progress, we make our dataset

adversarial training can establish a defense to adversarial examples. In
addition, recent studies show that deep neural networks also exhibit
vulnerability to parameter corruptions. The vulnerability of model parameters
is of crucial value to the study of model robustness and generalization. In
this work, we introduce the concept of parameter corruption and propose to
leverage the loss change indicators for measuring the flatness of the loss
basin and the parameter robustness of neural network parameters. On such basis,
we analyze parameter corruptions and propose the multi-step adversarial
corruption algorithm. To enhance neural networks, we propose the adversarial
parameter defense algorithm that minimizes the average risk of multiple
adversarial parameter corruptions. Experimental results show that the proposed
algorithm can improve both the parameter robustness and accuracy of neural

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recursive least squares (RLS) algorithms were once widely used for training
small-scale neural networks, due to their fast convergence. However, previous
RLS algorithms are unsuitable for training deep neural networks (DNNs), since
they have high computational complexity and too many preconditions. In this
paper, to overcome these drawbacks, we propose three novel RLS optimization
algorithms for training feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural
networks and recurrent neural networks (including long short-term memory
networks), by using the error backpropagation and our average-approximation RLS
method, together with the equivalent gradients of the linear least squares loss
function with respect to the linear outputs of hidden layers. Compared with
previous RLS optimization algorithms, our algorithms are simple and elegant.
They can be viewed as an improved stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm,
which uses the inverse autocorrelation matrix of each layer as the adaptive
learning rate. Their time and space complexities are only several times those
of SGD. They only require the loss function to be the mean squared error and
the activation function of the output layer to be invertible. In fact, our
algorithms can be also used in combination with other first-order optimization
algorithms without requiring these two preconditions. In addition, we present
two improved methods for our algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate their
effectiveness compared to the Adam algorithm on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and IMDB
datasets, and investigate the influences of their hyperparameters
experimentally.]]></summary>

towards real-world applications, because ensuring safe exploration or
facilitating adequate exploitation is a challenges for controlling robotic
systems with unknown models and measurement uncertainties. Such a learning
problem becomes even more intractable for complex tasks over continuous space
(state-space and action-space). In this paper, we propose a learning-based
control framework consisting of several aspects: (1) linear temporal logic
(LTL) is leveraged to facilitate complex tasks over an infinite horizons which
can be translated to a novel automaton structure; (2) we propose an innovative
reward scheme for RL-agent with the formal guarantee such that global optimal
policies maximize the probability of satisfying the LTL specifications; (3)
based on a reward shaping technique, we develop a modular policy-gradient
architecture utilizing the benefits of automaton structures to decompose
overall tasks and facilitate the performance of learned controllers; (4) by
incorporating Gaussian Processes (GPs) to estimate the uncertain dynamic
systems, we synthesize a model-based safeguard using Exponential Control
Barrier Functions (ECBFs) to address problems with high-order relative degrees.
In addition, we utilize the properties of LTL automatons and ECBFs to construct
a guiding process to further improve the efficiency of exploration. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework via several robotic
environments. And we show such an ECBF-based modular deep RL algorithm achieves
near-perfect success rates and guard safety with a high probability confidence

techniques that propagate uncertain labels (also called pseudo labels) to large
amounts of unsupervised samples and use them for training the model. However,
these techniques still need hundreds of supervised samples per class in the

iteratively train a deep neural network. Our confidence-based sampling strategy
relies on only dozens of annotated training samples per class with no
validation set, considerably reducing user effort in data annotation. We first
ascertain the best configuration for the baseline -- a self-trained deep neural
network -- and then evaluate our confidence DeepFA for different confidence

When trying to fit a high-dimensional model to data, for example in the

vision-based or machine learning-based. The former approaches typically employ
2-D image analysis/understanding or 3-D point cloud modeling and segmentation
algorithms to detect road potholes from vision sensor data. The latter
approaches generally address road pothole detection using convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) in an end-to-end manner. However, road potholes are not
necessarily ubiquitous and it is challenging to prepare a large well-annotated
dataset for CNN training. In this regard, while computer vision-based methods
were the mainstream research trend in the past decade, machine learning-based
methods were merely discussed. Recently, we published the first stereo
vision-based road pothole detection dataset and a novel disparity
transformation algorithm, whereby the damaged and undamaged road areas can be
highly distinguished. However, there are no benchmarks currently available for
state-of-the-art (SoTA) CNNs trained using either disparity images or
transformed disparity images. Therefore, in this paper, we first discuss the
SoTA CNNs designed for semantic segmentation and evaluate their performance for
road pothole detection with extensive experiments. Additionally, inspired by
graph neural network (GNN), we propose a novel CNN layer, referred to as graph
attention layer (GAL), which can be easily deployed in any existing CNN to
optimize image feature representations for semantic segmentation. Our
experiments compare GAL-DeepLabv3+, our best-performing implementation, with
nine SoTA CNNs on three modalities of training data: RGB images, disparity
images, and transformed disparity images. The experimental results suggest that
our proposed GAL-DeepLabv3+ achieves the best overall pothole detection

important and also challenging in many computer vision tasks. This paper
proposes a simple and effective capsule autoencoder to address this issue,
called DPR-CAE. In our approach, the encoder parses the input into a set of
part capsules, including pose, intensity, and dynamic vector. The decoder
introduces a novel dynamic part representation (DPR) by combining the dynamic
vector and a shared template bank. These part representations are then
regulated by corresponding capsules to composite the final output in an
interpretable way. Besides, an extra translation-invariant module is proposed
to avoid directly learning the uncertain scene-part relationship in our
DPR-CAE, which makes the resulting method achieves a promising performance gain
on $rm$-MNIST and $rm$-Fashion-MNIST. % to model the scene-object relationship
DPR-CAE can be easily combined with the existing stacked capsule autoencoder
and experimental results show it significantly improves performance in terms of
unsupervised object classification. Our code is available in the Appendix.]]></summary>

significantly when retested on adversarial images, imperfect images, or
perturbed images. This paper adds to the small but fundamental body of work on
benchmarking the robustness of DL classifiers on defective images. Unlike
existed single-factor digital perturbation work, we provide state-of-the-art
two-factor perturbation that provides two natural perturbations on images
applied in different sequences. The two-factor perturbation includes (1) two
digital perturbations (Salt & pepper noise and Gaussian noise) applied in both
sequences. (2) one digital perturbation (salt & pepper noise) and a geometric
perturbation (rotation) applied in different sequences. To measure robust DL
classifiers, previous scientists provided 15 types of single-factor corruption.
We created 69 benchmarking image sets, including a clean set, sets with single
factor perturbations, and sets with two-factor perturbation conditions. To be
best of our knowledge, this is the first report that two-factor perturbed
images improves both robustness and accuracy of DL classifiers. Previous
research evaluating deep learning (DL) classifiers has often used top-1/top-5
accuracy, so researchers have usually offered tables, line diagrams, and bar
charts to display accuracy of DL classifiers. But these existed approaches
cannot quantitively evaluate robustness of DL classifiers. We innovate a new
two-dimensional, statistical visualization tool, including mean accuracy and
coefficient of variation (CV), to benchmark the robustness of DL classifiers.

biases such as imbalanced and corrupted labels. Recent methods develop
learning-based algorithms to learn sample re-weighting strategies jointly with
model training based on the frameworks of reinforcement learning and meta
learning. However, depending on additional unbiased reward data is limiting
their general applicability. Furthermore, existing learning-based sample
re-weighting methods require nested optimizations of models and weighting
parameters, which requires expensive second-order computation. This paper
addresses these two problems and presents a novel learning-based fast sample
re-weighting (FSR) method that does not require additional reward data. The
method is based on two key ideas: learning from history to build proxy reward
data and feature sharing to reduce the optimization cost. Our experiments show
the proposed method achieves competitive results compared to state of the arts
on label noise robustness and long-tailed recognition, and does so while

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scene recognition is one of the basic problems in computer vision research
with extensive applications in robotics. When available, depth images provide
helpful geometric cues that complement the RGB texture information and help to
identify discriminative scene image features. Depth sensing technology
developed fast in the last years and a great variety of 3D cameras have been
introduced, each with different acquisition properties. However, those
properties are often neglected when targeting big data collections, so
multi-modal images are gathered disregarding their original nature. In this
work, we put under the spotlight the existence of a possibly severe domain
shift issue within multi-modality scene recognition datasets. As a consequence,
a scene classification model trained on one camera may not generalize on data
from a different camera, only providing a low recognition performance. Starting
from the well-known SUN RGB-D dataset, we designed an experimental testbed to
study this problem and we use it to benchmark the performance of existing
methods. Finally, we introduce a novel adaptive scene recognition approach that
leverages self-supervised translation between modalities. Indeed, learning to
go from RGB to depth and vice-versa is an unsupervised procedure that can be
trained jointly on data of multiple cameras and may help to bridge the gap
among the extracted feature distributions. Our experimental results confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.]]></summary>

aims at localizing temporal intervals containing human actions in untrimmed

process of understanding the video context due to lack of attention mechanism
to express the concept of an action or an agent who performs the action or the
interaction between the agent and the environment. Based on the action
definition that a human, known as an agent, interacts with the environment and
performs an action that affects the environment, we propose a contextual
Agent-Environment Network. Our proposed contextual AEN involves (i) agent
pathway, operating at a local level to tell about which humans/agents are
acting and (ii) environment pathway operating at a global level to tell about
how the agents interact with the environment. Comprehensive evaluations on
20-action THUMOS-14 and 200-action ActivityNet-1.3 datasets with different

recommendations in domains with limited knowledge about user preferences. We
expand the variational autoencoder collaborative filtering from a single-domain
to a multi-domain setting. The intuition is that user-item interactions in a
source domain can augment the recommendation quality in a target domain. The
intuition can be taken to its extreme, where, in a cross-domain setup, the user
history in a source domain is enough to generate high-quality recommendations
in a target one. We thus create a Product-of-Experts (POE) architecture for
recommendations that jointly models user-item interactions across multiple
domains. The method is resilient to missing data for one or more of the
domains, which is a situation often found in real life. We present results on
two widely-used datasets - Amazon and Yelp, which support the claim that
holistic user preference knowledge leads to better recommendations.
Surprisingly, we find that in some cases, a POE recommender that does not
access the target domain user representation can surpass a strong VAE
recommender baseline trained on the target domain.]]></summary>

impressive results on various tasks. To achieve better performance with fewer
trainable parameters, recent methods are proposed to go shallower by parameter
sharing or model compressing along with the depth. However, weak modeling
capacity limits their performance. Contrastively, going wider by inducing more
trainable matrixes and parameters would produce a huge model requiring advanced
parallelism to train and inference.

In this paper, we propose a parameter-efficient framework, going wider
instead of deeper. Specially, following existing works, we adapt parameter
sharing to compress along depth. But, such deployment would limit the
performance. To maximize modeling capacity, we scale along model width by
replacing feed-forward network (FFN) with mixture-of-experts (MoE). Across
transformer blocks, instead of sharing normalization layers, we propose to use
individual layernorms to transform various semantic representations in a more
parameter-efficient way. To evaluate our plug-and-run framework, we design
WideNet and conduct comprehensive experiments on popular computer vision and
natural language processing benchmarks. On ImageNet-1K, our best model
outperforms Vision Transformer (ViT) by $1.5\%$ with $0.72 \times$ trainable
parameters. Using $0.46 \times$ and $0.13 \times$ parameters, our WideNet can
still surpass ViT and ViT-MoE by $0.8\%$ and $2.1\%$, respectively. On four
natural language processing datasets, WideNet outperforms ALBERT by $1.8\%$ on

camera or the partial movement of salient objects. In this paper, we
investigate the complimentary roles of spatial and temporal information and

generator (DWG) is designed to automatically learn the reliability of
corresponding saliency branch. And a top-down cross attentive aggregation (CAA)
procedure is designed so as to facilitate dynamic complementary aggregation of
spatiotemporal features. Finally, the features are modified by spatial
attention with the guidance of coarse saliency map and then go through decoder
part for final saliency map. Experimental results on five benchmarks VOS,

sequences which consist of 3D skeleton joints. While many research work are
devoted to 3D action recognition, it mainly suffers from three problems: highly
complicated articulation, a great amount of noise, and a low implementation
efficiency. To tackle all these problems, we propose a real-time 3D action
recognition framework by integrating the locally aggregated kinematic-guided
skeletonlet (LAKS) with a supervised hashing-by-analysis (SHA) model. We first
define the skeletonlet as a few combinations of joint offsets grouped in terms
of kinematic principle, and then represent an action sequence using LAKS, which
consists of a denoising phase and a locally aggregating phase. The denoising
phase detects the noisy action data and adjust it by replacing all the features
within it with the features of the corresponding previous frame, while the
locally aggregating phase sums the difference between an offset feature of the
skeletonlet and its cluster center together over all the offset features of the
sequence. Finally, the SHA model which combines sparse representation with a
hashing model, aiming at promoting the recognition accuracy while maintaining a
high efficiency. Experimental results on MSRAction3D, UTKinectAction3D and

vision tasks due to its relevant results achieved on many tasks. However, on
real-world scenarios with partially or no labeled data, DL methods are also
prone to the well-known domain shift problem. Multi-source unsupervised domain
adaptation (MSDA) aims at learning a predictor for an unlabeled domain by
assigning weak knowledge from a bag of source models. However, most works
conduct domain adaptation leveraging only the extracted features and reducing
their domain shift from the perspective of loss function designs. In this
paper, we argue that it is not sufficient to handle domain shift only based on
domain-level features, but it is also essential to align such information on
the feature space. Unlike previous works, we focus on the network design and
propose to embed Multi-Source version of DomaIn Alignment Layers (MS-DIAL) at
different levels of the predictor. These layers are designed to match the
feature distributions between different domains and can be easily applied to
various MSDA methods. To show the robustness of our approach, we conducted an
extensive experimental evaluation considering two challenging scenarios: digit
recognition and object classification. The experimental results indicated that
our approach can improve state-of-the-art MSDA methods, yielding relative gains
of up to +30.64% on their classification accuracies.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annotated images are required for both supervised model training and
evaluation in image classification. Manually annotating images is arduous and
expensive, especially for multi-labeled images. A recent trend for conducting
such laboursome annotation tasks is through crowdsourcing, where images are
annotated by volunteers or paid workers online (e.g., workers of Amazon
Mechanical Turk) from scratch. However, the quality of crowdsourcing image
annotations cannot be guaranteed, and incompleteness and incorrectness are two
major concerns for crowdsourcing annotations. To address such concerns, we have
a rethinking of crowdsourcing annotations: Our simple hypothesis is that if the
annotators only partially annotate multi-label images with salient labels they
are confident in, there will be fewer annotation errors and annotators will
spend less time on uncertain labels. As a pleasant surprise, with the same
annotation budget, we show a multi-label image classifier supervised by images
with salient annotations can outperform models supervised by fully annotated
images. Our method contributions are 2-fold: An active learning way is proposed
to acquire salient labels for multi-label images; and a novel Adaptive
Temperature Associated Model (ATAM) specifically using partial annotations is
proposed for multi-label image classification. We conduct experiments on
practical crowdsourcing data, the Open Street Map (OSM) dataset and benchmark
dataset COCO 2014. When compared with state-of-the-art classification methods
trained on fully annotated images, the proposed ATAM can achieve higher
accuracy. The proposed idea is promising for crowdsourcing data annotation. Our
code will be publicly available.]]></summary>

model with the pseudo-masks in fully supervised manner after. However, we find
some matters related to the pseudo-masks, including high quality pseudo-masks
generation from class activation maps (CAMs), and training with noisy
pseudo-mask supervision. For these matters, we propose the following designs to
push the performance to new state-of-art: (i) Coefficient of Variation
Smoothing to smooth the CAMs adaptively; (ii) Proportional Pseudo-mask
Generation to project the expanded CAMs to pseudo-mask based on a new metric
indicating the importance of each class on each location, instead of the scores
trained from binary classifiers. (iii) Pretended Under-Fitting strategy to
suppress the influence of noise in pseudo-mask; (iv) Cyclic Pseudo-mask to
boost the pseudo-masks during training of fully supervised semantic
segmentation (FSSS). Experiments based on our methods achieve new state-of-art
results on two changeling weakly supervised semantic segmentation datasets,

resolutions by encoding pseudo-images sequences of skeletal joints' positions
and processes them with parallel attention modules and atrous convolutions. The
proposed approach is then enhanced by processing features such as relative
distances of skeletal joints, bounding box positions, or ego-vehicle speed with
U-GRUs. Using the newly proposed evaluation procedures for two large public
naturalistic data sets for studying pedestrian behavior in traffic: JAAD and
PIE, we evaluate TrouSPI-Net and analyze its performance. Experimental results
show that TrouSPI-Net achieved 0.76 F1 score on JAAD and 0.80 F1 score on PIE,

compensate for inaccurate pose estimation, we introduce the pose refinement
strategy that updates the initial pose during the learning process, which not

challenging in many machine learning applications. To address this issue, we
introduce a self-adaptive algorithm: the adaptive network enhancement (ANE)
method, written as loops of the form train, estimate and enhance. Starting with
a small two-layer neural network (NN), the step train is to solve the
optimization problem at the current NN; the step estimate is to compute a
posteriori estimator/indicators using the solution at the current NN; the step
enhance is to add new neurons to the current NN.

Novel network enhancement strategies based on the computed
estimator/indicators are developed in this paper to determine how many new
neurons and when a new layer should be added to the current NN. The ANE method
provides a natural process for obtaining a good initialization in training the
current NN; in addition, we introduce an advanced procedure on how to
initialize newly added neurons for a better approximation. We demonstrate that
the ANE method can automatically design a nearly minimal NN for learning
functions exhibiting sharp transitional layers as well as discontinuous

the next state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, each bench-marking their own
performance against that of their predecessors and of their peers.
Unfortunately, the metric used most frequently to describe a model's
performance, average categorization accuracy, is often used in isolation. As
the number of classes increases, such as in fine-grained visual categorization
(FGVC), the amount of information conveyed by average accuracy alone dwindles.
While its most glaring weakness is its failure to describe the model's
performance on a class-by-class basis, average accuracy also fails to describe
how performance may vary from one trained model of the same architecture, on
the same dataset, to another (both averaged across all categories and at the
per-class level). We first demonstrate the magnitude of these variations across
models and across class distributions based on attributes of the data,
comparing results on different visual domains and different per-class image
distributions, including long-tailed distributions and few-shot subsets. We
then analyze the impact various FGVC methods have on overall and per-class
variance. From this analysis, we both highlight the importance of reporting and
comparing methods based on information beyond overall accuracy, as well as
point out techniques that mitigate variance in FGVC results.]]></summary>

generate realistic and diverse sets of outputs. However, existing models suffer
from the key practical limitation of modelling shapes holistically and thus
cannot perform conditional sampling, i.e. they are not able to generate
variants on individual parts of generated shapes without modifying the rest of
the shape. This is limiting for applications such as 3D CAD design that involve
adjusting created shapes at multiple levels of detail. To address this, we
introduce LSD-StructureNet, an augmentation to the StructureNet architecture
that enables re-generation of parts situated at arbitrary positions in the
hierarchies of its outputs. We achieve this by learning individual,
probabilistic conditional decoders for each hierarchy depth. We evaluate
LSD-StructureNet on the PartNet dataset, the largest dataset of 3D shapes
represented by hierarchies of parts. Our results show that contrarily to
existing methods, LSD-StructureNet can perform conditional sampling without
impacting inference speed or the realism and diversity of its outputs.]]></summary>

such as robustness, generalization, transfer, and computational efficiency are
closely related to compression. Prior work has convincingly argued why
minimizing information is useful in the supervised learning setting, but
standard RL algorithms lack an explicit mechanism for compression. The RL
setting is unique because (1) its sequential nature allows an agent to use past
information to avoid looking at future observations and (2) the agent can
optimize its behavior to prefer states where decision making requires few bits.
We take advantage of these properties to propose a method (RPC) for learning
simple policies. This method brings together ideas from information
bottlenecks, model-based RL, and bits-back coding into a simple and
theoretically-justified algorithm. Our method jointly optimizes a latent-space
model and policy to be self-consistent, such that the policy avoids states
where the model is inaccurate. We demonstrate that our method achieves much
tighter compression than prior methods, achieving up to 5x higher reward than a
standard information bottleneck. We also demonstrate that our method learns
policies that are more robust and generalize better to new tasks.]]></summary>

"shallow" parts-based representation, but it clearly fails to discover deep
hierarchical information within both the basis and representation spaces. In
this paper, we technically propose a new enriched prior based Dual-constrained
Deep Semi-Supervised Coupled Factorization Network, called DS2CF-Net, for
learning the hierarchical coupled representations. To ex-tract hidden deep
features, DS2CF-Net is modeled as a deep-structure and geometrical
structure-constrained neural network. Specifically, DS2CF-Net designs a deep
coupled factorization architecture using multi-layers of linear
transformations, which coupled updates the bases and new representations in
each layer. To improve the discriminating ability of learned deep
representations and deep coefficients, our network clearly considers enriching
the supervised prior by the joint deep coefficients-regularized label
prediction, and incorporates enriched prior information as additional label and
structure constraints. The label constraint can enable the samples of the same
label to have the same coordinate in the new feature space, while the structure
constraint forces the coefficient matrices in each layer to be block-diagonal
so that the enhanced prior using the self-expressive label propagation are more
accurate. Our network also integrates the adaptive dual-graph learning to
retain the local manifold structures of both the data manifold and feature
manifold by minimizing the reconstruction errors in each layer. Extensive
experiments on several real databases demonstrate that our DS2CF-Net can obtain
state-of-the-art performance for representation learning and clustering.]]></summary>

because deep neural networks easily overfit label errors. Let X and Y denote

distributions of P(X) and P(Y|X) are entangled. This means that the

causal information to handle the label noise problem. In this paper, by
leveraging a structural causal model, we propose a novel generative approach
for instance-dependent label-noise learning. In particular, we show that
properly modeling the instances will contribute to the identifiability of the

training requires a large amount of labeled sentence pairs, which is not

part due to their pivotal role in machine learning. Variance reduction for
these algorithms has become an important research topic. In contrast to common
approaches, which rarely leverage global models of the objective function, we
exploit convexity and L-smoothness to improve the noisy estimates outputted by
the stochastic gradient oracle. Our method, named COCO denoiser, is the joint
maximum likelihood estimator of multiple function gradients from their noisy
observations, subject to co-coercivity constraints between them. The resulting
estimate is the solution of a convex Quadratically Constrained Quadratic
Problem. Although this problem is expensive to solve by interior point methods,
we exploit its structure to apply an accelerated first-order algorithm, the
Fast Dual Proximal Gradient method. Besides analytically characterizing the
proposed estimator, we show empirically that increasing the number and
proximity of the queried points leads to better gradient estimates. We also
apply COCO in stochastic settings by plugging it in existing algorithms, such
as SGD, Adam or STRSAGA, outperforming their vanilla versions, even in
scenarios where our modelling assumptions are mismatched.]]></summary>

contextual first price auctions. We consider a single bidder (learner) who
repeatedly bids in the first price auctions: at each time $t$, the learner
observes a context $x_t\in \mathbb{R}^d$ and decides the bid based on
historical information and $x_t$. We assume a structured linear model of the
maximum bid of all the others $m_t = \alpha_0\cdot x_t + z_t$, where
$\alpha_0\in \mathbb{R}^d$ is unknown to the learner and $z_t$ is randomly
sampled from a noise distribution $\mathcal{F}$ with log-concave density
function $f$. We consider both \emph{binary feedback} (the learner can only
observe whether she wins or not) and \emph{full information feedback} (the
learner can observe $m_t$) at the end of each time $t$. For binary feedback,
when the noise distribution $\mathcal{F}$ is known, we propose a bidding
algorithm, by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method to achieve at
most $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\log(d) T})$ regret. Moreover, we generalize this
algorithm to the setting with binary feedback and the noise distribution is
unknown but belongs to a parametrized family of distributions. For the full
information feedback with \emph{unknown} noise distribution, we provide an
algorithm that achieves regret at most $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{dT})$. Our approach
combines an estimator for log-concave density functions and then MLE method to
learn the noise distribution $\mathcal{F}$ and linear weight $\alpha_0$
simultaneously. We also provide a lower bound result such that any bidding
policy in a broad class must achieve regret at least $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$, even
when the learner receives the full information feedback and $\mathcal{F}$ is

correcting spurious sample correlations due to hidden confounders in
genome-wide gene expression data. In applications where some confounding
factors are known, estimating simultaneously the contribution of known and
latent variance components in random effect models is a challenge that has so
far relied on numerical gradient-based optimizers to maximize the likelihood
function. This is unsatisfactory because the resulting solution is poorly
characterized and the efficiency of the method may be suboptimal. Here we prove
analytically that maximum-likelihood latent variables can always be chosen
orthogonal to the known confounding factors, in other words, that
maximum-likelihood latent variables explain sample covariances not already
explained by known factors. Based on this result we propose a restricted
maximum-likelihood method which estimates the latent variables by maximizing
the likelihood on the restricted subspace orthogonal to the known confounding
factors, and show that this reduces to probabilistic PCA on that subspace. The
method then estimates the variance-covariance parameters by maximizing the
remaining terms in the likelihood function given the latent variables, using a
newly derived analytic solution for this problem. Compared to gradient-based
optimizers, our method attains greater or equal likelihood values, can be
computed using standard matrix operations, results in latent factors that don't
overlap with any known factors, and has a runtime reduced by several orders of
magnitude. Hence the restricted maximum-likelihood method facilitates the
application of random effect modelling strategies for learning latent variance
components to much larger gene expression datasets than possible with current
methods.]]></summary>

been very successful for training deep learning models, such as neural
networks. Meanwhile, given the need for distributed computing, distributed
optimization algorithms are rapidly becoming a focal point. With the growth of
computing power and the need for using machine learning models on mobile
devices, the communication cost of distributed training algorithms needs
careful consideration. In this paper, we introduce novel convergent
decentralized adaptive gradient methods and rigorously incorporate adaptive
gradient methods into decentralized training procedures. Specifically, we
propose a general algorithmic framework that can convert existing adaptive
gradient methods to their decentralized counterparts. In addition, we
thoroughly analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithmic
framework and show that if a given adaptive gradient method converges, under
some specific conditions, then its decentralized counterpart is also
convergent. We illustrate the benefit of our generic decentralized framework on
a prototype method, i.e., AMSGrad, both theoretically and numerically.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The role of social media in opinion formation has far-reaching implications
in all spheres of society. Though social media provide platforms for expressing
news and views, it is hard to control the quality of posts due to the sheer
volumes of posts on platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Misinformation and
rumours have lasting effects on society, as they tend to influence people's
opinions and also may motivate people to act irrationally. It is therefore very
important to detect and remove rumours from these platforms. The only way to
prevent the spread of rumours is through automatic detection and classification
of social media posts. Our focus in this paper is the Twitter social medium, as
it is relatively easy to collect data from Twitter. The majority of previous
studies used supervised learning approaches to classify rumours on Twitter.
These approaches rely on feature extraction to obtain both content and context
features from the text of tweets to distinguish rumours and non-rumours.
Manually extracting features however is time-consuming considering the volume
of tweets. We propose a novel approach to deal with this problem by utilising
sentence embedding using BERT to identify rumours on Twitter, rather than the
usual feature extraction techniques. We use sentence embedding using BERT to
represent each tweet's sentences into a vector according to the contextual
meaning of the tweet. We classify those vectors into rumours or non-rumours by
using various supervised learning techniques. Our BERT based models improved
the accuracy by approximately 10% as compared to previous methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An emerging trend in audio processing is capturing low-level speech
representations from raw waveforms. These representations have shown promising
results on a variety of tasks, such as speech recognition and speech
separation. Compared to handcrafted features, learning speech features via
backpropagation provides the model greater flexibility in how it represents
data for different tasks theoretically. However, results from empirical study
shows that, in some tasks, such as voice spoof detection, handcrafted features
are more competitive than learned features. Instead of evaluating handcrafted
features and raw waveforms independently, this paper proposes an Auxiliary
Rawnet model to complement handcrafted features with features learned from raw
waveforms. A key benefit of the approach is that it can improve accuracy at a
relatively low computational cost. The proposed Auxiliary Rawnet model is
tested using the ASVspoof 2019 dataset and the results from this dataset
indicate that a light-weight waveform encoder can potentially boost the
performance of handcrafted-features-based encoders in exchange for a small
amount of additional computational work.]]></summary>

terms which are terms characterizing a specific group of people such as

propose a novel approach to tackle such bias in toxic comment classification,
leveraging the notion of subjectivity level of a comment and the presence of

comment being toxic is associated with the subjectivity level of the comment,
i.e. the extent to which the comment conveys personal feelings and opinions.
Building upon the BERT model, we propose a new structure that is able to
leverage these features, and thoroughly evaluate our model on 4 datasets of
varying sizes and representing different social media platforms. The results
show that our model can consistently outperform BERT and a SOTA model devised

both single-point- as well as group- anomalies? We are the first to generalize
anomaly detection in two dimensions: The first dimension is that we handle both
point-anomalies, as well as group-anomalies, under a unified view -- we shall
refer to them as generalized anomalies. The second dimension is that gen2Out
not only detects, but also ranks, anomalies in suspiciousness order. Detection,
and ranking, of anomalies has numerous applications: For example, in EEG
recordings of an epileptic patient, an anomaly may indicate a seizure; in
computer network traffic data, it may signify a power failure, or a DoS/DDoS
attack. We start by setting some reasonable axioms; surprisingly, none of the
earlier methods pass all the axioms. Our main contribution is the gen2Out
algorithm, that has the following desirable properties: (a) Principled and
Sound anomaly scoring that obeys the axioms for detectors, (b) Doubly-general
in that it detects, as well as ranks generalized anomaly -- both point- and
group-anomalies, (c) Scalable, it is fast and scalable, linear on input size.
(d) Effective, experiments on real-world epileptic recordings (200GB)
demonstrate effectiveness of gen2Out as confirmed by clinicians. Experiments on
27 real-world benchmark datasets show that gen2Out detects ground truth groups,
matches or outperforms point-anomaly baseline algorithms on accuracy, with no
competition for group-anomalies and requires about 2 minutes for 1 million data

locate robustly and well due to their low amplitudes and high frequencies
usually obscured by heterogeneous noise sources. They highlight crucial
information about the stress state and the spatio-temporal behavior of fault
systems during the earthquake cycle, therefore, its full characterization is
then crucial for improving earthquake hazard assessment. Modern DL algorithms
along with the increasing computational power are exploiting the continuously
growing seismological databases, allowing scientists to improve the
completeness for earthquake catalogs, systematically detecting smaller
magnitude earthquakes and reducing the errors introduced mainly by human
intervention. In this work, we introduce OKSP, a novel automatic earthquake
detection pipeline for seismic monitoring in Costa Rica. Using Kabre
supercomputer from the Costa Rica High Technology Center, we applied OKSP to
the day before and the first 5 days following the Puerto Armuelles, M6.5,
earthquake that occurred on 26 June, 2019, along the Costa Rica-Panama border
and found 1100 more earthquakes previously unidentified by the Volcanological
and Seismological Observatory of Costa Rica. From these events, a total of 23
earthquakes with magnitudes below 1.0 occurred a day to hours prior to the
mainshock, shedding light about the rupture initiation and earthquake
interaction leading to the occurrence of this productive seismic sequence. Our
observations show that for the study period, the model was 100% exhaustive and
82% precise, resulting in an F1 score of 0.90. This effort represents the very

learning methods and demonstrates that, in the near future, earthquake
monitoring routines will be carried out entirely by AI algorithms.]]></summary>

currently estimated that the smart speaker adoption rate has exceeded 35% in
the US adult population. Manufacturers have integrated speaker identification
technology, which attempts to determine the identity of the person speaking, to
provide personalized services to different members of the same family. Speaker
identification can also play an important role in controlling how the smart
speaker is used. For example, it is not critical to correctly identify the user
when playing music. However, when reading the user's email out loud, it is
critical to correctly verify the speaker that making the request is the
authorized user. Speaker verification systems, which authenticate the speaker
identity, are therefore needed as a gatekeeper to protect against various
spoofing attacks that aim to impersonate the enrolled user. This paper compares
popular learnable front-ends which learn the representations of audio by joint
training with downstream tasks (End-to-End). We categorize the front-ends by
defining two generic architectures and then analyze the filtering stages of
both types in terms of learning constraints. We propose replacing fixed
filterbanks with a learnable layer that can better adapt to anti-spoofing
tasks. The proposed FastAudio front-end is then tested with two popular
back-ends to measure the performance on the LA track of the ASVspoof 2019
dataset. The FastAudio front-end achieves a relative improvement of 27% when
compared with fixed front-ends, outperforming all other learnable front-ends on
this task.]]></summary>

complexities cursed by the data dimension and therefore cannot well explain the
empirical success of deep learning on high-dimensional data. To bridge this
gap, we propose to exploit low-dimensional geometric structures of the real
world data sets. We establish theoretical guarantees of convolutional residual
networks (ConvResNet) in terms of function approximation and statistical
estimation for binary classification. Specifically, given the data lying on a
$d$-dimensional manifold isometrically embedded in $\mathbb{R}^D$, we prove
that if the network architecture is properly chosen, ConvResNets can (1)
approximate Besov functions on manifolds with arbitrary accuracy, and (2) learn
a classifier by minimizing the empirical logistic risk, which gives an excess
risk in the order of $n^{-\frac{s}{2s+2(s\vee d)}}$, where $s$ is a smoothness
parameter. This implies that the sample complexity depends on the intrinsic
dimension $d$, instead of the data dimension $D$. Our results demonstrate that
ConvResNets are adaptive to low-dimensional structures of data sets.]]></summary>

learning. The proposed approach alternates between (1) learning an ensemble of
models using a parametric version of the Random Subspace approach, in which
feature subsets are sampled according to Bernoulli distributions, and (2)
identifying the parameters of the Bernoulli distributions that minimize the
generalization error of the ensemble model. Parameter optimization is rendered
tractable by using an importance sampling approach able to estimate the
expected model output for any given parameter set, without the need to learn
new models. While the degree of randomization is controlled by a
hyper-parameter in standard Random Subspace, it has the advantage to be
automatically tuned in our parametric version. Furthermore, model-agnostic
feature importance scores can be easily derived from the trained ensemble
model. We show the good performance of the proposed approach, both in terms of
prediction and feature ranking, on simulated and real-world datasets. We also
show that our approach can be successfully used for the reconstruction of gene
regulatory networks.]]></summary>

time such that the model correctly classifies all standard inputs, but

trigger. In this paper, we present the first ultra light-weight and highly
effective trojan detection method that does not require access to the
training/test data, does not involve any expensive computations, and makes no
assumptions on the nature of the trojan trigger. Our approach focuses on
analysis of the weights of the final, linear layer of the network. We
empirically demonstrate several characteristics of these weights that occur
frequently in trojaned networks, but not in benign networks. In particular, we
show that the distribution of the weights associated with the trojan target
class is clearly distinguishable from the weights associated with other
classes. Using this, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed detection
method against state-of-the-art attacks across a variety of architectures,

management and traffic system operation. There exist a large body of works on
modeling location sequence and predicting the next location of users; however,
little attention is paid to the prediction of the next trip, which is governed
by the strong spatiotemporal dependencies between diverse attributes, including
trip start time $t$, origin $o$, and destination $d$. To fill this gap, in this
paper we propose a novel point process-based model -- Attentive Marked temporal
point processes (AMTPP) -- to model human mobility and predict the whole trip
$(t,o,d)$ in a joint manner. To encode the influence of history trips, AMTPP
employs the self-attention mechanism with a carefully designed positional
embedding to capture the daily/weekly periodicity and regularity in individual
travel behavior. Given the unique peaked nature of inter-event time in human
behavior, we use an asymmetric log-Laplace mixture distribution to precisely
model the distribution of trip start time $t$. Furthermore, an
origin-destination (OD) matrix learning block is developed to model the
relationship between every origin and destination pair. Experimental results on
two large metro trip datasets demonstrate the superior performance of AMTPP.]]></summary>

solving nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) problems under the separability
assumption. Separable NMFs have important applications, such as topic
extraction from documents and unmixing of hyperspectral images. In such
applications, the robustness of the algorithm to noise is the key to the
success. Hottopixx has been shown to be robust to noise, and its robustness can
be further enhanced through postprocessing. However, there is a drawback.
Hottopixx and its postprocessing require us to estimate the noise level
involved in the matrix we want to factorize before running, since they use it
as part of the input data. The noise-level estimation is not an easy task. In
this paper, we overcome this drawback. We present a refinement of Hottopixx and
its postprocessing that runs without prior knowledge of the noise level. We
show that the refinement has almost the same robustness to noise as the
original algorithm.]]></summary>

has given rise to the increased usage of channels like virtual assistants.
Typically, customers try to get their questions answered by low-touch channels
like search and virtual assistant first, before getting in touch with a live
chat agent or the phone representative. Higher usage of these low-touch systems
is a win-win for both customers and the organization since it enables
organizations to attain a low cost of service while customers get served
without delay. In this paper, we propose a two-part framework where the first
part describes methods to combine the information from different interaction
channels like call, search, and chat. We do this by summarizing (using a
stacked Bi-LSTM network) the high-touch interaction channel data such as call
and chat into short searchquery like customer intents and then creating an
organically grown intent taxonomy from interaction data (using Hierarchical
Agglomerative Clustering). The second part of the framework focuses on
extracting customer questions by analyzing interaction data sources. It
calculates similarity scores using TF-IDF and BERT(Devlin et al., 2019). It
also maps these identified questions to the output of the first part of the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sequential diagnosis prediction on the Electronic Health Record (EHR) has
been proven crucial for predictive analytics in the medical domain. EHR data,
sequential records of a patient's interactions with healthcare systems, has
numerous inherent characteristics of temporality, irregularity and data
insufficiency. Some recent works train healthcare predictive models by making
use of sequential information in EHR data, but they are vulnerable to
irregular, temporal EHR data with the states of admission/discharge from
hospital, and insufficient data. To mitigate this, we propose an end-to-end
robust transformer-based model called SETOR, which exploits neural ordinary
differential equation to handle both irregular intervals between a patient's
visits with admitted timestamps and length of stay in each visit, to alleviate
the limitation of insufficient data by integrating medical ontology, and to
capture the dependencies between the patient's visits by employing multi-layer
transformer blocks. Experiments conducted on two real-world healthcare datasets
show that, our sequential diagnoses prediction model SETOR not only achieves
better predictive results than previous state-of-the-art approaches,
irrespective of sufficient or insufficient training data, but also derives more
interpretable embeddings of medical codes. The experimental codes are available
at the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Xueping/SETOR).]]></summary>

applications of near-term quantum devices. Pioneer theoretical works suggest
that quantum generative adversarial networks (GANs) may exhibit a potential
exponential advantage over classical GANs, thus attracting widespread
attention. However, it remains elusive whether quantum GANs implemented on
near-term quantum devices can actually solve real-world learning tasks. Here,
we devise a flexible quantum GAN scheme to narrow this knowledge gap, which
could accomplish image generation with arbitrarily high-dimensional features,
and could also take advantage of quantum superposition to train multiple
examples in parallel. For the first time, we experimentally achieve the
learning and generation of real-world hand-written digit images on a
superconducting quantum processor. Moreover, we utilize a gray-scale bar
dataset to exhibit the competitive performance between quantum GANs and the
classical GANs based on multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural network
architectures, respectively, benchmarked by the Fr\'echet Distance score. Our
work provides guidance for developing advanced quantum generative models on

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) bring the power of deep representation learning
to graph and relational data and achieve state-of-the-art performance in many
applications. GNNs compute node representations by taking into account the
topology of the node's ego-network and the features of the ego-network's nodes.
When the nodes do not have high-quality features, GNNs learn an embedding layer
to compute node embeddings and use them as input features. However, the size of
the embedding layer is linear to the product of the number of nodes in the
graph and the dimensionality of the embedding and does not scale to big data
and graphs with hundreds of millions of nodes. To reduce the memory associated
with this embedding layer, hashing-based approaches, commonly used in
applications like NLP and recommender systems, can potentially be used.
However, a direct application of these ideas fails to exploit the fact that in
many real-world graphs, nodes that are topologically close will tend to be
related to each other (homophily) and as such their representations will be
similar.

In this work, we present approaches that take advantage of the nodes'
position in the graph to dramatically reduce the memory required, with minimal
if any degradation in the quality of the resulting GNN model. Our approaches
decompose a node's embedding into two components: a position-specific component
and a node-specific component. The position-specific component models homophily
and the node-specific component models the node-to-node variation. Extensive
experiments using different datasets and GNN models show that our methods are
able to reduce the memory requirements by 88% to 97% while achieving, in nearly
all cases, better classification accuracy than other competing approaches,
including the full embeddings.]]></summary>

understanding of biological structures in fluorescence microscopy images.
Existing automated nuclei localization methods face three main challenges: (1)
Most of object detection methods work only on 2D images and are difficult to
extend to 3D volumes; (2) Segmentation-based models can be used on 3D volumes
but it is computational expensive for large microscopy volumes and they have
difficulty distinguishing different instances of objects; (3) Hand annotated
ground truth is limited for 3D microscopy volumes. To address these issues, we
present a scalable approach for nuclei centroid detection of 3D microscopy
volumes. We describe the RCNN-SliceNet to detect 2D nuclei centroids for each
slice of the volume from different directions and 3D agglomerative hierarchical
clustering (AHC) is used to estimate the 3D centroids of nuclei in a volume.
The model was trained with the synthetic microscopy data generated using
Spatially Constrained Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (SpCycleGAN) and
tested on different types of real 3D microscopy data. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method can accurately count and detect
the nuclei centroids in a 3D microscopy volume.]]></summary>

Benefit from the self-attention module, transformer architectures have shown

the existing knowledge distillation approaches, we propose to excavate useful
information from the teacher transformer through the relationship between
images and the divided patches. We then explore an efficient fine-grained
manifold distillation approach that simultaneously calculates cross-images,
cross-patch, and random-selected manifolds in teacher and student models.
Experimental results conducted on several benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed algorithm for distilling portable transformer
models with higher performance. For example, our approach achieves 75.06% Top-1

impressive results on various tasks. To achieve better performance with fewer
trainable parameters, recent methods are proposed to go shallower by parameter
sharing or model compressing along with the depth. However, weak modeling
capacity limits their performance. Contrastively, going wider by inducing more
trainable matrixes and parameters would produce a huge model requiring advanced
parallelism to train and inference.

In this paper, we propose a parameter-efficient framework, going wider
instead of deeper. Specially, following existing works, we adapt parameter
sharing to compress along depth. But, such deployment would limit the
performance. To maximize modeling capacity, we scale along model width by
replacing feed-forward network (FFN) with mixture-of-experts (MoE). Across
transformer blocks, instead of sharing normalization layers, we propose to use
individual layernorms to transform various semantic representations in a more
parameter-efficient way. To evaluate our plug-and-run framework, we design
WideNet and conduct comprehensive experiments on popular computer vision and
natural language processing benchmarks. On ImageNet-1K, our best model
outperforms Vision Transformer (ViT) by $1.5\%$ with $0.72 \times$ trainable
parameters. Using $0.46 \times$ and $0.13 \times$ parameters, our WideNet can
still surpass ViT and ViT-MoE by $0.8\%$ and $2.1\%$, respectively. On four
natural language processing datasets, WideNet outperforms ALBERT by $1.8\%$ on

challenging problem for current recommendation systems. Various methods have
been proposed to address it via leveraging the advantages of graph neural
networks (GNNs) or multi-task learning. However, most existing works do not
take the complex dependencies among different behaviors of users into
consideration. They utilize simple and fixed schemes, like neighborhood
information aggregation or mathematical calculation of vectors, to fuse the
embeddings of different user behaviors to obtain a unified embedding to
represent a user's behavioral patterns which will be used in downstream
recommendation tasks. To tackle the challenge, in this paper, we first propose
the concept of hyper meta-path to construct hyper meta-paths or hyper
meta-graphs to explicitly illustrate the dependencies among different behaviors
of a user. How to obtain a unified embedding for a user from hyper meta-paths
and avoid the previously mentioned limitations simultaneously is critical.
Thanks to the recent success of graph contrastive learning, we leverage it to
learn embeddings of user behavior patterns adaptively instead of assigning a
fixed scheme to understand the dependencies among different behaviors. A new
graph contrastive learning based framework is proposed by coupling with hyper
meta-paths, namely HMG-CR, which consistently and significantly outperforms all
baselines in extensive comparison experiments.]]></summary>

Specifically, we advocate a zero-shot setting, where models from
self-supervised learning should be directly applicable for the downstream task,
without using any manual annotations whatsoever. We make the following
contributions. First, with careful examination on existing self-supervised
learning approaches, we reveal the surprising result that, given suitable data
augmentation, models trained from scratch in fact achieve comparable
performance to those pre-trained with self-supervised learning. Second,
inspired by the fact that tumors tend to be characterized independently to the
contexts, we propose a scalable pipeline for generating synthetic tumor data,
and train a self-supervised model that minimises the generalisation gap with
the downstream task. Third, we conduct extensive ablation studies on different
downstream datasets, BraTS2018 for brain tumor segmentation and LiTS2017 for
liver tumor segmentation. While evaluating the model transferability for tumor
segmentation under a low-annotation regime, including an extreme case of
zero-shot segmentation, the proposed approach demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance, substantially outperforming all existing self-supervised
approaches, and opening up the usage of self-supervised learning in practical

approach is to pre-train a model on synthetic data and then fine-tune on real
shapes using slow, unstable reinforcement learning. In this paper, we argue
that self-training is a viable alternative for fine-tuning such models.
Self-training is a semi-supervised learning paradigm where a model assigns
pseudo-labels to unlabeled data, and then retrains with (data, pseudo-label)
pairs as the new ground truth. We show that for constructive solid geometry and
assembly-based modeling, self-training outperforms state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning approaches. Additionally, shape program inference has a
unique property that circumvents a potential downside of self-training
(incorrect pseudo-label assignment): inferred programs are executable. For a
given shape from our distribution of interest $\mathbf{x}^*$ and its predicted
program $\mathbf{z}$, one can execute $\mathbf{z}$ to obtain a shape
$\mathbf{x}$ and train on $(\mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x})$ pairs, rather than
$(\mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x}^*)$ pairs. We term this procedure latent execution
self training (LEST). We demonstrate that self training infers shape programs
with higher shape reconstruction accuracy and converges significantly faster
than reinforcement learning approaches, and in some domains, LEST can further
improve this performance.]]></summary>

advances in video processing to detect and monitor traffic incidents. The
collected data are traditionally forwarded to the traffic management center
(TMC) for in-depth analysis and may thus exacerbate the network paths to the
TMC. To alleviate such bottlenecks, we propose to utilize edge computing by
equipping edge nodes that are close to cameras with computing resources (e.g.
cloudlets). A cloudlet, with limited computing resources as compared to TMC,
provides limited video processing capabilities. In this paper, we focus on two
common traffic monitoring tasks, congestion detection, and speed detection, and
propose a two-tier edge computing based model that takes into account of both
the limited computing capability in cloudlets and the unstable network
condition to the TMC. Our solution utilizes two algorithms for each task, one
implemented at the edge and the other one at the TMC, which are designed with
the consideration of different computing resources. While the TMC provides
strong computation power, the video quality it receives depends on the
underlying network conditions. On the other hand, the edge processes very
high-quality video but with limited computing resources. Our model captures
this trade-off. We evaluate the performance of the proposed two-tier model as
well as the traffic monitoring algorithms via test-bed experiments under
different weather as well as network conditions and show that our proposed
hybrid edge-cloud solution outperforms both the cloud-only and edge-only
solutions.]]></summary>

promising results in recent years. However, they tend to introduce multiple
tunable hyper-parameters, making them less practical in real SSL scenarios
where the labeled data is scarce for extensive hyper-parameter search. In this
paper, we propose a novel meta-learning based SSL algorithm (Meta-Semi) that
requires tuning only one additional hyper-parameter, compared with a standard
supervised deep learning algorithm, to achieve competitive performance under
various conditions of SSL. We start by defining a meta optimization problem
that minimizes the loss on labeled data through dynamically reweighting the
loss on unlabeled samples, which are associated with soft pseudo labels during
training. As the meta problem is computationally intensive to solve directly,
we propose an efficient algorithm to dynamically obtain the approximate
solutions. We show theoretically that Meta-Semi converges to the stationary
point of the loss function on labeled data under mild conditions. Empirically,
Meta-Semi outperforms state-of-the-art SSL algorithms significantly on the

different types of nodes and connections. Heterogeneous graph neural network
model aims to embed nodes or subgraphs into low-dimensional vector space for
various downstream tasks such as node classification, link prediction, etc.
Although several models were proposed recently, they either only aggregate
information from the same type of neighbors, or just indiscriminately treat
homogeneous and heterogeneous neighbors in the same way. Based on these
observations, we propose a new heterogeneous graph neural network model named
HMSG to comprehensively capture structural, semantic and attribute information
from both homogeneous and heterogeneous neighbors. Specifically, we first
decompose the heterogeneous graph into multiple metapath-based homogeneous and
heterogeneous subgraphs, and each subgraph associates specific semantic and
structural information. Then message aggregation methods are applied to each
subgraph independently, so that information can be learned in a more targeted
and efficient manner. Through a type-specific attribute transformation, node
attributes can also be transferred among different types of nodes. Finally, we
fuse information from subgraphs together to get the complete representation.
Extensive experiments on several datasets for node classification, node
clustering and link prediction tasks show that HMSG achieves the best
performance in all evaluation metrics than state-of-the-art baselines.]]></summary>

extract vital signs of the human body. Although it has been widely used in
consumer and research grade wrist devices to track a user's physiology, the PPG
signal is very sensitive to motion which can corrupt the signal's quality.
Existing Motion Artifact (MA) reduction techniques have been developed and
evaluated using either synthetic noisy signals or signals collected during
high-intensity activities - both of which are difficult to generalize for
real-life scenarios. Therefore, it is valuable to collect realistic PPG signals
while performing Activities of Daily Living (ADL) to develop practical signal
denoising and analysis methods. In this work, we propose an automatic pseudo
clean PPG generation process for reliable PPG signal selection. For each noisy
PPG segment, the corresponding pseudo clean PPG reduces the MAs and contains
rich temporal details depicting cardiac features. Our experimental results show
that 71% of the pseudo clean PPG collected from ADL can be considered as high
quality segment where the derived MAE of heart rate and respiration rate are
1.46 BPM and 3.93 BrPM, respectively. Therefore, our proposed method can
determine the reliability of the raw noisy PPG by considering quality of the
corresponding pseudo clean PPG signal.]]></summary>

the pre-trained multi-modal model CLIP by training a text-based image

generate some candidate unknown class names for each test sample and computes a

for tracking prosodic and spectrotemporal patterns in real-life that are
indicative of emotional changes, providing a valuable window into one's
cognitive and mental state. Yet, the scarcity of labelled data in ambulatory
studies prevents the reliable training of ML models, which usually rely on
"data-hungry" distribution-based learning. Leveraging the abundance of labelled
speech data from acted emotions, this paper proposes a few-shot learning
approach for automatically recognizing emotion in spontaneous speech from a
small number of labelled samples. Few-shot learning is implemented via a metric
learning approach through a siamese neural network, which models the relative
distance between samples rather than relying on learning absolute patterns of
the corresponding distributions of each emotion. Results indicate the
feasibility of the proposed metric learning in recognizing emotions from
spontaneous speech in four datasets, even with a small amount of labelled
samples. They further demonstrate superior performance of the proposed metric
learning compared to commonly used adaptation methods, including network
fine-tuning and adversarial learning. Findings from this work provide a

Most of previous FSL approaches resort to the meta-learning paradigm, where the
model accumulates inductive bias through learning many training tasks so as to
solve a new unseen few-shot task. In contrast, we propose a simple approach to
exploit unlabeled data accompanying the few-shot task for improving few-shot
performance. Firstly, we propose a Dependency Maximization method based on the
Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the cross-covariance operator, which maximizes the
statistical dependency between the embedded feature of those unlabeled data and
their label predictions, together with the supervised loss over the support
set. We then use the obtained model to infer the pseudo-labels for those
unlabeled data. Furthermore, we propose anInstance Discriminant Analysis to
evaluate the credibility of each pseudo-labeled example and select the most
faithful ones into an augmented support set to retrain the model as in the
first step. We iterate the above process until the pseudo-labels for the
unlabeled data becomes stable. Following the standard transductive and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in various
computer vision tasks, they often fail to generalize to new domains and subtle
variations of input images. Several defenses have been proposed to improve the
robustness against these variations. However, current defenses can only
withstand the specific attack used in training, and the models often remain
vulnerable to other input variations. Moreover, these methods often degrade
performance of the model on clean images and do not generalize to out-of-domain
samples. In this paper we present Generative Adversarial Training, an approach
to simultaneously improve the model's generalization to the test set and
out-of-domain samples as well as its robustness to unseen adversarial attacks.
Instead of altering a low-level pre-defined aspect of images, we generate a
spectrum of low-level, mid-level and high-level changes using generative models
with a disentangled latent space. Adversarial training with these examples
enable the model to withstand a wide range of attacks by observing a variety of
input alterations during training. We show that our approach not only improves
performance of the model on clean images and out-of-domain samples but also
makes it robust against unforeseen attacks and outperforms prior work. We
validate effectiveness of our method by demonstrating results on various tasks
such as classification, segmentation and object detection.]]></summary>

interference fringes in elliptical antinode regions in frames of high-speed
video recordings of transient oscillations in Caribbean steelpan drums
illuminated by electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI). The
annotations provided by our model aim to contribute to the understanding of
time-dependent behavior in such drums by tracking the development of
sympathetic vibration modes. The system is trained on a dataset of crowdsourced
human-annotated images obtained from the Zooniverse Steelpan Vibrations
Project. Due to the small number of human-annotated images and the ambiguity of
the annotation task, we also evaluate the model on a large corpus of synthetic
images whose properties have been matched to the real images by style transfer
using a Generative Adversarial Network. Applying the model to thousands of
unlabeled video frames, we measure oscillations consistent with audio
recordings of these drum strikes. One unanticipated result is that sympathetic
oscillations of higher-octave notes significantly precede the rise in sound
intensity of the corresponding second harmonic tones; the mechanism responsible

segmentation. The performance of 3D CNNs is greatly influenced by the dataset
while the public airway datasets are mainly clean CT scans with coarse
annotation, thus difficult to be generalized to noisy CT scans (e.g. COVID-19
CT scans). In this work, we proposed a new dual-stream network to address the
variability between the clean domain and noisy domain, which utilizes the clean
CT scans and a small amount of labeled noisy CT scans for airway segmentation.
We designed two different encoders to extract the transferable clean features
and the unique noisy features separately, followed by two independent decoders.
Further on, the transferable features are refined by the channel-wise feature
recalibration and Signed Distance Map (SDM) regression. The feature
recalibration module emphasizes critical features and the SDM pays more
attention to the bronchi, which is beneficial to extracting the transferable
topological features robust to the coarse labels. Extensive experimental
results demonstrated the obvious improvement brought by our proposed method.
Compared to other state-of-the-art transfer learning methods, our method
accurately segmented more bronchi in the noisy CT scans.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prediction of Overall Survival (OS) of brain cancer patients from multi-modal
MRI is a challenging field of research. Most of the existing literature on
survival prediction is based on Radiomic features, which does not consider
either non-biological factors or the functional neurological status of the
patient(s). Besides, the selection of an appropriate cut-off for survival and
the presence of censored data create further problems. Application of deep
learning models for OS prediction is also limited due to the lack of large
annotated publicly available datasets. In this scenario we analyse the
potential of two novel neuroimaging feature families, extracted from brain
parcellation atlases and spatial habitats, along with classical radiomic and
geometric features; to study their combined predictive power for analysing
overall survival. A cross validation strategy with grid search is proposed to
simultaneously select and evaluate the most predictive feature subset based on
its predictive power. A Cox Proportional Hazard (CoxPH) model is employed for
univariate feature selection, followed by the prediction of patient-specific
survival functions by three multivariate parsimonious models viz. Coxnet,
Random survival forests (RSF) and Survival SVM (SSVM). The brain cancer MRI
data used for this research was taken from two open-access collections TCGA-GBM
and TCGA-LGG available from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Corresponding
survival data for each patient was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA). A high cross validation $C-index$ score of $0.82\pm.10$ was achieved
using RSF with the best $24$ selected features. Age was found to be the most
important biological predictor. There were $9$, $6$, $6$ and $2$ features
selected from the parcellation, habitat, radiomic and region-based feature
groups respectively.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kinship verification is a long-standing research challenge in computer
vision. The visual differences presented to the face have a significant effect
on the recognition capabilities of the kinship systems. We argue that
aggregating multiple visual knowledge can better describe the characteristics
of the subject for precise kinship identification. Typically, the age-invariant
features can represent more natural facial details. Such age-related
transformations are essential for face recognition due to the biological
effects of aging. However, the existing methods mainly focus on employing the
single-view image features for kinship identification, while more meaningful
visual properties such as race and age are directly ignored in the feature
learning step. To this end, we propose a novel deep collaborative multi-modal
learning (DCML) to integrate the underlying information presented in facial
properties in an adaptive manner to strengthen the facial details for effective
unsupervised kinship verification. Specifically, we construct a well-designed
adaptive feature fusion mechanism, which can jointly leverage the complementary
properties from different visual perspectives to produce composite features and
draw greater attention to the most informative components of spatial feature
maps. Particularly, an adaptive weighting strategy is developed based on a
novel attention mechanism, which can enhance the dependencies between different
properties by decreasing the information redundancy in channels in a
self-adaptive manner. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method,
extensive experimental evaluations conducted on four widely-used datasets show
that our DCML method is always superior to some state-of-the-art kinship
verification methods.]]></summary>

disadvantageous. We demonstrate that these assumptions are not necessarily
valid. In our experiments, training on only African faces induced less bias
than training on a balanced distribution of faces and distributions skewed to
include more African faces produced more equitable models. We additionally
notice that adding more images of existing identities to a dataset in place of
adding new identities can lead to accuracy boosts across racial categories. Our

which only activate and cause misclassifications on model inputs containing a
specific trigger. Existing works on backdoor attacks and defenses, however,
mostly focus on digital attacks that use digitally generated patterns as
triggers. A critical question remains unanswered: can backdoor attacks succeed
using physical objects as triggers, thus making them a credible threat against
deep learning systems in the real world? We conduct a detailed empirical study
to explore this question for facial recognition, a critical deep learning task.
Using seven physical objects as triggers, we collect a custom dataset of 3205
images of ten volunteers and use it to study the feasibility of physical
backdoor attacks under a variety of real-world conditions. Our study reveals
two key findings. First, physical backdoor attacks can be highly successful if
they are carefully configured to overcome the constraints imposed by physical
objects. In particular, the placement of successful triggers is largely
constrained by the target model's dependence on key facial features. Second,
four of today's state-of-the-art defenses against (digital) backdoors are
ineffective against physical backdoors, because the use of physical objects
breaks core assumptions used to construct these defenses. Our study confirms
that (physical) backdoor attacks are not a hypothetical phenomenon but rather
pose a serious real-world threat to critical classification tasks. We need new

constructed into a bucket signal array, which is regarded as the sample of GAN.
Then, conditional GAN is used to map bucket signal array and target category.
In practical application, the speckles sequence in training step is employed to
illuminate target, and the bucket signal array is input GAN for recognition.
The proposed method can improve the problems caused by conventional recognition

in the multimedia field. This paper proposes a new task of sensor-augmented
egocentric-video captioning, a newly constructed dataset for it called MMAC
Captions, and a method for the newly proposed task that effectively utilizes
multi-modal data of video and motion sensors, or inertial measurement units
(IMUs). While conventional video captioning tasks have difficulty in dealing
with detailed descriptions of human activities due to the limited view of a
fixed camera, egocentric vision has greater potential to be used for generating
the finer-grained descriptions of human activities on the basis of a much
closer view. In addition, we utilize wearable-sensor data as auxiliary
information to mitigate the inherent problems in egocentric vision: motion
blur, self-occlusion, and out-of-camera-range activities. We propose a method
for effectively utilizing the sensor data in combination with the video data on
the basis of an attention mechanism that dynamically determines the modality
that requires more attention, taking the contextual information into account.
We compared the proposed sensor-fusion method with strong baselines on the MMAC
Captions dataset and found that using sensor data as supplementary information
to the egocentric-video data was beneficial, and that our proposed method
outperformed the strong baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed method.]]></summary>

security and privacy issues. Attackers can easily impersonate a person's
identity in an image by replacing his face with the target person's face.
Moreover, a new domain of cloning human voices using deep-learning technologies
is also emerging. Now, an attacker can generate realistic cloned voices of
humans using only a few seconds of audio of the target person. With the
emerging threat of potential harm deepfakes can cause, researchers have
proposed deepfake detection methods. However, they only focus on detecting a
single modality, i.e., either video or audio. On the other hand, to develop a
good deepfake detector that can cope with the recent advancements in deepfake
generation, we need to have a detector that can detect deepfakes of multiple
modalities, i.e., videos and audios. To build such a detector, we need a
dataset that contains video and respective audio deepfakes. We were able to
find a most recent deepfake dataset, Audio-Video Multimodal Deepfake Detection
Dataset (FakeAVCeleb), that contains not only deepfake videos but synthesized
fake audios as well. We used this multimodal deepfake dataset and performed
detailed baseline experiments using state-of-the-art unimodal, ensemble-based,
and multimodal detection methods to evaluate it. We conclude through detailed
experimentation that unimodals, addressing only a single modality, video or
audio, do not perform well compared to ensemble-based methods. Whereas purely
multimodal-based baselines provide the worst performance.]]></summary>

weights and activations, has emerged as one of the key ingredients to reduce
the size of neural networks for their deployments to resource-limited devices.
In order to overcome the nature of transforming continuous activations and
weights to discrete ones, recent study called Relaxed Quantization (RQ)
[Louizos et al. 2019] successfully employ the popular Gumbel-Softmax that
allows this transformation with efficient gradient-based optimization. However,
RQ with this Gumbel-Softmax relaxation still suffers from bias-variance
trade-off depending on the temperature parameter of Gumbel-Softmax. To resolve
the issue, we propose a novel method, Semi-Relaxed Quantization (SRQ) that uses
multi-class straight-through estimator to effectively reduce the bias and
variance, along with a new regularization technique, DropBits that replaces
dropout regularization to randomly drop the bits instead of neurons to further
reduce the bias of the multi-class straight-through estimator in SRQ. As a
natural extension of DropBits, we further introduce the way of learning
heterogeneous quantization levels to find proper bit-length for each layer
using DropBits. We experimentally validate our method on various benchmark
datasets and network architectures, and also support the quantized lottery
ticket hypothesis: learning heterogeneous quantization levels outperforms the
case using the same but fixed quantization levels from scratch.]]></summary>

the aforementioned issues, the MFH dataset is proposed to contain a total of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective framework that aims to transfer
meaningful information from a large teacher to a smaller student. Generally, KD
often involves how to define and transfer knowledge. Previous KD methods often
focus on mining various forms of knowledge, for example, feature maps and
refined information. However, the knowledge is derived from the primary
supervised task and thus is highly task-specific. Motivated by the recent
success of self-supervised representation learning, we propose an auxiliary
self-supervision augmented task to guide networks to learn more meaningful
features. Therefore, we can derive soft self-supervision augmented
distributions as richer dark knowledge from this task for KD. Unlike previous
knowledge, this distribution encodes joint knowledge from supervised and
self-supervised feature learning. Beyond knowledge exploration, another crucial
aspect is how to learn and distill our proposed knowledge effectively. To fully
take advantage of hierarchical feature maps, we propose to append several
auxiliary branches at various hidden layers. Each auxiliary branch is guided to
learn self-supervision augmented task and distill this distribution from
teacher to student. Thus we call our KD method as Hierarchical Self-Supervision
Augmented Knowledge Distillation (HSSAKD). Experiments on standard image
classification show that both offline and online HSSAKD achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the field of KD. Further transfer experiments
on object detection further verify that HSSAKD can guide the network to learn
better features, which can be attributed to learn and distill an auxiliary
self-supervision augmented task effectively.]]></summary>

step-wisely guide the training process. We demonstrate that this new loss
function can guide the SOD model to highlight more complete salient objects
step-by-step and meanwhile help to uncover the spatial dependencies of the
salient object pixels in a region growing manner. Moreover, a new feature
aggregation module is proposed to capture multi-scale features and aggregate
them adaptively by a branch-wise attention mechanism. Benefiting from this
module, our SOD framework takes advantage of adaptively aggregated multi-scale
features to locate and detect salient objects effectively. Experimental results
on several benchmark datasets show that our loss function not only advances the

convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to reconstruct HSIs have been developed.
However, most deep learning methods fit a brute-force mapping relationship

distribution is critical for real-world applications. To this end, there has
been a growing surge of interest to learn simultaneously from multiple training
domains - while enforcing different types of invariance across those domains.
Yet, all existing approaches fail to show systematic benefits under fair
evaluation protocols. In this paper, we propose a new learning scheme to

specifically, we introduce a regularization term that matches the domain-level
variances of gradients across training domains. Critically, our strategy, named
Fishr, exhibits close relations with the Fisher Information and the Hessian of
the loss. We show that forcing domain-level gradient covariances to be similar
during the learning procedure eventually aligns the domain-level loss
landscapes locally around the final weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of Fishr for out-of-distribution generalization. In
particular, Fishr improves the state of the art on the DomainBed benchmark and
performs significantly better than Empirical Risk Minimization. The code is

that the eigen-basis (a $p \times k$ matrix) is approximately sparse. We
propose a method that presumes the $p \times k$ matrix becomes approximately
sparse after a $k \times k$ rotation. The simplest version of the algorithm
initializes with the leading $k$ principal components. Then, the principal
components are rotated with an $k \times k$ orthogonal rotation to make them
approximately sparse. Finally, soft-thresholding is applied to the rotated
principal components. This approach differs from prior approaches because it
uses an orthogonal rotation to approximate a sparse basis. One consequence is
that a sparse component need not to be a leading eigenvector, but rather a
mixture of them. In this way, we propose a new (rotated) basis for sparse PCA.
In addition, our approach avoids "deflation" and multiple tuning parameters
required for that. Our sparse PCA framework is versatile; for example, it
extends naturally to a two-way analysis of a data matrix for simultaneous
dimensionality reduction of rows and columns. We provide evidence showing that
for the same level of sparsity, the proposed sparse PCA method is more stable
and can explain more variance compared to alternative methods. Through three
applications -- sparse coding of images, analysis of transcriptome sequencing
data, and large-scale clustering of social networks, we demonstrate the modern
usefulness of sparse PCA in exploring multivariate data.]]></summary>

the performance of our re-ID system. To handle this limitation, an intuitive
solution is to utilize collaborative training to purify the pseudo label
quality. However, there exists a challenge that the complementarity of two
networks, which inevitably share a high similarity, becomes weakened gradually
as training process goes on; worse still, these approaches typically ignore to
consider the self-discrepancy of intra-class relations. To address this issue,
in this paper, we propose a multiple co-teaching framework for domain adaptive
person re-ID, opening up a promising direction about self-discrepancy problem
under unsupervised condition. On top of that, a mean-teaching mechanism is
leveraged to enlarge the difference and discover more complementary features.
Comprehensive experiments conducted on several large-scale datasets show that
our method achieves competitive performance compared with the
state-of-the-arts.]]></summary>

of immense importance, as relying on paired synthetic data often limits their
generality and scalability in real-world applications. However, we noticed that
direct employ of unpaired adversarial learning and cycle-consistency
constraints in the SID task is insufficient to learn the underlying
relationship from rainy input to clean outputs, since the domain knowledge
between rainy and rain-free images is asymmetrical. To address such limitation,
we develop an effective unpaired SID method which explores mutual properties of
the unpaired exemplars by a contrastive learning manner in a GAN framework,
named as CDR-GAN. The proposed method mainly consists of two cooperative
branches: Bidirectional Translation Branch (BTB) and Contrastive Guidance
Branch (CGB). Specifically, BTB takes full advantage of the circulatory
architecture of adversarial consistency to exploit latent feature distributions
and guide transfer ability between two domains by equipping it with
bidirectional mapping. Simultaneously, CGB implicitly constrains the embeddings
of different exemplars in rain space by encouraging the similar feature
distributions closer while pushing the dissimilar further away, in order to
better help rain removal and image restoration. During training, we explore
several loss functions to further constrain the proposed CDR-GAN. Extensive
experiments show that our method performs favorably against existing unpaired
deraining approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets, even
outperforms several fully-supervised or semi-supervised models.]]></summary>

have drawn scant attention from the medical imaging community. Given the
ability to exploit long-term dependencies, transformers are promising to help
atypical convolutional neural networks (convnets) to overcome its inherent
shortcomings of spatial inductive bias. However, most of recently proposed
transformer-based segmentation approaches simply treated transformers as
assisted modules to help encode global context into convolutional
representations without investigating how to optimally combine self-attention
(i.e., the core of transformers) with convolution. To address this issue, in
this paper, we introduce nnFormer (i.e., Not-aNother transFormer), a powerful
segmentation model with an interleaved architecture based on empirical
combination of self-attention and convolution. In practice, nnFormer learns
volumetric representations from 3D local volumes. Compared to the naive
voxel-level self-attention implementation, such volume-based operations help to
reduce the computational complexity by approximate 98% and 99.5% on Synapse and
ACDC datasets, respectively. In comparison to prior-art network configurations,
nnFormer achieves tremendous improvements over previous transformer-based
methods on two commonly used datasets Synapse and ACDC. For instance, nnFormer
outperforms Swin-UNet by over 7 percents on Synapse. Even when compared to
nnUNet, currently the best performing fully-convolutional medical segmentation
network, nnFormer still provides slightly better performance on Synapse and
ACDC.]]></summary>

that our PLVC approach outperforms the previous traditional and learned

it can simply hardly contribute to accurate optical flow. To circumvent the

several ways to augment the optical flow variations. Extensive experimental

this paper, we propose a novel cross-generation feature interaction learning
(CFIL) framework for robust kinship verification. Particularly, an effective
collaborative weighting strategy is constructed to explore the characteristics
of cross-generation relations by corporately extracting features of both
parents and children image pairs. Specifically, we take parents and children as
a whole to extract the expressive local and non-local features. Different from
the traditional works measuring similarity by distance, we interpolate the
similarity calculations as the interior auxiliary weights into the deep CNN
architecture to learn the whole and natural features. These similarity weights
not only involve corresponding single points but also excavate the multiple
relationships cross points, where local and non-local features are calculated
by using these two kinds of distance measurements. Importantly, instead of
separately conducting similarity computation and feature extraction, we
integrate similarity learning and feature extraction into one unified learning
process. The integrated representations deduced from local and non-local
features can comprehensively express the informative semantics embedded in
images and preserve abundant correlation knowledge from image pairs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of the proposed model

videos, action triplet recognition stands out as the only one aiming to provide
truly fine-grained and comprehensive information on surgical activities. This
information, presented as <instrument, verb, target> combinations, is highly
challenging to be accurately identified. Triplet components can be difficult to
recognize individually; in this task, it requires not only performing
recognition simultaneously for all three triplet components, but also correctly
establishing the data association between them. To achieve this task, we
introduce our new model, the Rendezvous (RDV), which recognizes triplets
directly from surgical videos by leveraging attention at two different levels.
We first introduce a new form of spatial attention to capture individual action
triplet components in a scene; called the Class Activation Guided Attention
Mechanism (CAGAM). This technique focuses on the recognition of verbs and
targets using activations resulting from instruments. To solve the association
problem, our RDV model adds a new form of semantic attention inspired by
Transformer networks. Using multiple heads of cross and self attentions, RDV is
able to effectively capture relationships between instruments, verbs, and
targets. We also introduce CholecT50 - a dataset of 50 endoscopic videos in
which every frame has been annotated with labels from 100 triplet classes. Our
proposed RDV model significantly improves the triplet prediction mAP by over 9%

Most of previous FSL approaches resort to the meta-learning paradigm, where the
model accumulates inductive bias through learning many training tasks so as to
solve a new unseen few-shot task. In contrast, we propose a simple approach to
exploit unlabeled data accompanying the few-shot task for improving few-shot
performance. Firstly, we propose a Dependency Maximization method based on the
Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the cross-covariance operator, which maximizes the
statistical dependency between the embedded feature of those unlabeled data and
their label predictions, together with the supervised loss over the support
set. We then use the obtained model to infer the pseudo-labels for those
unlabeled data. Furthermore, we propose anInstance Discriminant Analysis to
evaluate the credibility of each pseudo-labeled example and select the most
faithful ones into an augmented support set to retrain the model as in the
first step. We iterate the above process until the pseudo-labels for the
unlabeled data becomes stable. Following the standard transductive and
semi-supervised FSL setting, our experiments show that the proposed method

informative captions for news article images. Unlike conventional image
captions that simply describe the content of the image in general terms, news
image captions follow journalistic guidelines and rely heavily on named
entities to describe the image content, often drawing context from the whole
article they are associated with. In this work, we propose a new approach to
this task, motivated by caption guidelines that journalists follow. Our
approach, Journalistic Guidelines Aware News Image Captioning (JoGANIC),
leverages the structure of captions to improve the generation quality and guide
our representation design. Experimental results, including detailed ablation
studies, on two large-scale publicly available datasets show that JoGANIC
substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods both on caption generation

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Transformer, as a strong and flexible architecture for modelling long-range
relations, has been widely explored in vision tasks. However, when used in
video inpainting that requires fine-grained representation, existed method
still suffers from yielding blurry edges in detail due to the hard patch
splitting. Here we aim to tackle this problem by proposing FuseFormer, a
Transformer model designed for video inpainting via fine-grained feature fusion
based on novel Soft Split and Soft Composition operations. The soft split
divides feature map into many patches with given overlapping interval. On the
contrary, the soft composition operates by stitching different patches into a
whole feature map where pixels in overlapping regions are summed up. These two
modules are first used in tokenization before Transformer layers and
de-tokenization after Transformer layers, for effective mapping between tokens
and features. Therefore, sub-patch level information interaction is enabled for
more effective feature propagation between neighboring patches, resulting in
synthesizing vivid content for hole regions in videos. Moreover, in FuseFormer,
we elaborately insert the soft composition and soft split into the feed-forward
network, enabling the 1D linear layers to have the capability of modelling 2D
structure. And, the sub-patch level feature fusion ability is further enhanced.
In both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our proposed FuseFormer
surpasses state-of-the-art methods. We also conduct detailed analysis to
examine its superiority.]]></summary>

someone eats and how much energy and nutrients are consumed from visual data.
Food classification is the first and most crucial step. Existing methods focus
on improving accuracy measured by the rate of correct classification based on
visual information alone, which is very challenging due to the high complexity
and inter-class similarity of foods. Further, accuracy in food classification
is conceptual as description of a food can always be improved. In this work, we
introduce a new food classification framework to improve the quality of
predictions by integrating the information from multiple domains while
maintaining the classification accuracy. We apply a multi-task network based on
a hierarchical structure that uses both visual and nutrition domain specific
information to cluster similar foods. Our method is validated on the modified
VIPER-FoodNet (VFN) food image dataset by including associated energy and
nutrient information. We achieve comparable classification accuracy with
existing methods that use visual information only, but with less error in terms
of energy and nutrient values for the wrong predictions.]]></summary>

increasingly polarized political ideologies. Most existing works focus on
identifying perspectives in news articles or social media posts, while social
entities, such as individuals and organizations, produce these texts and

stance prediction, which aims to predict entities' stances given their social
and political context. Specifically, we retrieve facts from Wikipedia about
social entities regarding contemporary U.S. politics. We then annotate social
entities' stances towards political ideologies with the help of domain experts.
After defining the task of entity stance prediction, we propose a graph-based
solution, which constructs a heterogeneous information network from collected
facts and adopts gated relational graph convolutional networks for
representation learning. Our model is then trained with a combination of
supervised, self-supervised and unsupervised loss functions, which are
motivated by multiple social and political phenomenons. We conduct extensive
experiments to compare our method with existing text and graph analysis
baselines. Our model achieves highest stance detection accuracy and yields
inspiring insights regarding social entity stances. We further conduct ablation

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The study of functional brain connectivity (FC) is important for
understanding the underlying mechanisms of many psychiatric disorders. Many
recent analyses adopt graph convolutional networks, to study non-linear
interactions between functionally-correlated states. However, although patterns
of brain activation are known to be hierarchically organised in both space and
time, many methods have failed to extract powerful spatio-temporal features. To
overcome those challenges, and improve understanding of long-range functional
dynamics, we translate an approach, from the domain of skeleton-based action
recognition, designed to model interactions across space and time. We evaluate
this approach using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset on sex
classification and fluid intelligence prediction. To account for subject
topographic variability of functional organisation, we modelled functional
connectomes using multi-resolution dual-regressed (subject-specific) ICA nodes.
Results show a prediction accuracy of 94.4% for sex classification (an increase
of 6.2% compared to other methods), and an improvement of correlation with
fluid intelligence of 0.325 vs 0.144, relative to a baseline model that encodes
space and time separately. Results suggest that explicit encoding of
spatio-temporal dynamics of brain functional activity may improve the precision
with which behavioural and cognitive phenotypes may be predicted in the future.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image classification is a major application domain for conventional deep
learning (DL). Quantum machine learning (QML) has the potential to
revolutionize image classification. In any typical DL-based image
classification, we use convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features
from the image and multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) to create the actual
decision boundaries. On one hand, QML models can be useful in both of these
tasks. Convolution with parameterized quantum circuits (Quanvolution) can
extract rich features from the images. On the other hand, quantum neural
network (QNN) models can create complex decision boundaries. Therefore,
Quanvolution and QNN can be used to create an end-to-end QML model for image
classification. Alternatively, we can extract image features separately using
classical dimension reduction techniques such as, Principal Components Analysis
(PCA) or Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) and use the extracted features to
train a QNN. We review two proposals on quantum-classical hybrid ML models for
image classification namely, Quanvolutional Neural Network and dimension
reduction using a classical algorithm followed by QNN. Particularly, we make a
case for trainable filters in Quanvolution and CAE-based feature extraction for
image datasets (instead of dimension reduction using linear transformations
such as, PCA). We discuss various design choices, potential opportunities, and
drawbacks of these models. We also release a Python-based framework to create
and explore these hybrid models with a variety of design choices.]]></summary>

highly-compressive domain-invariant approach for performing visual place
recognition (VPR) across domains (e.g., time of day, weather, and season).
However, landmark-based self-localization can be an ill-posed problem for a
passive observer (e.g., manual robot control), as many viewpoints may not
provide an effective landmark view. In this study, we consider an active
self-localization task by an active observer and present a novel reinforcement
learning (RL)-based next-best-view (NBV) planner. Our contributions are as
follows. (1) SIMBAD-based VPR: We formulate the problem of landmark-based
compact scene description as SIMBAD (similarity-based pattern recognition) and
further present its deep learning extension. (2) VPR-to-NBV knowledge transfer:
We address the challenge of RL under uncertainty (i.e., active
self-localization) by transferring the state recognition ability of VPR to the
NBV. (3) NNQL-based NBV: We regard the available VPR as the experience database
by adapting nearest-neighbor approximation of Q-learning (NNQL). The result
shows an extremely compact data structure that compresses both the VPR and NBV
into a single incremental inverted index. Experiments using the public NCLT
dataset validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.]]></summary>

the classifier can (1) classify the test samples of known classes to their

paper studies the problem of zero-shot open-set detection, which still performs

to solve the problem. ZO-CLIP builds on top of the recent advances in zero-shot
classification through multi-modal representation learning. It first extends
the pre-trained multi-modal model CLIP by training a text-based image
description generator on top of CLIP. In testing, it uses the extended model to
generate some candidate unknown class names for each test sample and computes a
confidence score based on both the known class names and candidate unknown

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reducing traffic fatalities and serious injuries is a top priority of the US
Department of Transportation. The computer vision (CV)-based crash anticipation
in the near-crash phase is receiving growing attention. The ability to perceive
fatal crash risks earlier is also critical because it will improve the
reliability of crash anticipation. Yet, annotated image data for training a
reliable AI model for the early visual perception of crash risks are not
abundant. The Fatality Analysis Reporting System contains big data of fatal
crashes. It is a reliable data source for learning the relationship between
driving scene characteristics and fatal crashes to compensate for the
limitation of CV. Therefore, this paper develops a data analytics model, named
scenario-wise, Spatio-temporal attention guidance, from fatal crash report
data, which can estimate the relevance of detected objects to fatal crashes
from their environment and context information. First, the paper identifies
five sparse variables that allow for decomposing the 5-year fatal crash dataset
to develop scenario-wise attention guidance. Then, exploratory analysis of
location- and time-related variables of the crash report data suggests reducing
fatal crashes to spatially defined groups. The group's temporal pattern is an
indicator of the similarity of fatal crashes in the group. Hierarchical
clustering and K-means clustering merge the spatially defined groups into six
clusters according to the similarity of their temporal patterns. After that,
association rule mining discovers the statistical relationship between the
temporal information of driving scenes with crash features, for each cluster.
The paper shows how the developed attention guidance supports the design and
implementation of a preliminary CV model that can identify objects of a
possibility to involve in fatal crashes from their environment and context
information.]]></summary>

vision-based or machine learning-based. The former approaches typically employ
2-D image analysis/understanding or 3-D point cloud modeling and segmentation
algorithms to detect road potholes from vision sensor data. The latter
approaches generally address road pothole detection using convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) in an end-to-end manner. However, road potholes are not
necessarily ubiquitous and it is challenging to prepare a large well-annotated
dataset for CNN training. In this regard, while computer vision-based methods
were the mainstream research trend in the past decade, machine learning-based
methods were merely discussed. Recently, we published the first stereo
vision-based road pothole detection dataset and a novel disparity
transformation algorithm, whereby the damaged and undamaged road areas can be
highly distinguished. However, there are no benchmarks currently available for
state-of-the-art (SoTA) CNNs trained using either disparity images or
transformed disparity images. Therefore, in this paper, we first discuss the
SoTA CNNs designed for semantic segmentation and evaluate their performance for
road pothole detection with extensive experiments. Additionally, inspired by
graph neural network (GNN), we propose a novel CNN layer, referred to as graph
attention layer (GAL), which can be easily deployed in any existing CNN to
optimize image feature representations for semantic segmentation. Our
experiments compare GAL-DeepLabv3+, our best-performing implementation, with
nine SoTA CNNs on three modalities of training data: RGB images, disparity
images, and transformed disparity images. The experimental results suggest that
our proposed GAL-DeepLabv3+ achieves the best overall pothole detection
accuracy on all training data modalities.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While deep learning models have greatly improved the performance of most
artificial intelligence tasks, they are often criticized to be untrustworthy
due to the black-box problem. Consequently, many works have been proposed to
study the trustworthiness of deep learning. However, as most open datasets are
designed for evaluating the accuracy of model outputs, there is still a lack of
appropriate datasets for evaluating the inner workings of neural networks. The
lack of datasets obviously hinders the development of trustworthiness research.
Therefore, in order to systematically evaluate the factors for building
trustworthy systems, we propose a novel and well-annotated sentiment analysis
dataset to evaluate robustness and interpretability. To evaluate these factors,
our dataset contains diverse annotations about the challenging distribution of
instances, manual adversarial instances and sentiment explanations. Several
evaluation metrics are further proposed for interpretability and robustness.
Based on the dataset and metrics, we conduct comprehensive comparisons for the
trustworthiness of three typical models, and also study the relations between
accuracy, robustness and interpretability. We release this trustworthiness
evaluation dataset at \url{https://github/xyz} and hope our work can facilitate
the progress on building more trustworthy systems for real-world applications.]]></summary>

using corresponding landmarks in the images. However, the benefits thereof are
largely understudied, especially due to the lack of automatic detection methods

work, we present a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), called DCNN-Match,
that learns to predict landmark correspondences in 3D images in a
self-supervised manner. We explored five variants of DCNN-Match that use
different loss functions and tested DCNN-Match separately as well as in
combination with the open-source registration software Elastix to assess its
impact on a common DIR approach. We employed lower-abdominal Computed
Tomography (CT) scans from cervical cancer patients: 121 pelvic CT scan pairs
containing simulated elastic transformations and 11 pairs demonstrating
clinical deformations. Our results show significant improvement in DIR
performance when landmark correspondences predicted by DCNN-Match were used in
case of simulated as well as clinical deformations. We also observed that the
spatial distribution of the automatically identified landmarks and the
associated matching errors affect the extent of improvement in DIR. Finally,
DCNN-Match was found to generalize well to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

computer vision tasks, they often fail to generalize to new domains and subtle
variations of input images. Several defenses have been proposed to improve the
robustness against these variations. However, current defenses can only
withstand the specific attack used in training, and the models often remain
vulnerable to other input variations. Moreover, these methods often degrade
performance of the model on clean images and do not generalize to out-of-domain
samples. In this paper we present Generative Adversarial Training, an approach
to simultaneously improve the model's generalization to the test set and
out-of-domain samples as well as its robustness to unseen adversarial attacks.
Instead of altering a low-level pre-defined aspect of images, we generate a
spectrum of low-level, mid-level and high-level changes using generative models
with a disentangled latent space. Adversarial training with these examples
enable the model to withstand a wide range of attacks by observing a variety of
input alterations during training. We show that our approach not only improves
performance of the model on clean images and out-of-domain samples but also
makes it robust against unforeseen attacks and outperforms prior work. We
validate effectiveness of our method by demonstrating results on various tasks
such as classification, segmentation and object detection.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few-shot classification (FSC) is one of the most concerned hot issues in
recent years. The general setting consists of two phases: (1) Pre-train a
feature extraction model (FEM) with base data (has large amounts of labeled
samples). (2) Use the FEM to extract the features of novel data (with few
labeled samples and totally different categories from base data), then classify
them with the to-be-designed classifier. The adaptability of pre-trained FEM to
novel data determines the accuracy of novel features, thereby affecting the
final classification performances. To this end, how to appraise the pre-trained
FEM is the most crucial focus in the FSC community. It sounds like traditional
Class Activate Mapping (CAM) based methods can achieve this by overlaying
weighted feature maps. However, due to the particularity of FSC (e.g., there is
no backpropagation when using the pre-trained FEM to extract novel features),
we cannot activate the feature map with the novel classes. To address this
challenge, we propose a simple, flexible method, dubbed as Class-Irrelevant
Mapping (CIM). Specifically, first, we introduce dictionary learning theory and
view the channels of the feature map as the bases in a dictionary. Then we
utilize the feature map to fit the feature vector of an image to achieve the
corresponding channel weights. Finally, we overlap the weighted feature map for
visualization to appraise the ability of pre-trained FEM on novel data. For
fair use of CIM in evaluating different models, we propose a new measurement
index, called Feature Localization Accuracy (FLA). In experiments, we first
compare our CIM with CAM in regular tasks and achieve outstanding performances.
Next, we use our CIM to appraise several classical FSC frameworks without
considering the classification results and discuss them.]]></summary>

challenges introduced by video, namely effects induced by changing lighting,
motion blur, diverse variations in camera-object pose over time,and
preservation of temporal consistency. We parse the problem into three steps.
First, the text in all frames is normalized to a frontal pose using a
spatio-temporal trans-former network. Second, the text is replaced in a single
reference frame using a state-of-art still-image text replacement method.
Finally, the new text is transferred from the reference to remaining frames
using a novel learned image transformation network that captures lighting and
blur effects in a temporally consistent manner. Results on synthetic and
challenging real videos show realistic text trans-fer, competitive quantitative
and qualitative performance,and superior inference speed relative to

recover the 3D head shape by iteratively fitting a 3D morphable model of the

forgetting of multilingual knowledge and, consequently, poor zero-shot transfer
to other languages. Adaptation strategies, namely partial fine-tuning,
adapters, BITFIT, LNFIT, originally proposed to accelerate fine-tuning for new

improving zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, but their impact also depends on

the language structure and semantics of general texts. However, those models do
not consider the numerical properties of numbers and cannot perform robustly on
numerical reasoning tasks (e.g., math word problems and measurement
estimation). In this paper, we propose NumGPT, a generative pre-trained model
that explicitly models the numerical properties of numbers in texts.
Specifically, it leverages a prototype-based numeral embedding to encode the
mantissa of the number and an individual embedding to encode the exponent of
the number. A numeral-aware loss function is designed to integrate numerals
into the pre-training objective of NumGPT. We conduct extensive experiments on
four different datasets to evaluate the numeracy ability of NumGPT. The
experiment results show that NumGPT outperforms baseline models (e.g., GPT and
GPT with DICE) on a range of numerical reasoning tasks such as measurement
estimation, number comparison, math word problems, and magnitude
classification. Ablation studies are also conducted to evaluate the impact of
pre-training and model hyperparameters on the performance.]]></summary>

target sequence before they have processed the source sequence. The recent
adaptive policies for SNMT use monotonic attention to perform read/write

sufficient information might cause the monotonic attention to take poor
read/write decisions, which in turn negatively affects the performance of the
SNMT model. On the other hand, human translators make better read/write
decisions since they can anticipate the immediate future words using linguistic
information and domain knowledge.Motivated by human translators, in this work,
we propose a framework to aid monotonic attention with an external language

sentiment polarity of a specified aspect in a sentence. ALSC is a practical
setting in aspect-based sentiment analysis due to no opinion term labeling
needed, but it fails to interpret why a sentiment polarity is derived for the
aspect. To address this problem, recent works fine-tune pre-trained Transformer
encoders for ALSC to extract an aspect-centric dependency tree that can locate
the opinion words. However, the induced opinion words only provide an intuitive
cue far below human-level interpretability. Besides, the pre-trained encoder
tends to internalize an aspect's intrinsic sentiment, causing sentiment bias
and thus affecting model performance. In this paper, we propose a span-based
anti-bias aspect representation learning framework. It first eliminates the
sentiment bias in the aspect embedding by adversarial learning against aspects'
prior sentiment. Then, it aligns the distilled opinion candidates with the
aspect by span-based dependency modeling to highlight the interpretable opinion
terms. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks,
with the capability of unsupervised opinion extraction.]]></summary>

off-type beet (green leaves), parsley and spinach. Our experiments show that
with small set of labelled training data, ViT models perform better compared to

skeleton-based action recognition. However, in most GCN-based methods, the
spatial-temporal graph convolution is strictly restricted by the graph topology
while only captures the short-term temporal context, thus lacking the
flexibility of feature extraction. In this work, we present a novel
architecture, named Graph Convolutional skeleton Transformer (GCsT), which
addresses limitations in GCNs by introducing Transformer. Our GCsT employs all
the benefits of Transformer (i.e. dynamical attention and global context) while
keeps the advantages of GCNs (i.e. hierarchy and local topology structure). In
GCsT, the spatial-temporal GCN forces the capture of local dependencies while
Transformer dynamically extracts global spatial-temporal relationships.
Furthermore, the proposed GCsT shows stronger expressive capability by adding
additional information present in skeleton sequences. Incorporating the
Transformer allows that information to be introduced into the model almost
effortlessly. We validate the proposed GCsT by conducting extensive
experiments, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance on NTU RGB+D, NTU
RGB+D 120 and Northwestern-UCLA datasets.]]></summary>

an analysis of the cost-benefit trade-off of training such models. Our

auditory cues. While machines are able to do the same with visual data already,
less work has been done with sounds. This work develops an approach for scene
understanding purely based on binaural sounds. The considered tasks include
predicting the semantic masks of sound-making objects, the motion of
sound-making objects, and the depth map of the scene. To this aim, we propose a
novel sensor setup and record a new audio-visual dataset of street scenes with
eight professional binaural microphones and a 360-degree camera. The
co-existence of visual and audio cues is leveraged for supervision transfer. In
particular, we employ a cross-modal distillation framework that consists of
multiple vision teacher methods and a sound student method -- the student
method is trained to generate the same results as the teacher methods do. This
way, the auditory system can be trained without using human annotations. To
further boost the performance, we propose another novel auxiliary task, coined
Spatial Sound Super-Resolution, to increase the directional resolution of
sounds. We then formulate the four tasks into one end-to-end trainable
multi-tasking network aiming to boost the overall performance. Experimental
results show that 1) our method achieves good results for all four tasks, 2)
the four tasks are mutually beneficial -- training them together achieves the
best performance, 3) the number and orientation of microphones are both
important, and 4) features learned from the standard spectrogram and features
obtained by the classic signal processing pipeline are complementary for
auditory perception tasks. The data and code are released.]]></summary>

detached sessions, which is a fundamental task in understanding multi-party
conversations. Existing work on conversation disentanglement relies heavily
upon human-annotated datasets, which are expensive to obtain in practice. In
this work, we explore to train a conversation disentanglement model without
referencing any human annotations. Our method is built upon a deep co-training
algorithm, which consists of two neural networks: a message-pair classifier and
a session classifier. The former is responsible for retrieving local relations
between two messages while the latter categorizes a message to a session by
capturing context-aware information. Both networks are initialized respectively
with pseudo data built from an unannotated corpus. During the deep co-training
process, we use the session classifier as a reinforcement learning component to
learn a session assigning policy by maximizing the local rewards given by the
message-pair classifier. For the message-pair classifier, we enrich its
training data by retrieving message pairs with high confidence from the
disentangled sessions predicted by the session classifier. Experimental results
on the large Movie Dialogue Dataset demonstrate that our proposed approach
achieves competitive performance compared to the previous supervised methods.
Further experiments show that the predicted disentangled conversations can
promote the performance on the downstream task of multi-party response
selection.]]></summary>

Directly training a model with labeled OOS examples yields reasonable

this limited-data problem, previous methods focus on better modeling the
distribution of in-scope (INS) examples. We introduce GOLD as an orthogonal
technique that augments existing data to train better OOS detectors operating
in low-data regimes. GOLD generates pseudo-labeled candidates using samples
from an auxiliary dataset and keeps only the most beneficial candidates for
training through a novel filtering mechanism. In experiments across three
target benchmarks, the top GOLD model outperforms all existing methods on all

performance on many downstream natural language processing (NLP) applications
via fine-tuning. In this paper, we target at how to further improve the token
representations on the language models. We, therefore, propose a simple yet
effective plug-and-play module, Sequential Attention Module (SAM), on the token
embeddings learned from a pre-trained language model. Our proposed SAM consists
of two main attention modules deployed sequentially: Feature-wise Attention
Module (FAM) and Token-wise Attention Module (TAM). More specifically, FAM can
effectively identify the importance of features at each dimension and promote
the effect via dot-product on the original token embeddings for downstream NLP
applications. Meanwhile, TAM can further re-weight the features at the
token-wise level. Moreover, we propose an adaptive filter on FAM to prevent
noise impact and increase information absorption. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments to demonstrate the advantages and properties of our proposed SAM.
We first show how SAM plays a primary role in the champion solution of two
subtasks of SemEval'21 Task 7. After that, we apply SAM on sentiment analysis
and three popular NLP tasks and demonstrate that SAM consistently outperforms

Applications of differential privacy in various scenarios, such as protecting

results on downstream tasks while providing tight privacy guarantees. Our proof
reveals that ADePT is not differentially private, thus rendering the
experimental results unsubstantiated. We also quantify the impact of the error
in its private mechanism, showing that the true sensitivity is higher by at
least factor 6 in an optimistic case of a very small encoder's dimension and
that the amount of utterances that are not privatized could easily reach 100%

applications in NLP rely on formal guarantees, these should be outlined in full

Cortana, provide a new search paradigm where users are allowed, via natural
language dialogues, to communicate with search systems. Evaluating such systems
is very challenging since search results are presented in the format of natural
language sentences. Given the unlimited number of possible responses,
collecting relevance assessments for all the possible responses is infeasible.
In this paper, we propose POSSCORE, a simple yet effective automatic evaluation
method for conversational search. The proposed embedding-based metric takes the
influence of part of speech (POS) of the terms in the response into account. To
the best knowledge, our work is the first to systematically demonstrate the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Math word problem (MWP) is a challenging and critical task in natural
language processing. Many recent studies formalize MWP as a generation task and
have adopted sequence-to-sequence models to transform problem descriptions to
mathematical expressions. However, mathematical expressions are prone to minor
mistakes while the generation objective does not explicitly handle such
mistakes. To address this limitation, we devise a new ranking task for MWP and
propose Generate & Rank, a multi-task framework based on a generative
pre-trained language model. By joint training with generation and ranking, the
model learns from its own mistakes and is able to distinguish between correct
and incorrect expressions. Meanwhile, we perform tree-based disturbance
specially designed for MWP and an online update to boost the ranker. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on the benchmark and the
results show that our method consistently outperforms baselines in all
datasets. Particularly, in the classical Math23k, our method is 7% (78.4%
$\rightarrow$ 85.4%) higher than the state-of-the-art.]]></summary>

expensive to manually create advertisements that meet the needs of various
queries for massive items. In this paper, we propose the query-variant
advertisement text generation task that aims to generate candidate
advertisements for different queries with various needs given the item
keywords. In this task, for many different queries there is only one general
purposed advertisement with no predefined query-advertisement pair, which would
discourage traditional End-to-End models from generating query-variant
advertisements for different queries with different needs. To deal with the
problem, we propose a query-variant advertisement text generation model that
takes keywords and associated external knowledge as input during training and
adds different queries during inference. Adding external knowledge helps the
model adapted to the information besides the item keywords during training,
which makes the transition between training and inference more smoothing when
the query is added during inference. Both automatic and human evaluation show
that our model can generate more attractive and query-focused advertisements
than the strong baselines.]]></summary>

depends upon the provenance of the test set. If the test set was originally in

individual or a group motivated by the targeted entity's identity or opinions.
The rising mass communication through social media further exacerbates the

research on hate-speech identification using Natural Language Processing (NLP),
the work on utilizing NLP for prevention and intervention of online hate speech
lacks relatively. This paper presents a holistic conceptual framework on

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for paraphrase generation by
treating the task as unsupervised machine translation (UMT) based on the
assumption that there must be pairs of sentences expressing the same meaning in
a large-scale unlabeled monolingual corpus. The proposed paradigm first splits
a large unlabeled corpus into multiple clusters, and trains multiple UMT models
using pairs of these clusters. Then based on the paraphrase pairs produced by
these UMT models, a unified surrogate model can be trained to serve as the
final Seq2Seq model to generate paraphrases, which can be directly used for
test in the unsupervised setup, or be finetuned on labeled datasets in the
supervised setup. The proposed method offers merits over
machine-translation-based paraphrase generation methods, as it avoids reliance
on bilingual sentence pairs. It also allows human intervene with the model so
that more diverse paraphrases can be generated using different filtering
criteria. Extensive experiments on existing paraphrase dataset for both the
supervised and unsupervised setups demonstrate the effectiveness the proposed
paradigm.]]></summary>

text that they write. In this study, we investigate lexicon usages across
styles throughout two lenses: human perception and machine word importance,
since words differ in the strength of the stylistic cues that they provide. To
collect labels of human perception, we curate a new dataset, Hummingbird, on
top of benchmarking style datasets. We have crowd workers highlight the
representative words in the text that makes them think the text has the
following styles: politeness, sentiment, offensiveness, and five emotion types.
We then compare these human word labels with word importance derived from a
popular fine-tuned style classifier like BERT. Our results show that the BERT
often finds content words not relevant to the target style as important words
used in style prediction, but humans do not perceive the same way even though
for some styles (e.g., positive sentiment and joy) human- and
machine-identified words share significant overlap for some styles.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pretrained contextualized representations offer great success for many
downstream tasks, including document ranking. The multilingual versions of such
pretrained representations provide a possibility of jointly learning many
languages with the same model. Although it is expected to gain big with such
joint training, in the case of cross lingual information retrieval (CLIR), the
models under a multilingual setting are not achieving the same level of
performance as those under a monolingual setting. We hypothesize that the
performance drop is due to the translation gap between query and documents. In
the monolingual retrieval task, because of the same lexical inputs, it is
easier for model to identify the query terms that occurred in documents.
However, in the multilingual pretrained models that the words in different
languages are projected into the same hyperspace, the model tends to translate
query terms into related terms, i.e., terms that appear in a similar context,
in addition to or sometimes rather than synonyms in the target language. This
property is creating difficulties for the model to connect terms that cooccur
in both query and document. To address this issue, we propose a novel Mixed
Attention Transformer (MAT) that incorporates external word level knowledge,
such as a dictionary or translation table. We design a sandwich like
architecture to embed MAT into the recent transformer based deep neural models.
By encoding the translation knowledge into an attention matrix, the model with
MAT is able to focus on the mutually translated words in the input sequence.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the external knowledge
and the significant improvement of MAT embedded neural reranking model on CLIR
task.]]></summary>

language models. The downside is that fine-tuning may cause models to overfit
to task-specific data and thereby forget their knowledge gained during
pre-training. Recent works only propose lightweight model updates as models may
already possess useful knowledge from past experience, but a challenge remains
in understanding what parts and to what extent models should be refined for a
given task. In this paper, we investigate what models learn from commonsense
reasoning datasets. We measure the impact of three different adaptation methods
on the generalization and accuracy of models. Our experiments with two models
show that fine-tuning performs best, by learning both the content and the
structure of the task, but suffers from overfitting and limited generalization
to novel answers. We observe that alternative adaptation methods like
prefix-tuning have comparable accuracy, but generalize better to unseen answers
and are more robust to adversarial splits.]]></summary>

Moreover, we argue that in order to make further progress in recommendation

anaphora recognition assume that the gold mention or syntactic tree information
is given (Hou et al., 2013; Roesiger et al., 2018; Hou, 2020; Yu and Poesio,
2020). In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural approach for information
status classification. Our approach consists of a mention extraction component
and an information status assignment component. During the inference time, our
system takes a raw text as the input and generates mentions together with their
information status. On the ISNotes corpus (Markert et al., 2012), we show that
our information status assignment component achieves new state-of-the-art
results on fine-grained IS classification based on gold mentions. Furthermore,
our system performs significantly better than other baselines for both mention
extraction and fine-grained IS classification in the end-to-end setting.
Finally, we apply our system on BASHI (Roesiger, 2018) and SciCorp (Roesiger,
2016) to recognize referential bridging anaphora. We find that our end-to-end
system trained on ISNotes achieves competitive results on bridging anaphora
recognition compared to the previous state-of-the-art system that relies on
syntactic information and is trained on the in-domain datasets (Yu and Poesio,
2020).]]></summary>

terms which are terms characterizing a specific group of people such as
"Muslim" and "black". Such bias is commonly reflected in false-positive
predictions, i.e. non-toxic comments with identity terms. In this work, we
propose a novel approach to tackle such bias in toxic comment classification,
leveraging the notion of subjectivity level of a comment and the presence of
identity terms. We hypothesize that when a comment is made about a group of
people that is characterized by an identity term, the likelihood of that
comment being toxic is associated with the subjectivity level of the comment,
i.e. the extent to which the comment conveys personal feelings and opinions.
Building upon the BERT model, we propose a new structure that is able to
leverage these features, and thoroughly evaluate our model on 4 datasets of
varying sizes and representing different social media platforms. The results
show that our model can consistently outperform BERT and a SOTA model devised
to address identity term bias in a different way, with a maximum improvement in
F1 of 2.43% and 1.91% respectively.]]></summary>

engagement signals in unison with rich content representations will pave the
way to building powerful personalization algorithms that will revolutionise

construct a novel dataset from a popular video lecture repository, 2) identify

text-to-table, which can be viewed as an inverse problem of the well-studied
table-to-text. In text-to-table, given a text, one creates a table or several
tables expressing the main content of the text, while the model is learned from
text-table pair data. The problem setting differs from those of the existing
methods for IE. First, the extraction can be carried out from long texts to
large tables with complex structures. Second, the extraction is entirely
data-driven, and there is no need to explicitly define the schemas. As far as
we know, there has been no previous work that studies the problem. In this
work, we formalize text-to-table as a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) problem.
We first employ a seq2seq model fine-tuned from a pre-trained language model to
perform the task. We also develop a new method within the seq2seq approach,
exploiting two additional techniques in table generation: table constraint and
table relation embeddings. We make use of four existing table-to-text datasets
in our experiments on text-to-table. Experimental results show that the vanilla
seq2seq model can outperform the baseline methods of using relation extraction
and named entity extraction. The results also show that our method can further
boost the performances of the vanilla seq2seq model. We further discuss the
main challenges of the proposed task. The code and data will be made publicly
available.]]></summary>

downstream tasks, including document ranking. The multilingual versions of such
pretrained representations provide a possibility of jointly learning many
languages with the same model. Although it is expected to gain big with such
joint training, in the case of cross lingual information retrieval (CLIR), the
models under a multilingual setting are not achieving the same level of
performance as those under a monolingual setting. We hypothesize that the
performance drop is due to the translation gap between query and documents. In
the monolingual retrieval task, because of the same lexical inputs, it is
easier for model to identify the query terms that occurred in documents.
However, in the multilingual pretrained models that the words in different
languages are projected into the same hyperspace, the model tends to translate
query terms into related terms, i.e., terms that appear in a similar context,
in addition to or sometimes rather than synonyms in the target language. This
property is creating difficulties for the model to connect terms that cooccur
in both query and document. To address this issue, we propose a novel Mixed
Attention Transformer (MAT) that incorporates external word level knowledge,
such as a dictionary or translation table. We design a sandwich like
architecture to embed MAT into the recent transformer based deep neural models.
By encoding the translation knowledge into an attention matrix, the model with
MAT is able to focus on the mutually translated words in the input sequence.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the external knowledge
and the significant improvement of MAT embedded neural reranking model on CLIR
task.]]></summary>

recommendations in domains with limited knowledge about user preferences. We
expand the variational autoencoder collaborative filtering from a single-domain
to a multi-domain setting. The intuition is that user-item interactions in a
source domain can augment the recommendation quality in a target domain. The
intuition can be taken to its extreme, where, in a cross-domain setup, the user
history in a source domain is enough to generate high-quality recommendations
in a target one. We thus create a Product-of-Experts (POE) architecture for
recommendations that jointly models user-item interactions across multiple
domains. The method is resilient to missing data for one or more of the
domains, which is a situation often found in real life. We present results on
two widely-used datasets - Amazon and Yelp, which support the claim that
holistic user preference knowledge leads to better recommendations.
Surprisingly, we find that in some cases, a POE recommender that does not
access the target domain user representation can surpass a strong VAE
recommender baseline trained on the target domain.]]></summary>

generative models. Due to the difficulties of capturing long dependency
structures, these methods rarely model the raw documents directly, but instead
to model the features extracted from them (e.g. bag-of-words (BOW), TFIDF). In
this paper, we propose to learn hash codes from BERT embeddings after observing
their tremendous successes on downstream tasks. As a first try, we modify
existing generative hashing models to accommodate the BERT embeddings. However,
little improvement is observed over the codes learned from the old BOW or TFIDF
features. We attribute this to the reconstruction requirement in the generative
hashing, which will enforce irrelevant information that is abundant in the BERT
embeddings also compressed into the codes. To remedy this issue, a new
unsupervised hashing paradigm is further proposed based on the mutual
information (MI) maximization principle. Specifically, the method first
constructs appropriate global and local codes from the documents and then seeks
to maximize their mutual information. Experimental results on three benchmark
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate hash codes
that outperform existing ones learned from BOW features by a substantial
margin.]]></summary>

SNN-based SDMs perform in comparison to conventional SDMs. Towards this, we
have simulated both conventional and SNN-based SDM and CMM on Nengo. We observe
that SNN-based models perform similarly as the conventional ones. In order to
evaluate the performance of different SNNs, we repeated the experiment using
Adaptive-LIF, Spiking Rectified Linear Unit, and Izhikevich models and obtained
similar results. We conclude that it is indeed feasible to develop some types
of associative memories using spiking neurons whose memory capacity and other
features are similar to the performance without SNNs. Finally we have
implemented an application where MNIST images, encoded with N-of-M codes, are

Cortana, provide a new search paradigm where users are allowed, via natural
language dialogues, to communicate with search systems. Evaluating such systems
is very challenging since search results are presented in the format of natural
language sentences. Given the unlimited number of possible responses,
collecting relevance assessments for all the possible responses is infeasible.
In this paper, we propose POSSCORE, a simple yet effective automatic evaluation
method for conversational search. The proposed embedding-based metric takes the
influence of part of speech (POS) of the terms in the response into account. To
the best knowledge, our work is the first to systematically demonstrate the
importance of incorporating syntactic information, such as POS labels, for
conversational search evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our
metrics can correlate with human preference, achieving significant improvements
over state-of-the-art baseline metrics.]]></summary>

challenging problem for current recommendation systems. Various methods have
been proposed to address it via leveraging the advantages of graph neural
networks (GNNs) or multi-task learning. However, most existing works do not
take the complex dependencies among different behaviors of users into
consideration. They utilize simple and fixed schemes, like neighborhood
information aggregation or mathematical calculation of vectors, to fuse the
embeddings of different user behaviors to obtain a unified embedding to
represent a user's behavioral patterns which will be used in downstream
recommendation tasks. To tackle the challenge, in this paper, we first propose
the concept of hyper meta-path to construct hyper meta-paths or hyper
meta-graphs to explicitly illustrate the dependencies among different behaviors
of a user. How to obtain a unified embedding for a user from hyper meta-paths
and avoid the previously mentioned limitations simultaneously is critical.
Thanks to the recent success of graph contrastive learning, we leverage it to
learn embeddings of user behavior patterns adaptively instead of assigning a
fixed scheme to understand the dependencies among different behaviors. A new
graph contrastive learning based framework is proposed by coupling with hyper
meta-paths, namely HMG-CR, which consistently and significantly outperforms all
baselines in extensive comparison experiments.]]></summary>

the critical challenges in deep reinforcement learning. A representative
solution is to leverage reward shaping to provide intrinsic rewards for the
agent to encourage exploration. However, most existing methods suffer from
vanishing intrinsic rewards, which cannot provide sustainable exploration
incentives. Moreover, they rely heavily on complex models and additional memory
to record learning procedures, resulting in high computational complexity and
low robustness. To tackle this problem, entropy-based methods are proposed to
evaluate the global exploration performance, encouraging the agent to visit the
state space more equitably. However, the sample complexity of estimating the
state visitation entropy is prohibitive when handling environments with
high-dimensional observations. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric
entitled Jain's fairness index (JFI) to replace the entropy regularizer, which
solves the exploration problem from a brand new perspective. In sharp contrast
to the entropy regularizer, JFI is more computable and robust and can be easily
applied generalized into arbitrary tasks. Furthermore, we leverage a
variational auto-encoder (VAE) model to capture the life-long novelty of
states, which is combined with the global JFI score to form multimodal
intrinsic rewards. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that our
multimodal reward shaping (MMRS) method can achieve higher performance than
other benchmark schemes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce Neural Marching Cubes (NMC), a data-driven approach for
extracting a triangle mesh from a discretized implicit field. Classical MC is
defined by coarse tessellation templates isolated to individual cubes. While
more refined tessellations have been proposed, they all make heuristic
assumptions, such as trilinearity, when determining the vertex positions and
local mesh topologies in each cube. In principle, none of these approaches can
reconstruct geometric features that reveal coherence or dependencies between
nearby cubes (e.g., a sharp edge), as such information is unaccounted for,
resulting in poor estimates of the true underlying implicit field. To tackle
these challenges, we re-cast MC from a deep learning perspective, by designing
tessellation templates more apt at preserving geometric features, and learning
the vertex positions and mesh topologies from training meshes, to account for
contextual information from nearby cubes. We develop a compact per-cube
parameterization to represent the output triangle mesh, while being compatible
with neural processing, so that a simple 3D convolutional network can be
employed for the training. We show that all topological cases in each cube that
are applicable to our design can be easily derived using our representation,
and the resulting tessellations can also be obtained naturally and efficiently
by following a few design guidelines. In addition, our network learns local
features with limited receptive fields, hence it generalizes well to new shapes
and new datasets. We evaluate our neural MC approach by quantitative and
qualitative comparisons to all well-known MC variants. In particular, we
demonstrate the ability of our network to recover sharp features such as edges
and corners, a long-standing issue of MC and its variants. Our network also
reconstructs local mesh topologies more accurately than previous approaches.]]></summary>

(cryo-EM), the Multi-Reference Alignment (MRA) model entails the learning of an
unknown signal from repeated measurements of its images under the latent action
of a group of isometries and additive noise of magnitude $\sigma$. Despite
significant interest, a clear picture for understanding rates of estimation in
this model has emerged only recently, particularly in the high-noise regime
$\sigma \gg 1$ that is highly relevant in applications. Recent investigations
have revealed a remarkable asymptotic sample complexity of order $\sigma^6$ for
certain signals whose Fourier transforms have full support, in stark contrast
to the traditional $\sigma^2$ that arise in regular models. Often prohibitively
large in practice, these results have prompted the investigation of variations
around the MRA model where better sample complexity may be achieved. In this
paper, we show that \emph{sparse} signals exhibit an intermediate $\sigma^4$
sample complexity even in the classical MRA model. Our results explore and
exploit connections of the MRA estimation problem with two classical topics in
applied mathematics: the \textit{beltway problem} from combinatorial

tool in designing and controlling the nonlinear system. Different entropy
measures exist in the literature to analyze the predictability and complexity
of time series. However, the existed methods have some drawbacks related to a
strong dependence of entropy on the parameters of the methods, as well as on
the length and amplitude of the time series. To overcome these difficulties,
this study proposes a new method for estimating the entropy of a time series
using the LogNNet neural network model. The LogNNet reservoir matrix is filled
with the time series elements according to our algorithm. The network is
trained on MNIST-10 dataset and the classification accuracy is calculated. The
accuracy is considered as the entropy measure and denoted by NNetEn. The
novelty of entropy calculation is that the time series is involved in mixing
the input information in the reservoir. The greater complexity of the time
series leads to the better ability of the neural network to learn, and to the
higher classification accuracy and NNetEn values. The epochs number in the
training process of LogNNet is considered as the control parameter. We
introduce a new time series characteristic, called time series learning
inertia, that determines the learning rate of the neural network. The
robustness and efficiency of the method is verified on chaotic, periodic,
random, binary and constant time series. The comparison of NNetEn with other
methods of entropy estimation demonstrates that our method is more robust and
accurate and can be widely used in practice.]]></summary>

assessment and uncertainty quantification in PHM-XAI domain. Research articles
associated with the subject, from 2015 to 2021 were selected from five known
databases following PRISMA guidelines. Data was then extracted from the
selected articles and examined. Several findings were synthesized. Firstly,
while the discipline is still young, the analysis indicated the growing
acceptance of XAI in PHM domain. Secondly, XAI functions as a double edge
sword, where it is assimilated as a tool to execute PHM tasks as well as a mean
of explanation, particularly in diagnostic and anomaly detection activities,
implying a real need for XAI in PHM. Thirdly, the review showed that PHM-XAI
papers produce either good or excellent result in general, suggesting that PHM
performance is unaffected by XAI. Fourthly, human role, evaluation metrics and
uncertainty management are areas requiring further attention by the PHM
community. Adequate assessment metrics to cater for PHM need are urgently
needed.Finally, most case study featured on the accepted articles are based on

(CRMAB). The constraints are in the form of time varying set of actions (set of
available arms). This variation can be either stochastic or semi-deterministic.
Given a set of arms, a fixed number of them can be chosen to be played in each
decision interval. The play of each arm yields a state dependent reward. The
current states of arms are partially observable through binary feedback signals
from arms that are played. The current availability of arms is fully
observable. The objective is to maximize long term cumulative reward. The
uncertainty about future availability of arms along with partial state
information makes this objective challenging. Applications for CRMAB can be
found in resource allocation in cyber-physical systems involving components
with time varying availability.

First, this optimization problem is analyzed using Whittle's index policy. To
this end, a constrained restless single-armed bandit is studied. It is shown to
admit a threshold-type optimal policy and is also indexable. An algorithm to
compute Whittle's index is presented. An alternate solution method with lower
complexity is also presented in the form of an online rollout policy. A
detailed discussion on the complexity of both these schemes is also presented,
which suggests that online rollout policy with short look ahead is simpler to
implement than Whittle's index computation. Further, upper bounds on the value
function are derived in order to estimate the degree of sub-optimality of
various solutions. The simulation study compares the performance of Whittle's
index, online rollout, myopic and modified Whittle's index policies.]]></summary>

strategies to achieve the net emissions reductions that would be required to
follow a pathway that limits global warming to 1.5{\deg}C with no or limited
overshoot. The transition towards a carbon-free society goes through an
inevitable increase in the share of renewable generation in the energy mix and
a drastic decrease in the total consumption of fossil fuels. Therefore, this
thesis studies the integration of renewables in power systems by investigating
forecasting and decision-making tools. Indeed, in contrast to conventional
power plants, renewable energy is subject to uncertainty. Most of the
generation technologies based on renewable sources are non-dispatchable, and
their production is stochastic and complex to predict in advance. A high share
of renewables is challenging for power systems that have been designed and
sized for dispatchable units. In this context, probabilistic forecasts, which
aim at modeling the distribution of all possible future realizations, have
become a vital tool to equip decision-makers, hopefully leading to better
decisions in energy applications. This thesis focuses on two main research
questions: (1) How to produce reliable probabilistic renewable generation
forecasts, consumption, and electricity prices? (2) How to make decisions with
uncertainty using probabilistic forecasts? The thesis perimeter is the energy
management of "small" systems such as microgrids at a residential scale on a
day-ahead basis. It is divided into two main parts to propose directions to
address both research questions (1) a forecasting part; (2) a planning and

"content" image, to share similar texture and colors of a target "style" image.
Ideally, the style transfer manipulation should also preserve the semantic
content of the source image. A commonly used approach to assist in transferring
styles is based on Gram matrix optimization. One problem of Gram matrix-based
optimization is that it does not consider the correlation between colors and
their styles. Specifically, certain textures or structures should be associated
with specific colors. This is particularly challenging when the target style
image exhibits multiple style types. In this work, we propose a color-aware
multi-style transfer method that generates aesthetically pleasing results while
preserving the style-color correlation between style and generated images. We
achieve this desired outcome by introducing a simple but efficient modification
to classic Gram matrix-based style transfer optimization. A nice feature of our
method is that it enables the users to manually select the color associations
between the target style and content image for more transfer flexibility. We
validated our method with several qualitative comparisons, including a user
study conducted with 30 participants. In comparison with prior work, our method
is simple, easy to implement, and achieves visually appealing results when
targeting images that have multiple styles. Source code is available at

computer vision datasets. While the impact of label noise on learning in deep
neural networks has been studied in prior work, these studies have exclusively
focused on homogeneous label noise, i.e., the degree of label noise is the same
across all categories. However, in the real-world, label noise is often
heterogeneous, with some categories being affected to a greater extent than
others. Here, we address this gap in the literature. We hypothesized that
heterogeneous label noise would only affect the classes that had label noise
unless there was transfer from those classes to the classes without label
noise. To test this hypothesis, we designed a series of computer vision studies
using MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MS-COCO where we imposed heterogeneous
label noise during the training of multi-class, multi-task, and multi-label
systems. Our results provide evidence in support of our hypothesis: label noise
only affects the class affected by it unless there is transfer.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many works in the recent literature introduce semantic mapping methods that
use CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to recognize semantic properties in
images. The types of properties (eg.: room size, place category, and objects)
and their classes (eg.: kitchen and bathroom, for place category) are usually
predefined and restricted to a specific task. Thus, all the visual data
acquired and processed during the construction of the maps are lost and only
the recognized semantic properties remain on the maps. In contrast, this work
introduces a topological semantic mapping method that uses deep visual features
extracted by a CNN (GoogLeNet), from 2D images captured in multiple views of
the environment as the robot operates, to create, through averages,
consolidated representations of the visual features acquired in the regions
covered by each topological node. These representations allow flexible
recognition of semantic properties of the regions and use in other visual
tasks. Experiments with a real-world indoor dataset showed that the method is
able to consolidate the visual features of regions and use them to recognize
objects and place categories as semantic properties, and to indicate the
topological location of images, with very promising results.]]></summary>

algorithm for the FR case, using both support vector regression and feedforward
neural networks. We extend it to the NR case, using some different features but
similar learning, to develop a partially unified framework for VQA. When fully
trained, FR algorithms such as VMAF perform well on test datasets, with 90%+
match in PCC and SRCC; but for predicting performance in the wild, we
train/test from scratch for each database. With an 80/20 train/test split, we
still achieve 90%+ performance on average in both PCC and SRCC, with 8-9% gains
over VMAF. Moreover, we even get decent performance (~75%) if we ignore the
reference, treating FR as NR, partly justifying our attempts at unification. In
the true NR case, we reduce complexity vs. leading recent algorithms VIDEVAL,
RAPIQUE, yet achieve a stunning 90% in SRCC (~12% gain), while roughly matching
in PCC (78% vs. 79.6%). At lower complexities, we can still achieve 87% in

extracting a triangle mesh from a discretized implicit field. Classical MC is
defined by coarse tessellation templates isolated to individual cubes. While
more refined tessellations have been proposed, they all make heuristic
assumptions, such as trilinearity, when determining the vertex positions and
local mesh topologies in each cube. In principle, none of these approaches can
reconstruct geometric features that reveal coherence or dependencies between
nearby cubes (e.g., a sharp edge), as such information is unaccounted for,
resulting in poor estimates of the true underlying implicit field. To tackle
these challenges, we re-cast MC from a deep learning perspective, by designing
tessellation templates more apt at preserving geometric features, and learning
the vertex positions and mesh topologies from training meshes, to account for
contextual information from nearby cubes. We develop a compact per-cube
parameterization to represent the output triangle mesh, while being compatible
with neural processing, so that a simple 3D convolutional network can be
employed for the training. We show that all topological cases in each cube that
are applicable to our design can be easily derived using our representation,
and the resulting tessellations can also be obtained naturally and efficiently
by following a few design guidelines. In addition, our network learns local
features with limited receptive fields, hence it generalizes well to new shapes
and new datasets. We evaluate our neural MC approach by quantitative and
qualitative comparisons to all well-known MC variants. In particular, we
demonstrate the ability of our network to recover sharp features such as edges
and corners, a long-standing issue of MC and its variants. Our network also
reconstructs local mesh topologies more accurately than previous approaches.]]></summary>

seen little use outside of older symbolic AI work and cognitive science. Our
goal is to revisit this approach to understand if it is viable for enabling a
hybrid neural-symbolic approach to learning as a differentiable component of a
deep learning architecture. HRRs today are not effective in a differentiable
solution due to numerical instability, a problem we solve by introducing a
projection step that forces the vectors to exist in a well behaved point in
space. In doing so we improve the concept retrieval efficacy of HRRs by over
$100\times$. Using multi-label classification we demonstrate how to leverage

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Knowledge graphs represented as RDF datasets are integral to many machine
learning applications. RDF is supported by a rich ecosystem of data management
systems and tools, most notably RDF database systems that provide a SPARQL
query interface. Surprisingly, machine learning tools for knowledge graphs do
not use SPARQL, despite the obvious advantages of using a database system. This
is due to the mismatch between SPARQL and machine learning tools in terms of
data model and programming style. Machine learning tools work on data in
tabular format and process it using an imperative programming style, while
SPARQL is declarative and has as its basic operation matching graph patterns to
RDF triples. We posit that a good interface to knowledge graphs from a machine
learning software stack should use an imperative, navigational programming
paradigm based on graph traversal rather than the SPARQL query paradigm based
on graph patterns. In this paper, we present RDFFrames, a framework that
provides such an interface. RDFFrames provides an imperative Python API that
gets internally translated to SPARQL, and it is integrated with the PyData
machine learning software stack. RDFFrames enables the user to make a sequence
of Python calls to define the data to be extracted from a knowledge graph
stored in an RDF database system, and it translates these calls into a compact
SPQARL query, executes it on the database system, and returns the results in a
standard tabular format. Thus, RDFFrames is a useful tool for data preparation
that combines the usability of PyData with the flexibility and performance of
RDF database systems.]]></summary>

the diagnostic criteria used and population under study. However, it remains
one of the most underdiagnosed and undertreated conditions in ophthalmology.
Many tests used in the diagnosis of DED rely on an experienced observer for
image interpretation, which may be considered subjective and result in
variation in diagnosis. Since artificial intelligence (AI) systems are capable
of advanced problem solving, use of such techniques could lead to more
objective diagnosis. Although the term `AI' is commonly used, recent success in
its applications to medicine is mainly due to advancements in the sub-field of
machine learning, which has been used to automatically classify images and
predict medical outcomes. Powerful machine learning techniques have been
harnessed to understand nuances in patient data and medical images, aiming for
consistent diagnosis and stratification of disease severity. This is the first
literature review on the use of AI in DED. We provide a brief introduction to
AI, report its current use in DED research and its potential for application in
the clinic. Our review found that AI has been employed in a wide range of DED
clinical tests and research applications, primarily for interpretation of
interferometry, slit-lamp and meibography images. While initial results are
promising, much work is still needed on model development, clinical testing and
standardisation.]]></summary>

widely used in natural language processing for learning text representations.
MLM trains a model to predict a random sample of input tokens that have been
replaced by a [MASK] placeholder in a multi-class setting over the entire
vocabulary. When pretraining, it is common to use alongside MLM other auxiliary
objectives on the token or sequence level to improve downstream performance
(e.g. next sentence prediction). However, no previous work so far has attempted
in examining whether other simpler linguistically intuitive or not objectives
can be used standalone as main pretraining objectives. In this paper, we
explore five simple pretraining objectives based on token-level classification
tasks as replacements of MLM. Empirical results on GLUE and SQuAD show that our
proposed methods achieve comparable or better performance to MLM using a
BERT-BASE architecture. We further validate our methods using smaller models,
showing that pretraining a model with 41% of the BERT-BASE's parameters,
BERT-MEDIUM results in only a 1% drop in GLUE scores with our best objective.]]></summary>

paradigm. FL entails some pressing needs for developing novel parameter

Stochastic-Sign SGD which utilizes novel stochastic-sign based gradient
compressors enabling the aforementioned properties in a unified framework. We
also present an error-feedback variant of the proposed Stochastic-Sign SGD

identify named entities from user queries as diverse surface form attribute
values and afterward transform them into formally canonical forms. Such a
problem consists of two phases: {named entity recognition (NER)} and {attribute
value normalization (AVN)}. However, existing works only focus on the NER phase
but neglect equally important AVN. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a
unified query attribute value extraction system in e-commerce search named
QUEACO, which involves both two phases. Moreover, by leveraging large-scale
weakly-labeled behavior data, we further improve the extraction performance
with less supervision cost. Specifically, for the NER phase, QUEACO adopts a
novel teacher-student network, where a teacher network that is trained on the
strongly-labeled data generates pseudo-labels to refine the weakly-labeled data
for training a student network. Meanwhile, the teacher network can be
dynamically adapted by the feedback of the student's performance on
strongly-labeled data to maximally denoise the noisy supervisions from the weak
labels. For the AVN phase, we also leverage the weakly-labeled
query-to-attribute behavior data to normalize surface form attribute values
from queries into canonical forms from products. Extensive experiments on a
real-world large-scale E-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of

learning architectures trained on multivariate time series signals. The
importance of the fixed-dimensional vector representation generated by the
single-head network has been demonstrated for industrial machinery condition
monitoring and predictive maintenance. However, processing heterogeneous sensor
signals with a single head may result in a model that cannot explicitly account
for the diversity in time-varying multivariate inputs. This work extends the
conventional single-head deep learning models to a more robust form by
developing context-specific heads to independently capture the inherent pattern
of each sensor reading in multivariate time series signals. Using the turbofan
aircraft engine benchmark dataset (CMAPSS), an extensive experiment is
performed to verify the effectiveness and benefits of multi-head fully
connected neurons, recurrent networks, convolution network, the
transformer-style stand-alone attention network, and their variants for
remaining useful life estimation. Moreover, the effect of different attention
mechanisms on the multi-head models is also evaluated. In addition, each
architecture's relative advantage and computational overhead are analyzed.
Results show that utilizing the attention layer is task-sensitive and
model-dependent, as it does not provide consistent improvement across the
models investigated. The result is further compared with five state-of-the-art
models, and the comparison shows that a relatively simple multi-head
architecture performs better than the state-of-the-art models. The results
presented in this study demonstrate the importance of multi-head models and
attention mechanisms to improved understanding of the remaining useful life of

diagnosis. Although previous attempts to classify sleep stages have achieved
high classification performance, several challenges remain open: 1) How to
effectively utilize time-varying spatial and temporal features from
multi-channel brain signals remains challenging. Prior works have not been able
to fully utilize the spatial topological information among brain regions. 2)
Due to the many differences found in individual biological signals, how to
overcome the differences of subjects and improve the generalization of deep
neural networks is important. 3) Most deep learning methods ignore the
interpretability of the model to the brain. To address the above challenges, we
propose a multi-view spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks (MSTGCN)
with domain generalization for sleep stage classification. Specifically, we
construct two brain view graphs for MSTGCN based on the functional connectivity
and physical distance proximity of the brain regions. The MSTGCN consists of
graph convolutions for extracting spatial features and temporal convolutions
for capturing the transition rules among sleep stages. In addition, attention
mechanism is employed for capturing the most relevant spatial-temporal
information for sleep stage classification. Finally, domain generalization and
MSTGCN are integrated into a unified framework to extract subject-invariant
sleep features. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that the

distributed fog nodes at the edge of the Internet, enabling compute-intensive
and latency-sensitive computing services for vehicles through task offloading.
However, a heterogeneous mobility environment introduces uncertainties in terms
of resource supply and demand, which are inevitable bottlenecks for the optimal
offloading decision. Also, these uncertainties bring extra challenges to task
offloading under the oblivious adversary attack and data privacy risks. In this
article, we develop a new adversarial online learning algorithm with bandit
feedback based on the adversarial multi-armed bandit theory, to enable scalable
and low-complexity offloading decision making. Specifically, we focus on
optimizing fog node selection with the aim of minimizing the offloading service
costs in terms of delay and energy. The key is to implicitly tune the
exploration bonus in the selection process and the assessment rules of the
designed algorithm, taking into account volatile resource supply and demand. We
theoretically prove that the input-size dependent selection rule allows to
choose a suitable fog node without exploring the sub-optimal actions, and also
an appropriate score patching rule allows to quickly adapt to evolving
circumstances, which reduce variance and bias simultaneously, thereby achieving
a better exploitation-exploration balance. Simulation results verify the

robustness of deep learning models against distribution shifts. However,
existing works focus on OoD algorithms, such as invariant risk minimization,
domain generalization, or stable learning, without considering the influence of
deep model architectures on OoD generalization, which may lead to sub-optimal
performance. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods search for architecture
based on its performance on the training data, which may result in poor
generalization for OoD tasks. In this work, we propose robust Neural
Architecture Search for OoD generalization (NAS-OoD), which optimizes the
architecture with respect to its performance on generated OoD data by gradient
descent. Specifically, a data generator is learned to synthesize OoD data by
maximizing losses computed by different neural architectures, while the goal
for architecture search is to find the optimal architecture parameters that
minimize the synthetic OoD data losses. The data generator and the neural
architecture are jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner, and the minimax
training process effectively discovers robust architectures that generalize
well for different distribution shifts. Extensive experimental results show
that NAS-OoD achieves superior performance on various OoD generalization
benchmarks with deep models having a much fewer number of parameters. In
addition, on a real industry dataset, the proposed NAS-OoD method reduces the
error rate by more than 70% compared with the state-of-the-art method,
demonstrating the proposed method's practicality for real applications.]]></summary>

traditional cloud based approach that requires data upload may not be feasible
due to communication bandwidth limitation as well as privacy and security
concerns of end users. To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving
edge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.
Specifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device
individually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge
server for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the
communications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to
federated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework
does not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder
can be trained independently at each edge device without any server
involvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users' data is protected by
transmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption. Experimental
results provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various
design parameters such as the data compression ratio of the autoencoder and the
model complexity.]]></summary>

and momentum where there is a need to draw insights from data while preserving
the data provider's privacy. However, one among other existing challenges in
the adoption of federated learning has been the lack of fair, transparent and
universally agreed incentivization schemes for rewarding the federated learning
contributors. Smart contracts on a blockchain network provide transparent,
immutable and independently verifiable proofs by all participants of the
network. We leverage this open and transparent nature of smart contracts on a
blockchain to define incentivization rules for the contributors, which is based
on a novel scalar quantity - federated contribution. Such a smart contract
based reward-driven model has the potential to revolutionize the federated
learning adoption in enterprises. Our contribution is two-fold: first is to
show how smart contract based blockchain can be a very natural communication
channel for federated learning. Second, leveraging this infrastructure, we can
show how an intuitive measure of each agents' contribution can be built and
integrated with the life cycle of the training and reward process.]]></summary>

multiple views of a shared context. Recent works intuitively apply contrastive
learning (CL) to learn representations, regarded as a pairwise manner, which is
still scalable: view-specific noise is not filtered in learning view-shared
representations; the fake negative pairs, where the negative terms are actually
within the same class as the positive, and the real negative pairs are
coequally treated; and evenly measuring the similarities between terms might
interfere with optimization. Importantly, few works research the theoretical
framework of generalized self-supervised multi-view learning, especially for
more than two views. To this end, we rethink the existing multi-view learning
paradigm from the information theoretical perspective and then propose a novel
information theoretical framework for generalized multi-view learning. Guided
by it, we build a multi-view coding method with a three-tier progressive
architecture, namely Information theory-guided heuristic Progressive Multi-view
Coding (IPMC). In the distribution-tier, IPMC aligns the distribution between
views to reduce view-specific noise. In the set-tier, IPMC builds self-adjusted
pools for contrasting, which utilizes a view filter to adaptively modify the
pools. Lastly, in the instance-tier, we adopt a designed unified loss to learn
discriminative representations and reduce the gradient interference.
Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate the superiority of IPMC over
state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

method providing multiplex molecular and functional information from the rodent
brain. It can be greatly augmented by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that
offers excellent soft-tissue contrast and high-resolution brain anatomy.
Nevertheless, registration of multi-modal images remains challenging, chiefly
due to the entirely different image contrast rendered by these modalities.
Previously reported registration algorithms mostly relied on manual
user-dependent brain segmentation, which compromised data interpretation and
accurate quantification. Here we propose a fully automated registration method
for MSOT-MRI multimodal imaging empowered by deep learning. The automated
workflow includes neural network-based image segmentation to generate suitable
masks, which are subsequently registered using an additional neural network.
Performance of the algorithm is showcased with datasets acquired by
cross-sectional MSOT and high-field MRI preclinical scanners. The automated
registration method is further validated with manual and half-automated

the top. Despite this, our community has not fully succeeded in adapting
machine learning tools to answer counterfactual queries. This work addresses
this challenge by showing how to implement twin network counterfactual
inference -- an alternative to abduction, action, & prediction counterfactual
inference -- with deep learning to estimate counterfactual queries. We show how
the graphical nature of twin networks makes them particularly amenable to deep
learning, yielding simple neural network architectures that, when trained, are
capable of counterfactual inference. Importantly, we show how to enforce known
identifiability constraints during training, ensuring the answer to each
counterfactual query is uniquely determined. We demonstrate our approach by

counterfactual queries that quantify the degree to which one event was a

modeling per se, e.g., for quick prototyping when classical maximum likelihood
approaches are challenging or not feasible. In an application from a COVID-19
setting, we utilize differentiable programming to quickly build and optimize a
flexible prediction model adapted to the data quality challenges at hand.
Specifically, we develop a regression model, inspired by delay differential
equations, that can bridge temporal gaps of observations in the central German
registry of COVID-19 intensive care cases for predicting future demand. With
this exemplary modeling challenge, we illustrate how differentiable programming
can enable simple gradient-based optimization of the model by automatic
differentiation. This allowed us to quickly prototype a model under time
pressure that outperforms simpler benchmark models. We thus exemplify the
potential of differentiable programming also outside deep learning
applications, to provide more options for flexible applied statistical

key roles in the biology of microbes. As the most abundant biological entities
on the planet, the number of discovered phages is only the tip of the iceberg.
Recently, many new phages have been revealed using high throughput sequencing,
particularly metagenomic sequencing. Compared to the fast accumulation of
phage-like sequences, there is a serious lag in taxonomic classification of
phages. High diversity, abundance, and limited known phages pose great
challenges for taxonomic analysis. In particular, alignment-based tools have
difficulty in classifying fast accumulating contigs assembled from metagenomic
data. Results: In this work, we present a novel semi-supervised learning model,
named PhaGCN, to conduct taxonomic classification for phage contigs. In this
learning model, we construct a knowledge graph by combining the DNA sequence
features learned by convolutional neural network (CNN) and protein sequence
similarity gained from gene-sharing network. Then we apply graph convolutional
network (GCN) to utilize both the labeled and unlabeled samples in training to
enhance the learning ability. We tested PhaGCN on both simulated and real
sequencing data. The results clearly show that our method competes favorably

high-performance neuromorphic computing due to their ultra-high execution speed
and low energy consumption. However, current learning protocols fail to provide
scalable and efficient solutions to photonic circuit optimization in practical
applications. In this work, we propose a novel on-chip learning framework to
release the full potential of ONNs for power-efficient in situ training.
Instead of deploying implementation-costly back-propagation, we directly
optimize the device configurations with computation budgets and power
constraints. We are the first to model the ONN on-chip learning as a
resource-constrained stochastic noisy zeroth-order optimization problem, and
propose a novel mixed-training strategy with two-level sparsity and power-aware
dynamic pruning to offer a scalable on-chip training solution in practical ONN
deployment. Compared with previous methods, we are the first to optimize over
2,500 optical components on chip. We can achieve much better optimization
stability, 3.7x-7.6x higher efficiency, and save >90% power under practical
device variations and thermal crosstalk.]]></summary>

when additional constraints are posed on the network or on its moralized graph.
More precisely, we consider the constraint that the network or its moralized
graph are close, in terms of vertex or edge deletions, to a sparse graph class
$\Pi$. For example, we show that learning an optimal network whose moralized
graph has vertex deletion distance at most $k$ from a graph with maximum degree
1 can be computed in polynomial time when $k$ is constant. This extends
previous work that gave an algorithm with such a running time for the vertex
deletion distance to edgeless graphs [Korhonen & Parviainen, NIPS 2015]. We
then show that further extensions or improvements are presumably impossible.
For example, we show that learning optimal networks where the network or its
moralized graph have maximum degree $2$ or connected components of size at most
$c$, $c\ge 3$, is NP-hard. Finally, we show that learning an optimal network
with at most $k$ edges in the moralized graph presumably has no $f(k)\cdot

most $k$ arcs can be computed in $2^{O(k)}\cdot |I|^{O(1)}$ time where $|I|$ is

challenges to current ensemble clustering research. To deal with the curse of
dimensionality, recently considerable efforts in ensemble clustering have been
made by means of different subspace-based techniques. However, besides the
emphasis on subspaces, rather limited attention has been paid to the potential
diversity in similarity/dissimilarity metrics. It remains a surprisingly open
problem in ensemble clustering how to create and aggregate a large population
of diversified metrics, and furthermore, how to jointly investigate the
multi-level diversity in the large populations of metrics, subspaces, and
clusters in a unified framework. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a
novel multidiversified ensemble clustering approach. In particular, we create a
large number of diversified metrics by randomizing a scaled exponential
similarity kernel, which are then coupled with random subspaces to form a large
set of metric-subspace pairs. Based on the similarity matrices derived from
these metric-subspace pairs, an ensemble of diversified base clusterings can
thereby be constructed. Further, an entropy-based criterion is utilized to
explore the cluster-wise diversity in ensembles, based on which three specific
ensemble clustering algorithms are presented by incorporating three types of
consensus functions. Extensive experiments are conducted on 30 high-dimensional
datasets, including 18 cancer gene expression datasets and 12 image/speech
datasets, which demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms over the
state-of-the-art. The source code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The problem of training with a small set of positive samples is known as
few-shot learning (FSL). It is widely known that traditional deep learning (DL)
algorithms usually show very good performance when trained with large datasets.
However, in many applications, it is not possible to obtain such a high number
of samples. In the image domain, typical FSL applications include those related
to face recognition. In the audio domain, music fraud or speaker recognition
can be clearly benefited from FSL methods. This paper deals with the
application of FSL to the detection of specific and intentional acoustic events
given by different types of sound alarms, such as door bells or fire alarms,
using a limited number of samples. These sounds typically occur in domestic
environments where many events corresponding to a wide variety of sound classes
take place. Therefore, the detection of such alarms in a practical scenario can
be considered an open-set recognition (OSR) problem. To address the lack of a
dedicated public dataset for audio FSL, researchers usually make modifications
on other available datasets. This paper is aimed at poviding the audio
recognition community with a carefully annotated dataset
(https://zenodo.org/record/3689288) for FSL in an OSR context comprised of 1360
clips from 34 classes divided into pattern sounds} and unwanted sounds. To
facilitate and promote research on this area, results with state-of-the-art
baseline systems based on transfer learning are also presented.]]></summary>

transport distances between treatment and control groups or, more generally,
between a source and target population. Our approach is model-free but can also
incorporate moments or any other important functions of covariates that the
researcher desires to balance. We find that the causal optimal transport
outperforms competitor methods when both the propensity score and outcome

referring to the past subsequence that is the closest to the current one. The
distance significance is introduced based on the online matrix profile, which
demonstrates a prominent pattern when an anomaly occurs. Another training-free
approach spectral residual is integrated into our approach to further enhance
the detection accuracy. Moreover, the proposed approach is sped up by at least
four times for long time series by the introduced cache strategy. In comparison
to the existing approaches, the online matrix profile makes a good trade-off

in reinforcement learning (RL). When it comes to modern complex tasks,
sophisticated reward functions are widely used to simplify policy learning yet
even a tiny adjustment on them is expensive to evaluate due to the drastically
increasing cost of training. To this end, we propose a hindsight reward
tweaking approach by designing a novel paradigm for deep reinforcement learning
to model the influences of reward functions within a near-optimal space. We
simply extend the input observation with a condition vector linearly correlated
with the effective environment reward parameters and train the model in a
conventional manner except for randomizing reward configurations, obtaining a
hyper-policy whose characteristics are sensitively regulated over the condition
space. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and study one of its
potential application in policy performance boosting with multiple MuJoCo

on randomly sampled targets, yet the same systems are later used to predict
user behavior sequentially from a fixed point in time. Simulating online
recommender system performance is notoriously difficult and the discrepancy
between online and offline behaviors is typically not accounted for in offline
evaluations. This disparity permits weaknesses to go unnoticed until the model
is deployed in a production setting. In this paper, we first demonstrate how
omitting temporal context when evaluating recommender system performance leads
to false confidence. To overcome this, we postulate that offline evaluation
protocols can only model real-life use-cases if they account for temporal
context. Next, we propose a training procedure to further embed the temporal
context in existing models. We use a multi-objective approach to introduce
temporal context into traditionally time-unaware recommender systems and
confirm its advantage via the proposed evaluation protocol. Finally, we
validate that the Pareto Fronts obtained with the added objective dominate
those produced by state-of-the-art models that are only optimized for accuracy
on three real-world publicly available datasets. The results show that
including our temporal objective can improve recall@20 by up to 20%.]]></summary>

vasculatures from fundus images help identify early signs of many crucial
illnesses such as diabetic retinopathy. Due to the varying shape, size, and
patterns of retinal vessels, along with artefacts and noises in fundus images,
no one-stage method can accurately segment retinal vessels. In this work, we
propose a multi-scale, multi-level attention embedded CNN architecture
((M)SLAe-Net) to address the issue of multi-stage processing for robust and
precise segmentation of retinal vessels. We do this by extracting features at
multiple scales and multiple levels of the network, enabling our model to
holistically extracts the local and global features. Multi-scale features are
extracted using our novel dynamic dilated pyramid pooling (D-DPP) module. We
also aggregate the features from all the network levels. These effectively
resolved the issues of varying shapes and artefacts and hence the need for
multiple stages. To assist in better pixel-level classification, we use the
Squeeze and Attention(SA) module, a smartly adapted version of the Squeeze and
Excitation(SE) module for segmentation tasks in our network to facilitate
pixel-group attention. Our unique network design and novel D-DPP module with
efficient task-specific loss function for thin vessels enabled our model for
better cross data performance. Exhaustive experimental results on DRIVE, STARE,
HRF, and CHASE-DB1 show the superiority of our method.]]></summary>

broader lens on fairness reveals that AI can serve a greater aspiration:
rooting out societal inequities from their source. Specifically, we focus on
inequities in health information, and aim to reduce bias in that domain using
AI. The AI algorithms under the hood of search engines and social media, many
of which are based on recommender systems, have an outsized impact on the
quality of medical and health information online. Therefore, embedding bias
detection and reduction into these recommender systems serving up medical and
health content online could have an outsized positive impact on patient
outcomes and wellbeing.

In this position paper, we offer the following contributions: (1) we propose
a novel framework of Fairness via AI, inspired by insights from medical
education, sociology and antiracism; (2) we define a new term, bisinformation,
which is related to, but distinct from, misinformation, and encourage
researchers to study it; (3) we propose using AI to study, detect and mitigate
biased, harmful, and/or false health information that disproportionately hurts
minority groups in society; and (4) we suggest several pillars and pose several
open problems in order to seed inquiry in this new space. While part (3) of
this work specifically focuses on the health domain, the fundamental computer
science advances and contributions stemming from research efforts in bias
reduction and Fairness via AI have broad implications in all areas of society.]]></summary>

important tests through approximations from some quadratic forms of symmetry
statistics, where the deterministic weight matrix characterizes the power

with data-adaptive weights, referred to as the binary expansion adaptive

approximated by an oracle weighted sum of symmetry statistics. The BEAST with
this oracle provides a benchmark of feasible power against any alternative by
leading all existing tests with a substantial margin. To approach this oracle

this work, we propose static and dynamic prediction models to analyze and
assess the areas with high wildfire risks in California by utilizing a
multitude of environmental data including population density, Normalized
Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), tree
mortality area, tree mortality number, and altitude. Moreover, we focus on a
better understanding of the impacts of different factors so as to inform
preventive actions. To validate our models and findings, we divide the land of
California into 4,242 grids of 0.1 degrees $\times$ 0.1 degrees in latitude and
longitude, and compute the risk of each grid based on spatial and temporal
conditions. To verify the generalizability of our models, we further expand the
scope of wildfire risk assessment from California to Washington without any
fine tuning. By performing counterfactual analysis, we uncover the effects of
several possible methods on reducing the number of high risk wildfires. Taken
together, our study has the potential to estimate, monitor, and reduce the

recognition rules are often learned based on various sources of information. On
the other hand, the recent deployment of facial recognition systems with uneven
predictive performances on different population segments highlights the
representativeness issues possibly induced by a naive aggregation of image
datasets. Indeed, sampling bias does not vanish simply by considering larger
datasets, and ignoring its impact may completely jeopardize the generalization
capacity of the learned prediction rules. In this paper, we show how biasing
models, originally introduced for nonparametric estimation in (Gill et al.,
1988), and recently revisited from the perspective of statistical learning
theory in (Laforgue and Cl\'emen\c{c}on, 2019), can be applied to remedy these
problems in the context of visual recognition. Based on the (approximate)
knowledge of the biasing mechanisms at work, our approach consists in
reweighting the observations, so as to form a nearly debiased estimator of the
target distribution. One key condition for our method to be theoretically valid
is that the supports of the distributions generating the biased datasets at
disposal must overlap, and cover the support of the target distribution. In
order to meet this requirement in practice, we propose to use a low dimensional
image representation, shared across the image databases. Finally, we provide
numerical experiments highlighting the relevance of our approach whenever the

enables decision-making under uncertainty. Classifier design aims at building
models from training data for representing feature-label distributions--either
explicitly or implicitly. In many scientific or clinical settings, training
data are typically limited, which makes designing accurate classifiers and
evaluating their classification error extremely challenging. While transfer
learning (TL) can alleviate this issue by incorporating data from relevant
source domains to improve learning in a different target domain, it has
received little attention for performance assessment, notably in error
estimation. In this paper, we fill this gap by investigating knowledge
transferability in the context of classification error estimation within a
Bayesian paradigm. We introduce a novel class of Bayesian minimum mean-square
error (MMSE) estimators for optimal Bayesian transfer learning (OBTL), which
enables rigorous evaluation of classification error under uncertainty in a
small-sample setting. Using Monte Carlo importance sampling, we employ the
proposed estimator to evaluate the classification accuracy of a broad family of
classifiers that span diverse learning capabilities. Experimental results based
on both synthetic data as well as real-world RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data show
that our proposed OBTL error estimation scheme clearly outperforms standard
error estimators, especially in a small-sample setting, by tapping into the
data from other relevant domains.]]></summary>

tasks. As they rapidly evolve, their escalating computation and memory demands
make it challenging to deploy them on resource-constrained edge devices. Though
extensive efficient accelerator designs, from traditional electronics to
emerging photonics, have been successfully demonstrated, they are still
bottlenecked by expensive memory accesses due to tremendous gaps between the
bandwidth/power/latency of electrical memory and computing cores. Previous
solutions fail to fully-leverage the ultra-fast computational speed of emerging
DNN accelerators to break through the critical memory bound. In this work, we
propose a general and unified framework to trade expensive memory transactions
with ultra-fast on-chip computations, directly translating to performance
improvement. We are the first to jointly explore the intrinsic correlations and
bit-level redundancy within DNN kernels and propose a multi-level in situ
generation mechanism with mixed-precision bases to achieve on-the-fly recovery
of high-resolution parameters with minimum hardware overhead. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our proposed joint method can boost the memory
efficiency by 10-20x with comparable accuracy over four state-of-the-art

applications. However, it is difficult to tell beforehand if a DNN receiving an
input will deliver the correct output since their decision criteria are usually
nontransparent. A DNN delivers the correct output if the input is within the
area enclosed by its generalization envelope. In this case, the information
contained in the input sample is processed reasonably by the network. It is of
large practical importance to assess at inference time if a DNN generalizes
correctly. Currently, the approaches to achieve this goal are investigated in
different problem set-ups rather independently from one another, leading to
three main research and literature fields: predictive uncertainty,
out-of-distribution detection and adversarial example detection. This survey
connects the three fields within the larger framework of investigating the
generalization performance of machine learning methods and in particular DNNs.
We underline the common ground, point at the most promising approaches and give
a structured overview of the methods that provide at inference time means to
establish if the current input is within the generalization envelope of a DNN.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We consider adversarial attacks to a black-box model when no queries are
allowed. In this setting, many methods directly attack surrogate models and
transfer the obtained adversarial examples to fool the target model. Plenty of
previous works investigated what kind of attacks to the surrogate model can
generate more transferable adversarial examples, but their performances are
still limited due to the mismatches between surrogate models and the target
model. In this paper, we tackle this problem from a novel angle -- instead of
using the original surrogate models, can we obtain a Meta-Surrogate Model (MSM)
such that attacks to this model can be easier transferred to other models? We
show that this goal can be mathematically formulated as a well-posed
(bi-level-like) optimization problem and design a differentiable attacker to
make training feasible. Given one or a set of surrogate models, our method can
thus obtain an MSM such that adversarial examples generated on MSM enjoy
eximious transferability. Comprehensive experiments on Cifar-10 and ImageNet
demonstrate that by attacking the MSM, we can obtain stronger transferable
adversarial examples to fool black-box models including adversarially trained
ones, with much higher success rates than existing methods. The proposed method
reveals significant security challenges of deep models and is promising to be
served as a state-of-the-art benchmark for evaluating the robustness of deep
models in the black-box setting.]]></summary>

in distribution to the training data. In an ideal case, Deep Learning models
would achieve Out-of-Distribution (OoD) Generalization, i.e. reliably make
predictions on out-of-distribution data. Yet in practice, models usually fail
to generalize well when facing a shift in distribution. Several methods were
thereby designed to improve the robustness of the features learned by a model
through Regularization- or Domain-Prediction-based schemes. Segmenting medical
images such as MRIs of the hippocampus is essential for the diagnosis and
treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. But these brain images often suffer
from distribution shift due to the patient's age and various pathologies
affecting the shape of the organ. In this work, we evaluate OoD Generalization
solutions for the problem of hippocampus segmentation in MR data using both
fully- and semi-supervised training. We find that no method performs reliably
in all experiments. Only the V-REx loss stands out as it remains easy to tune,
while it outperforms a standard U-Net in most cases.]]></summary>

data mining and learning tasks. GRL aims to capture the graph's structural
information and exploit it in combination with node and edge attributes to
compute low-dimensional representations. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
have been used in state-of-the-art GRL architectures, they have been shown to
suffer from over smoothing when many GNN layers need to be stacked. In a
different GRL approach, spectral methods based on graph filtering have emerged
addressing over smoothing; however, up to now, they employ traditional neural
networks that cannot efficiently exploit the structure of graph data. Motivated
by this, we propose PointSpectrum, a spectral method that incorporates a set
equivariant network to account for a graph's structure. PointSpectrum enhances
the efficiency and expressiveness of spectral methods, while it outperforms or
competes with state-of-the-art GRL methods. Overall, PointSpectrum addresses
over smoothing by employing a graph filter and captures a graph's structure
through set equivariance, lying on the intersection of GNNs and spectral
methods. Our findings are promising for the benefits and applicability of this

to the new reality, where people may wear surgical masks to cover their noses
and mouths. Traditional data sets (e.g., CelebA, CASIA-WebFace) used for
training these systems were released before the pandemic, so they now seem
unsuited due to the lack of examples of people wearing masks. We propose a
method for enhancing data sets containing faces without masks by creating
synthetic masks and overlaying them on faces in the original images. Our method
relies on Spark AR Studio, a developer program made by Facebook that is used to
create Instagram face filters. In our approach, we use 9 masks of different
colors, shapes and fabrics. We employ our method to generate a number of
445,446 (90%) samples of masks for the CASIA-WebFace data set and 196,254
(96.8%) masks for the CelebA data set, releasing the mask images at
https://github.com/securifai/masked_faces. We show that our method produces
significantly more realistic training examples of masks overlaid on faces by
asking volunteers to qualitatively compare it to other methods or data sets
designed for the same task. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our method by
evaluating state-of-the-art face recognition systems (FaceNet, VGG-face,

problem not only because of different distributions of each stream but also
because of rapidly changing and never-ending environments of data streams.
Albeit growing research achievements in this area, most of existing works are
developed for a single source domain which limits its resilience to exploit
multi-source domains being beneficial to recover from concept drifts quickly
and to avoid the negative transfer problem. An online domain adaptation
technique under multisource streaming processes, namely automatic online
multi-source domain adaptation (AOMSDA), is proposed in this paper. The online
domain adaptation strategy of AOMSDA is formulated under a coupled generative
and discriminative approach of denoising autoencoder (DAE) where the central
moment discrepancy (CMD)-based regularizer is integrated to handle the
existence of multi-source domains thereby taking advantage of complementary
information sources. The asynchronous concept drifts taking place at different
time periods are addressed by a self-organizing structure and a node
re-weighting strategy. Our numerical study demonstrates that AOMSDA is capable
of outperforming its counterparts in 5 of 8 study cases while the ablation
study depicts the advantage of each learning component. In addition, AOMSDA is
general for any number of source streams. The source code of AOMSDA is shared

the 21st century. As the virus continues to spread on a global scale, the
majority of efforts have been on the development of vaccines and the mass
immunization of the public. While the daily case numbers were following a
decreasing trend, the emergent of new virus mutations and variants still pose a
significant threat. As economies start recovering and societies start opening
up with people going back into office buildings, schools, and malls, we still
need to have the ability to detect and minimize the spread of COVID-19.
Individuals with COVID-19 may show multiple symptoms such as cough, fever, and
shortness of breath. Many of the existing detection techniques focus on
symptoms having the same equal importance. However, it has been shown that some
symptoms are more prevalent than others. In this paper, we present a multimodal
method to predict COVID-19 by incorporating existing deep learning classifiers
using convolutional neural networks and our novel probability-based weighting
function that considers the prevalence of each symptom. The experiments were
performed on an existing dataset with respect to the three considered modes of
coughs, fever, and shortness of breath. The results show considerable
improvements in the detection of COVID-19 using our weighting function when
compared to an equal weighting function.]]></summary>

generative models. GANs can learn complex multi-modal distributions, and
generate real-like samples. Despite the major success of GANs in generating
synthetic data, they might suffer from unstable training process, and mode
collapse. In this paper, we introduce a new GAN architecture called variance
enforcing GAN (VARGAN), which incorporates a third network to introduce
diversity in the generated samples. The third network measures the diversity of
the generated samples, which is used to penalize the generator's loss for low
diversity samples. The network is trained on the available training data and
undesired distributions with limited modality. On a set of synthetic and
real-world image data, VARGAN generates a more diverse set of samples compared
to the recent state-of-the-art models. High diversity and low computational
complexity, as well as fast convergence, make VARGAN a promising model to
alleviate mode collapse.]]></summary>

is possible to achieve high levels of compression with surprisingly little
degradation to test set accuracy. However, this measure of performance conceals
significant differences in how different classes and images are impacted by
model compression techniques. We find that models with radically different
numbers of weights have comparable top-line performance metrics but diverge
considerably in behavior on a narrow subset of the dataset. This small subset
of data points, which we term Pruning Identified Exemplars (PIEs) are
systematically more impacted by the introduction of sparsity. Compression
disproportionately impacts model performance on the underrepresented long-tail
of the data distribution. PIEs over-index on atypical or noisy images that are
far more challenging for both humans and algorithms to classify. Our work
provides intuition into the role of capacity in deep neural networks and the
trade-offs incurred by compression. An understanding of this disparate impact
is critical given the widespread deployment of compressed models in the wild.]]></summary>

that enjoy an approximation rate
$\mathcal{O}(\omega_f(\sqrt{d})\cdot2^{-M}+\omega_{f}\left(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{N}\right))$,
where $M,N\in \mathbb{N}^{+}$ denote the hyperparameters related to widths of

the depth $5$ and width
$\max\left\{\left\lceil2d^{3/2}\left(\frac{3\mu}{\epsilon}\right)^{1/{\alpha}}\right\rceil,2\left\lceil\log_2\frac{3\mu

it more practical in real-world tasks, but its relatively poor scalability and
the partially observable constraints raise challenges to its performance and
deployment. Based on our intuitive observation that the human society could be
regarded as a large-scale partially observable environment, where each
individual has the function of communicating with neighbors and remembering its
own experience, we propose a novel network structure called hierarchical graph
recurrent network(HGRN) for multi-agent cooperation under partial
observability. Specifically, we construct the multi-agent system as a graph,
use the hierarchical graph attention network(HGAT) to achieve communication
between neighboring agents, and exploit GRU to enable agents to record
historical information. To encourage exploration and improve robustness, we
design a maximum-entropy learning method to learn stochastic policies of a
configurable target action entropy. Based on the above technologies, we
proposed a value-based MADRL algorithm called Soft-HGRN and its actor-critic
variant named SAC-HRGN. Experimental results based on three homogeneous tasks
and one heterogeneous environment not only show that our approach achieves
clear improvements compared with four baselines, but also demonstrates the
interpretability, scalability, and transferability of the proposed model.
Ablation studies prove the function and necessity of each component.]]></summary>

medicine, the scarcity of labeled training data is a common issue. Also, these

approach for health data analysis, especially for computational phenotyping,
where the high-dimensional Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with patients
history of medical procedures, medications, diagnosis, lab tests, etc., are
converted to meaningful and interpretable medical concepts. Federated tensor
factorization distributes the tensor computation to multiple workers under the
coordination of a central server, which enables jointly learning the phenotypes
across multiple hospitals while preserving the privacy of the patient
information. However, existing federated tensor factorization algorithms
encounter the single-point-failure issue with the involvement of the central
server, which is not only easily exposed to external attacks, but also limits
the number of clients sharing information with the server under restricted
uplink bandwidth. In this paper, we propose CiderTF, a communication-efficient
decentralized generalized tensor factorization, which reduces the uplink
communication cost by leveraging a four-level communication reduction strategy
designed for a generalized tensor factorization, which has the flexibility of
modeling different tensor distribution with multiple kinds of loss functions.
Experiments on two real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that CiderTF achieves
comparable convergence with the communication reduction up to 99.99%.]]></summary>

perturbations of their input is becoming a topic of increasing importance. In
this paper, the random GCN is introduced for which a random matrix theory
analysis is possible. This analysis suggests that if the graph is sufficiently
perturbed, or in the extreme case random, then the GCN fails to benefit from
the node features. It is furthermore observed that enhancing the message
passing step in GCNs by adding the node feature kernel to the adjacency matrix
of the graph structure solves this problem. An empirical study of a GCN
utilised for node classification on six real datasets further confirms the
theoretical findings and demonstrates that perturbations of the graph structure
can result in GCNs performing significantly worse than Multi-Layer Perceptrons
run on the node features alone. In practice, adding a node feature kernel to
the message passing of perturbed graphs results in a significant improvement of
the GCN's performance, thereby rendering it more robust to graph perturbations.

calculated using the attention mechanism without direct supervision about their

and low-power operation. Its linear unit performs a multiplication of an input
vector and a weight matrix in optical analog circuits. Among them, a circuit
with a multiple-layered structure of programmable Mach-Zehnder interferometers
(MZIs) can realize a specific class of unitary matrices with a limited number
of MZIs as its weight matrix. The circuit is effective for balancing the number
of programmable MZIs and ONN performance. However, it takes a lot of time to
learn MZI parameters of the circuit with a conventional automatic
differentiation (AD), which machine learning platforms are equipped with. To
solve the time-consuming problem, we propose an acceleration method for
learning MZI parameters. We create customized complex-valued derivatives for an
MZI, exploiting Wirtinger derivatives and a chain rule. They are incorporated
into our newly developed function module implemented in C++ to collectively
calculate their values in a multi-layered structure. Our method is simple,
fast, and versatile as well as compatible with the conventional AD. We
demonstrate that our method works 20 times faster than the conventional AD when
a pixel-by-pixel MNIST task is performed in a complex-valued recurrent neural

implementations of over-the-air FEEL still suffer from several challenges,
including strong straggler issues, large communication overheads, and potential

increasing interest for their ability to perform fast approximation of
effective hydrodynamic parameters in porous media research and applications.
This paper presents a novel methodology for permeability prediction from
micro-CT scans of geological rock samples. The training data set for CNNs
dedicated to permeability prediction consists of permeability labels that are
typically generated by classical lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) that simulate
the flow through the pore space of the segmented image data. We instead perform
direct numerical simulation (DNS) by solving the stationary Stokes equation in
an efficient and distributed-parallel manner. As such, we circumvent the
convergence issues of LBM that frequently are observed on complex pore
geometries, and therefore, improve on the generality and accuracy of our
training data set. Using the DNS-computed permeabilities, a physics-informed
CNN PhyCNN) is trained by additionally providing a tailored characteristic
quantity of the pore space. More precisely, by exploiting the connection to
flow problems on a graph representation of the pore space, additional
information about confined structures is provided to the network in terms of
the maximum flow value, which is the key innovative component of our workflow.
As a result, unprecedented prediction accuracy and robustness are observed for
a variety of sandstone samples from archetypal rock formations.]]></summary>

function between two random variables, correntropy has been successfully
applied in robust machine learning and signal processing to combat large
outliers. The kernel function in correntropy is usually a zero-mean Gaussian
kernel. In a recent work, the concept of mixture correntropy (MC) was proposed
to improve the learning performance, where the kernel function is a mixture
Gaussian kernel, namely a linear combination of several zero-mean Gaussian
kernels with different widths. In both correntropy and mixture correntropy, the
center of the kernel function is, however, always located at zero. In the
present work, to further improve the learning performance, we propose the
concept of multi-kernel correntropy (MKC), in which each component of the
mixture Gaussian kernel can be centered at a different location. The properties
of the MKC are investigated and an efficient approach is proposed to determine
the free parameters in MKC. Experimental results show that the learning
algorithms under the maximum multi-kernel correntropy criterion (MMKCC) can
outperform those under the original maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) and the

segmentation from both MRI and CT scans. More specifically, the proposed model

sent to multiple 3D decoders that individually predict intermediate
segmentation maps. Finally, all segmentation maps are combined to obtain a
unique detailed segmentation mask. We test our model on both CT and MRI imaging
data: the publicly available NIH Pancreas-CT dataset (consisting of 82
contrast-enhanced CTs) and a private MRI dataset (consisting of 40 MRI scans).
Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing methods on CT
pancreas segmentation, obtaining an average Dice score of about 88%, and yields
promising segmentation performance on a very challenging MRI data set (average
Dice score is about 77%). Additional control experiments demonstrate that the
achieved performance is due to the combination of our 3D fully-convolutional

square-integrable variables in $\mathbb{R}^d$, with common expectation $\mu$
and covariance matrix $\Sigma$, both unknown. We consider the problem of
testing if $\mu$ is $\eta$-close to zero, i.e. $\|\mu\| \leq \eta $ against
$\|\mu\| \geq (\eta + \delta)$; we also tackle the more general two-sample mean
closeness testing problem. The aim of this paper is to obtain nonasymptotic
upper and lower bounds on the minimal separation distance $\delta$ such that we
can control both the Type I and Type II errors at a given level. The main
technical tools are concentration inequalities, first for a suitable estimator
of $\|\mu\|^2$ used a test statistic, and secondly for estimating the operator
and Frobenius norms of $\Sigma$ coming into the quantiles of said test
statistic. These properties are obtained for Gaussian and bounded
distributions. A particular attention is given to the dependence in the
pseudo-dimension $d_*$ of the distribution, defined as $d_* :=
\|\Sigma\|_2^2/\|\Sigma\|_\infty^2$. In particular, for $\eta=0$, the minimum
separation distance is ${\Theta}(d_*^{\frac{1}{4}}\sqrt{\|\Sigma\|_\infty/n})$,
in contrast with the minimax estimation distance for $\mu$, which is
${\Theta}(d_e^{\frac{1}{2}}\sqrt{\|\Sigma\|_\infty/n})$ (where
$d_e:=\|\Sigma\|_1/\|\Sigma\|_\infty$). This generalizes a phenomenon spelled

tasks, by simply reading textual instructions that define them and looking at a
few examples. NLP models built with the conventional paradigm, however, often
struggle with generalization across tasks (e.g., a question-answering system
cannot solve classification tasks). A long-standing challenge in AI is to build
a model that is equipped with the understanding of human-readable instructions
that define the tasks, and can generalize to new tasks. To study this, we
introduce NATURAL INSTRUCTIONS, a dataset of 61 distinct tasks, their

obtained from crowdsourcing instructions used to collect existing NLP datasets
and mapped to a unified schema. We adopt generative pre-trained language models

an effective architecture for scaling attention-based models to more parameters
with comparable computation cost. In this paper, we propose Sparse-MLP, scaling
the recent MLP-Mixer model with sparse MoE layers, to achieve a more
computation-efficient architecture. We replace a subset of dense MLP blocks in
the MLP-Mixer model with Sparse blocks. In each Sparse block, we apply two
stages of MoE layers: one with MLP experts mixing information within channels
along image patch dimension, one with MLP experts mixing information within
patches along the channel dimension. Besides, to reduce computational cost in
routing and improve experts capacity, we design Re-represent layers in each
Sparse block. These layers are to re-scale image representations by two simple
but effective linear transformations. By pre-training on ImageNet-1k with MoCo
v3 algorithm, our models can outperform dense MLP models with comparable
parameters and less computational cost on several downstream image
classification tasks.]]></summary>

Functional Areas (MFAs), i.e., the geographic zones highly interconnected

necessarily with administrative borders as they are built observing natural
human mobility and, therefore, they can be used to inform, in a bottom-up
approach, local transportation, spatial planning, health and economic policies.
After presenting the methodology behind the MFAs, this study focuses on the
link between the COVID-19 pandemic and the MFAs in Austria. It emerges that the
MFAs registered an average number of infections statistically larger than the
areas in the rest of the country, suggesting the usefulness of the MFAs in the
context of targeted re-escalation policy responses to this health crisis. The

concepts such as objects and actions, understanding semantics and language
grounding, and reasoning about the interplay between the two modalities. One
crucial aspect of visual reasoning is spatial understanding, which involves
understanding relative locations of objects, i.e.\ implicitly learning the
geometry of the scene. In this work, we evaluate the faithfulness of V\&L
models to such geometric understanding, by formulating the prediction of
pair-wise relative locations of objects as a classification as well as a
regression task. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art transformer-based
V\&L models lack sufficient abilities to excel at this task. Motivated by this,
we design two objectives as proxies for 3D spatial reasoning (SR) -- object
centroid estimation, and relative position estimation, and train V\&L with weak
supervision from off-the-shelf depth estimators. This leads to considerable
improvements in accuracy for the "GQA" visual question answering challenge (in
fully supervised, few-shot, and O.O.D settings) as well as improvements in
relative spatial reasoning. Code and data will be released

and is usually performed using crowd motion algorithms for which appropriate
parameter values need to be found. The study of the relation between parametric
values for simulation techniques and the quality of the resulting trajectories
has been studied either through perceptual experiments or by comparison with
real crowd trajectories. In this paper, we integrate both strategies. A quality
metric, QF, is proposed to abstract from reference data while capturing the
most salient features that affect the perception of trajectory realism. QF
weights and combines cost functions that are based on several individual, local
and global properties of trajectories. These trajectory features are selected
from the literature and from interviews with experts. To validate the capacity
of QF to capture perceived trajectory quality, we conduct an online experiment
that demonstrates the high agreement between the automatic quality score and
non-expert users. To further demonstrate the usefulness of QF, we use it in a
data-free parameter tuning application able to tune any parametric microscopic
crowd simulation model that outputs independent trajectories for characters.
The learnt parameters for the tuned crowd motion model maintain the influence
of the reference data which was used to weight the terms of QF.]]></summary>

generalization ability of neural networks. The companion baseline Transformers,
typically trained with default hyper-parameters from standard tasks, are shown
to fail dramatically. Here we demonstrate that by revisiting model
configurations as basic as scaling of embeddings, early stopping, relative
positional embedding, and Universal Transformer variants, we can drastically
improve the performance of Transformers on systematic generalization. We report
improvements on five popular datasets: SCAN, CFQ, PCFG, COGS, and Mathematics
dataset. Our models improve accuracy from 50% to 85% on the PCFG productivity
split, and from 35% to 81% on COGS. On SCAN, relative positional embedding
largely mitigates the EOS decision problem (Newman et al., 2020), yielding 100%
accuracy on the length split with a cutoff at 26. Importantly, performance
differences between these models are typically invisible on the IID data split.
This calls for proper generalization validation sets for developing neural
networks that generalize systematically. We publicly release the code to

and predict its next value; ii) equivalently, a function of the history which
can be recursively updated and is sufficient to compute the expected reward and
predict the next observation. An information state always leads to a dynamic
programming decomposition. Our key result is to show that if a function of the
history (called approximate information state (AIS)) approximately satisfies
the properties of the information state, then there is a corresponding
approximate dynamic program. We show that the policy computed using this is
approximately optimal with bounded loss of optimality. We show that several
approximations in state, observation and action spaces in literature can be
viewed as instances of AIS. In some of these cases, we obtain tighter bounds. A
salient feature of AIS is that it can be learnt from data. We present AIS based

the complexity of previously developed basic models. However, it is unclear
whether there is a way to boost performance by decreasing the complexity of
such models. Here, based on an optimization method, we investigate the
feasibility of improving graph classification performance while simplifying the
model learning process. Inspired by progress in structural information
assessment, we optimize the given data sample from graphs to encoding trees. In
particular, we minimize the structural entropy of the transformed encoding tree
to decode the key structure underlying a graph. This transformation is denoted
as structural optimization. Furthermore, we propose a novel feature combination
scheme, termed hierarchical reporting, for encoding trees. In this scheme,
features are transferred from leaf nodes to root nodes by following the
hierarchical structures of encoding trees. We then present an implementation of
the scheme in a tree kernel and a convolutional network to perform graph
classification. The tree kernel follows label propagation in the
Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) subtree kernel, but it has a lower runtime complexity
$O(n)$. The convolutional network is a special implementation of our tree
kernel in the deep learning field and is called Encoding Tree Learning (ETL).
We empirically validate our tree kernel and convolutional network with several
graph classification benchmarks and demonstrate that our methods achieve better

and no additional training data, we can produce a range of powerful editing
effects for reducing distraction in images. Given an image and a mask
specifying the region to edit, we backpropagate through a state-of-the-art
saliency model to parameterize a differentiable editing operator, such that the
saliency within the masked region is reduced. We demonstrate several operators,
including: a recoloring operator, which learns to apply a color transform that
camouflages and blends distractors into their surroundings; a warping operator,
which warps less salient image regions to cover distractors, gradually
collapsing objects into themselves and effectively removing them (an effect
akin to inpainting); a GAN operator, which uses a semantic prior to fully
replace image regions with plausible, less salient alternatives. The resulting
effects are consistent with cognitive research on the human visual system
(e.g., since color mismatch is salient, the recoloring operator learns to
harmonize objects' colors with their surrounding to reduce their saliency),
and, importantly, are all achieved solely through the guidance of the
pretrained saliency model, with no additional supervision. We present results
on a variety of natural images and conduct a perceptual study to evaluate and
validate the changes in viewers' eye-gaze between the original images and our

individual students as they go through online courses. This student performance
(SP) modeling problem, also known as knowledge tracing, is a critical step for
building adaptive online teaching systems. Specifically, we conduct a study of
how to utilize various types and large amounts of students log data to train
accurate machine learning models that predict the knowledge state of future
students. This study is the first to use four very large datasets made
available recently from four distinct intelligent tutoring systems. Our results
include a new machine learning approach that defines a new state of the art for
SP modeling, improving over earlier methods in several ways: First, we achieve
improved accuracy by introducing new features that can be easily computed from
conventional question-response logs (e.g., the pattern in the student's most
recent answers). Second, we take advantage of features of the student history
that go beyond question-response pairs (e.g., which video segments the student
watched, or skipped) as well as information about prerequisite structure in the
curriculum. Third, we train multiple specialized modeling models for different
aspects of the curriculum (e.g., specializing in early versus later segments of
the student history), then combine these specialized models to create a group
prediction of student knowledge. Taken together, these innovations yield an
average AUC score across these four datasets of 0.807 compared to the previous
best logistic regression approach score of 0.766, and also outperforming
state-of-the-art deep neural net approaches. Importantly, we observe consistent
improvements from each of our three methodological innovations, in each

produce improvements for other online tutoring systems as well.]]></summary>

make the first large-scale study concerning the task of Long-Tail Visual

structured visual relationships that come from the long-tail (e.g., "rabbit
grazing on grass"). In this setup, the subject, relation, and object classes
each follow a long-tail distribution. To begin our study and make a future
benchmark for the community, we introduce two LTVRR-related benchmarks, dubbed
VG8K-LT and GQA-LT, built upon the widely used Visual Genome and GQA datasets.
We use these benchmarks to study the performance of several state-of-the-art
long-tail models on the LTVRR setup. Lastly, we propose a visiolinguistic
hubless (VilHub) loss and a Mixup augmentation technique adapted to LTVRR
setup, dubbed as RelMix. Both VilHub and RelMix can be easily integrated on top
of existing models and despite being simple, our results show that they can
remarkably improve the performance, especially on tail classes. Benchmarks,

automated fashion. The best general AI algorithm designed by one individual is
different from that devised by another. The best performance records achieved
by different users are also different. An inevitable component of general AI is
tacit knowledge that depends upon user-specific comprehension of task
information and individual model design preferences that are related to user
technical experiences. Tacit knowledge affects model performance but cannot be
automatically optimized in general AI algorithms. In this paper, we propose
User-Oriented Smart General AI System under Causal Inference, abbreviated as
UOGASuCI, where UOGAS represents User-Oriented General AI System and uCI means
under the framework of causal inference. User characteristics that have a
significant influence upon tacit knowledge can be extracted from observed model
training experiences of many users in external memory modules. Under the
framework of causal inference, we manage to identify the optimal value of user
characteristics that are connected with the best model performance designed by
users. We make suggestions to users about how different user characteristics
can improve the best model performance achieved by users. By recommending
updating user characteristics associated with individualized tacit knowledge
comprehension and technical preferences, UOGAS helps users design models with
better performance.]]></summary>

environments to ensure safety without being overly cautious. Prior work
explored occlusion inference from observed social behaviors of road agents.
Inferring occupancy from agent behaviors is an inherently multimodal problem; a
driver may behave in the same manner for different occupancy patterns ahead of
them (e.g., a driver may move at constant speed in traffic or on an open road).
Past work, however, does not account for this multimodality, thus neglecting to
model this source of aleatoric uncertainty in the relationship between driver
behaviors and their environment. We propose an occlusion inference method that
characterizes observed behaviors of human agents as sensor measurements, and
fuses them with those from a standard sensor suite. To capture the aleatoric
uncertainty, we train a conditional variational autoencoder with a discrete
latent space to learn a multimodal mapping from observed driver trajectories to
an occupancy grid representation of the view ahead of the driver. Our method
handles multi-agent scenarios, combining measurements from multiple observed
drivers using evidential theory to solve the sensor fusion problem. Our
approach is validated on a real-world dataset, outperforming baselines and
demonstrating real-time capable performance. Our code is available at

models using image-level annotations. Despite of the success of previous works,
explorations on an effective training strategy for the saliency network and
accurate matches between image-level annotations and salient objects are still
inadequate. In this work, 1) we propose a self-calibrated training strategy by
explicitly establishing a mutual calibration loop between pseudo labels and
network predictions, liberating the saliency network from error-prone
propagation caused by pseudo labels. 2) we prove that even a much smaller
dataset (merely 1.8% of ImageNet) with well-matched annotations can facilitate
models to achieve better performance as well as generalizability. This sheds
new light on the development of WSOD and encourages more contributions to the
community. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
all the existing WSOD methods by adopting the self-calibrated strategy only.
Steady improvements are further achieved by training on the proposed dataset.
Additionally, our method achieves 94.7% of the performance of fully-supervised
methods on average. And what is more, the fully supervised models adopting our
predicted results as "ground truths" achieve successful results (95.6% for
BASNet and 97.3% for ITSD on F-measure), while costing only 0.32% of labeling

networks has been a fruitful source of improvement in machine learning. Adding
auxiliary losses to the main objective function is a general way of encoding
biases that can help networks learn better representations. However, since
auxiliary losses are minimized only on training data, they suffer from the same
generalization gap as regular task losses. Moreover, by adding a term to the
loss function, the model optimizes a different objective than the one we care
about. In this work we address both problems: first, we take inspiration from
\textit{transductive learning} and note that after receiving an input but
before making a prediction, we can fine-tune our networks on any unsupervised
loss. We call this process {\em tailoring}, because we customize the model to
each input to ensure our prediction satisfies the inductive bias. Second, we
formulate {\em meta-tailoring}, a nested optimization similar to that in
meta-learning, and train our models to perform well on the task objective after
adapting them using an unsupervised loss. The advantages of tailoring and
meta-tailoring are discussed theoretically and demonstrated empirically on a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Glioma is a common malignant brain tumor that shows distinct survival among
patients. The isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene mutation status provides
critical diagnostic and prognostic value for glioma and is now accepted as the
standard of care. A non-invasive prediction of IDH mutation based on the
pre-treatment MRI has crucial clinical significance. Machine learning and deep
learning models show reasonable performance in predicting IDH mutation status.
However, most models neglect the systematic brain alterations caused by tumor
invasion, where the infiltration along white matter tracts throughout the brain
is identified as a hallmark of glioma. Structural brain network provides an
effective tool to characterise brain organisation, which could be captured by
the graph neural networks (GNN) for a more accurate prediction of IDH mutation
status.

Here we propose a method to predict the IDH mutation using GNN, based on the
structural brain network of patients. Specifically, we firstly construct a
network template of healthy subjects, which consists of atlases of edges (white
matter tracts) and nodes (cortical and subcortical brain regions) to provide
regions of interest (ROI). Next, we employ autoencoders to extract the latent
multi-modal MRI features from the ROIs of the edge and node in patients. These
features of edge and node of brain networks are used to train a GNN
architecture in predicting IDH mutation status. The results show that the
proposed method outperforms the baseline models using 3D-CNN and 3D-DenseNet.
In addition, the model interpretation suggests its ability to identify the
tracts infiltrated by tumor and corresponds to clinical prior knowledge. In
conclusion, integrating brain networks with GNN offers a new avenue to study
brain lesions using computational neuroscience and computer vision approaches.]]></summary>

to act using only supervised learning techniques. Unlike traditional
algorithms, UDRL does not use reward prediction or search for an optimal
policy. Instead, it trains agents to follow commands such as "obtain so much
total reward in so much time." Many of its general principles are outlined in a
companion report; the goal of this paper is to develop a practical learning
algorithm and show that this conceptually simple perspective on agent training
can produce a range of rewarding behaviors for multiple episodic environments.
Experiments show that on some tasks UDRL's performance can be surprisingly
competitive with, and even exceed that of some traditional baseline algorithms
developed over decades of research. Based on these results, we suggest that
alternative approaches to expected reward maximization have an important role
to play in training useful autonomous agents.]]></summary>

traditional cloud based approach that requires data upload may not be feasible
due to communication bandwidth limitation as well as privacy and security
concerns of end users. To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving
edge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.
Specifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device
individually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge
server for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the
communications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to
federated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework
does not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder
can be trained independently at each edge device without any server
involvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users' data is protected by
transmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption. Experimental
results provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various
design parameters such as the data compression ratio of the autoencoder and the
model complexity.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From CNNs to attention mechanisms, encoding inductive biases into neural
networks has been a fruitful source of improvement in machine learning. Adding
auxiliary losses to the main objective function is a general way of encoding
biases that can help networks learn better representations. However, since
auxiliary losses are minimized only on training data, they suffer from the same
generalization gap as regular task losses. Moreover, by adding a term to the
loss function, the model optimizes a different objective than the one we care
about. In this work we address both problems: first, we take inspiration from
\textit{transductive learning} and note that after receiving an input but
before making a prediction, we can fine-tune our networks on any unsupervised
loss. We call this process {\em tailoring}, because we customize the model to
each input to ensure our prediction satisfies the inductive bias. Second, we
formulate {\em meta-tailoring}, a nested optimization similar to that in
meta-learning, and train our models to perform well on the task objective after
adapting them using an unsupervised loss. The advantages of tailoring and
meta-tailoring are discussed theoretically and demonstrated empirically on a
diverse set of examples.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Masked language modeling (MLM) is one of the key sub-tasks in vision-language
pretraining. In the cross-modal setting, tokens in the sentence are masked at
random, and the model predicts the masked tokens given the image and the text.
In this paper, we observe several key disadvantages of MLM in this setting.
First, as captions tend to be short, in a third of the sentences no token is
sampled. Second, the majority of masked tokens are stop-words and punctuation,
leading to under-utilization of the image. We investigate a range of
alternative masking strategies specific to the cross-modal setting that address
these shortcomings, aiming for better fusion of text and image in the learned
representation. When pre-training the LXMERT model, our alternative masking
strategies consistently improve over the original masking strategy on three
downstream tasks, especially in low resource settings. Further, our
pre-training approach substantially outperforms the baseline model on a
prompt-based probing task designed to elicit image objects. These results and
our analysis indicate that our method allows for better utilization of the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Segmenting each moving object instance in a scene is essential for many
applications. But like many other computer vision tasks, this task performs
well in optimal weather, but then adverse weather tends to fail. To be robust
in weather conditions, the usual way is to train network in data of given
weather pattern or to fuse multiple sensors. We focus on a new possibility,
that is, to improve its resilience to weather interference through the
network's structural design. First, we propose a novel FPN structure called
RiWFPN with a progressive top-down interaction and attention refinement module.
RiWFPN can directly replace other FPN structures to improve the robustness of
the network in non-optimal weather conditions. Then we extend SOLOV2 to capture
temporal information in video to learn motion information, and propose a moving
object instance segmentation network with RiWFPN called RiWNet. Finally, in
order to verify the effect of moving instance segmentation in different weather
disturbances, we propose a VKTTI-moving dataset which is a moving instance
segmentation dataset based on the VKTTI dataset, taking into account different
weather scenes such as rain, fog, sunset, morning as well as overcast. The
experiment proves how RiWFPN improves the network's resilience to adverse
weather effects compared to other FPN structures. We compare RiWNet to several
other state-of-the-art methods in some challenging datasets, and RiWNet shows
better performance especially under adverse weather conditions.]]></summary>

using deep learning technologies, its misuse is a well-known issue now.
Deepfakes can cause severe security and privacy issues as they can be used to
impersonate a person's identity in a video by replacing his/her face with
another person's face. Recently, a new problem of generating synthesized human
voice of a person is emerging, where AI-based deep learning models can
synthesize any person's voice requiring just a few seconds of audio. With the
emerging threat of impersonation attacks using deepfake audios and videos, a
new generation of deepfake detectors is needed to focus on both video and audio
collectively. A large amount of good quality datasets is typically required to
capture the real-world scenarios to develop a competent deepfake detector.
Existing deepfake datasets either contain deepfake videos or audios, which are
racially biased as well. Hence, there is a crucial need for creating a good
video as well as an audio deepfake dataset, which can be used to detect audio
and video deepfake simultaneously. To fill this gap, we propose a novel
Audio-Video Deepfake dataset (FakeAVCeleb) that contains not only deepfake
videos but also respective synthesized lip-synced fake audios. We generate this
dataset using the current most popular deepfake generation methods. We selected
real YouTube videos of celebrities with four racial backgrounds (Caucasian,
Black, East Asian, and South Asian) to develop a more realistic multimodal
dataset that addresses racial bias and further help develop multimodal deepfake
detectors. We performed several experiments using state-of-the-art detection

This assumption greatly simplifies the learning problem, factorizing the

forward model of the ego-vehicle. Our approach computes action-values for each
training trajectory using a tabular dynamic-programming evaluation of the
Bellman equations; these action-values in turn supervise the final vision-based

acts well in a dynamic and reactive world. At the time of writing, our method

applications. Over the last few years, the methods based on convolution neural
networks have made substantial progress. However, because of the large variety
of object scales, densities, and arbitrary orientations, the current detectors
struggle with the extraction of semantically strong features for small-scale
objects by a predefined convolution kernel. To address this problem, we propose
the rotation equivariant feature image pyramid network (REFIPN), an image
pyramid network based on rotation equivariance convolution. The proposed model
adopts single-shot detector in parallel with a lightweight image pyramid module
to extract representative features and generate regions of interest in an
optimization approach. The proposed network extracts feature in a wide range of
scales and orientations by using novel convolution filters. These features are
used to generate vector fields and determine the weight and angle of the
highest-scoring orientation for all spatial locations on an image. By this
approach, the performance for small-sized object detection is enhanced without
sacrificing the performance for large-sized object detection. The performance
of the proposed model is validated on two commonly used aerial benchmarks and
the results show our proposed model can achieve state-of-the-art performance
with satisfactory efficiency.]]></summary>

tremendous amount of work in detecting coughs from audio but there has been no
effort to identify coughs from solely inertial measurement unit (IMU). Coughing
causes motion across the whole body and especially on the neck and head.
Therefore, head motion data during coughing captured by a head-worn IMU sensor
could be leveraged to detect coughs using a template matching algorithm. In
time series template matching problems, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) combined with
elastic distance measurement (esp. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)) achieves
outstanding performance. However, it is often regarded as prohibitively
time-consuming. Nearest Centroid Classifier is thereafter proposed. But the
accuracy is comprised of only one centroid obtained for each class.
Centroid-based Classifier performs clustering and averaging for each cluster,
but requires manually setting the number of clusters. We propose a novel
self-tuning multi-centroid template-matching algorithm, which can automatically
adjust the number of clusters to balance accuracy and inference time. Through
experiments conducted on synthetic datasets and a real-world earbud-based cough
dataset, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm and present
the result of cough detection with a single accelerometer sensor on the earbuds
platform.]]></summary>

parameters from a single input image, such as the vanishing points, focal
length, and horizon line. In this work, we propose Camera calibration
TRansformer with Line-Classification (CTRL-C), an end-to-end neural
network-based approach to single image camera calibration, which directly
estimates the camera parameters from an image and a set of line segments. Our
network adopts the transformer architecture to capture the global structure of
an image with multi-modal inputs in an end-to-end manner. We also propose an
auxiliary task of line classification to train the network to extract the
global geometric information from lines effectively. Our experiments
demonstrate that CTRL-C outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods on
the Google Street View and SUN360 benchmark datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Network quantization, which aims to reduce the bit-lengths of the network
weights and activations, has emerged for their deployments to resource-limited
devices. Although recent studies have successfully discretized a full-precision
network, they still incur large quantization errors after training, thus giving
rise to a significant performance gap between a full-precision network and its
quantized counterpart. In this work, we propose a novel quantization method for
neural networks, Cluster-Promoting Quantization (CPQ) that finds the optimal
quantization grids while naturally encouraging the underlying full-precision
weights to gather around those quantization grids cohesively during training.
This property of CPQ is thanks to our two main ingredients that enable
differentiable quantization: i) the use of the categorical distribution
designed by a specific probabilistic parametrization in the forward pass and
ii) our proposed multi-class straight-through estimator (STE) in the backward
pass. Since our second component, multi-class STE, is intrinsically biased, we
additionally propose a new bit-drop technique, DropBits, that revises the
standard dropout regularization to randomly drop bits instead of neurons. As a
natural extension of DropBits, we further introduce the way of learning
heterogeneous quantization levels to find proper bit-length for each layer by
imposing an additional regularization on DropBits. We experimentally validate
our method on various benchmark datasets and network architectures, and also
support a new hypothesis for quantization: learning heterogeneous quantization
levels outperforms the case using the same but fixed quantization levels from
scratch.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The optic nerve head represents the intraocular section of the optic nerve
(ONH), which is prone to damage by intraocular pressure. The advent of optical
coherence tomography (OCT) has enabled the evaluation of novel optic nerve head
parameters, namely the depth and curvature of the lamina cribrosa (LC).
Together with the Bruch's membrane opening minimum-rim-width, these seem to be
promising optic nerve head parameters for diagnosis and monitoring of retinal
diseases such as glaucoma. Nonetheless, these optical coherence tomography
derived biomarkers are mostly extracted through manual segmentation, which is
time-consuming and prone to bias, thus limiting their usability in clinical
practice. The automatic segmentation of optic nerve head in OCT scans could
further improve the current clinical management of glaucoma and other diseases.

This review summarizes the current state-of-the-art in automatic segmentation
of the ONH in OCT. PubMed and Scopus were used to perform a systematic review.
Additional works from other databases (IEEE, Google Scholar and ARVO IOVS) were
also included, resulting in a total of 27 reviewed studies.

For each algorithm, the methods, the size and type of dataset used for
validation, and the respective results were carefully analyzed. The results
show that deep learning-based algorithms provide the highest accuracy,
sensitivity and specificity for segmenting the different structures of the ONH
including the LC. However, a lack of consensus regarding the definition of
segmented regions, extracted parameters and validation approaches has been
observed, highlighting the importance and need of standardized methodologies
for ONH segmentation.]]></summary>

a crucial step for cardiac morphology and function analysis. However, automatic
RV segmentation from MRI is still challenging, mainly due to the heterogeneous
intensity, the complex variable shapes, and the unclear RV boundary. Moreover,
current methods for the RV segmentation tend to suffer from performance
degradation at the basal and apical slices of MRI. In this work, we propose an
automatic RV segmentation framework, where the information from long-axis (LA)
views is utilized to assist the segmentation of short-axis (SA) views via
information transition. Specifically, we employed the transformed segmentation
from LA views as a prior information, to extract the ROI from SA views for
better segmentation. The information transition aims to remove the surrounding
ambiguous regions in the SA views. %, such as the tricuspid valve regions. We
tested our model on a public dataset with 360 multi-center, multi-vendor and
multi-disease subjects that consist of both LA and SA MRIs. Our experimental
results show that including LA views can be effective to improve the accuracy
of the SA segmentation. Our model is publicly available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sampling methods (e.g., node-wise, layer-wise, or subgraph) has become an
indispensable strategy to speed up training large-scale Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs). However, existing sampling methods are mostly based on the graph
structural information and ignore the dynamicity of optimization, which leads
to high variance in estimating the stochastic gradients. The high variance
issue can be very pronounced in extremely large graphs, where it results in
slow convergence and poor generalization. In this paper, we theoretically
analyze the variance of sampling methods and show that, due to the composite
structure of empirical risk, the variance of any sampling method can be
decomposed into \textit{embedding approximation variance} in the forward stage
and \textit{stochastic gradient variance} in the backward stage that
necessities mitigating both types of variance to obtain faster convergence
rate. We propose a decoupled variance reduction strategy that employs
(approximate) gradient information to adaptively sample nodes with minimal
variance, and explicitly reduces the variance introduced by embedding
approximation. We show theoretically and empirically that the proposed method,
even with smaller mini-batch sizes, enjoys a faster convergence rate and
entails a better generalization compared to the existing methods.]]></summary>

explanation that deduces not only the important features of an input space but
also how those features should be modified to classify input as a target class
has gained an increasing interest. The patterns that deep networks have learned
from a training dataset can be grasped by observing the feature variation among
various classes. However, current approaches perform the feature modification
to increase the classification probability for the target class irrespective of
the internal characteristics of deep networks. This often leads to unclear
explanations that deviate from real-world data distributions. To address this
problem, we propose a counterfactual explanation method that exploits the
statistics learned from a training dataset. Especially, we gradually construct
an explanation by iterating over masking and composition steps. The masking
step aims to select an important feature from the input data to be classified
as a target class. Meanwhile, the composition step aims to optimize the
previously selected feature by ensuring that its output score is close to the
logit space of the training data that are classified as the target class.
Experimental results show that our method produces human-friendly
interpretations on various classification datasets and verify that such
interpretations can be achieved with fewer feature modification.]]></summary>

is possible to achieve high levels of compression with surprisingly little

significant differences in how different classes and images are impacted by

numbers of weights have comparable top-line performance metrics but diverge
considerably in behavior on a narrow subset of the dataset. This small subset
of data points, which we term Pruning Identified Exemplars (PIEs) are
systematically more impacted by the introduction of sparsity. Compression
disproportionately impacts model performance on the underrepresented long-tail

far more challenging for both humans and algorithms to classify. Our work
provides intuition into the role of capacity in deep neural networks and the
trade-offs incurred by compression. An understanding of this disparate impact

Building on the formal quantum-like nature of such interactions, we present a

between pairs of columns of a table. Generally, RE models for this task require
labelled tables for training. These labelled tables can also be generated
artificially from a Knowledge Graph (KG), which makes the cost to acquire them
much lower in comparison to manual annotations. However, unlike real tables,
these synthetic tables lack associated metadata, such as, column-headers,
captions, etc; this is because synthetic tables are created out of KGs that do
not store such metadata. Meanwhile, previous works have shown that metadata is
important for accurate RE from tables. To address this issue, we propose
methods to artificially create some of this metadata for synthetic tables.
Afterward, we experiment with a BERT-based model, in line with recently
published works, that takes as input a combination of proposed artificial
metadata and table content. Our empirical results show that this leads to an
improvement of 9\%-45\% in F1 score, in absolute terms, over 2 tabular

different pre-training tasks, different semantic granularities and different
model architectures. Few models consider expanding BERT from different text
formats. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous knowledge language model
(HKLM), a unified pre-trained language model (PLM) for all forms of text,
including unstructured text, semi-structured text and well-structured text. To
capture the corresponding relations among these multi-format knowledge, our
approach uses masked language model objective to learn word knowledge, uses
triple classification objective and title matching objective to learn entity
knowledge and topic knowledge respectively. To obtain the aforementioned
multi-format text, we construct a corpus in the tourism domain and conduct
experiments on 5 tourism NLP datasets. The results show that our approach
outperforms the pre-training of plain text using only 1/4 of the data. The
code, datasets, corpus and knowledge graph will be released.]]></summary>

and relevance models in search and recommendation. Considerations such as
latency and interpretability dictate the use of as few features as possible to
train these models. Feature selection in GBDT models typically involves
heuristically ranking the features by importance and selecting the top few, or
by performing a full backward feature elimination routine. On-the-fly feature
selection methods proposed previously scale suboptimally with the number of
features, which can be daunting in high dimensional settings. We develop a
scalable forward feature selection variant for GBDT, via a novel group testing
procedure that works well in high dimensions, and enjoys favorable theoretical
performance and computational guarantees. We show via extensive experiments on
both public and proprietary datasets that the proposed method offers
significant speedups in training time, while being as competitive as existing
GBDT methods in terms of model performance metrics. We also extend the method
to the multitask setting, allowing the practitioner to select common features
across tasks, as well as selecting task-specific features.]]></summary>

its readability. It is essential desirable for outputs from text generation
systems like summarization, question answering, machine translation, question
generation, table-to-text, etc. An automated coherence scoring model is also
helpful in essay scoring or providing writing feedback. A large body of
previous work has leveraged entity-based methods, syntactic patterns, discourse
relations, and more recently traditional deep learning architectures for text
coherence assessment. Previous work suffers from drawbacks like the inability
to handle long-range dependencies, out-of-vocabulary words, or model sequence
information. We hypothesize that coherence assessment is a cognitively complex
task that requires deeper models and can benefit from other related tasks.
Accordingly, in this paper, we propose four different Transformer-based
architectures for the task: vanilla Transformer, hierarchical Transformer,
multi-task learning-based model, and a model with fact-based input
representation. Our experiments with popular benchmark datasets across multiple
domains on four different coherence assessment tasks demonstrate that our
models achieve state-of-the-art results outperforming existing models by a good
margin.]]></summary>

defense methods against various adversarial attacks. To our knowledge, existing
AT-based methods usually train with the locally most adversarial perturbed
points and treat all the perturbed points equally, which may lead to
considerably weaker adversarial robust generalization on test data. In this
work, we introduce a new adversarial training framework that considers the
diversity as well as characteristics of the perturbed points in the vicinity of
benign samples. To realize the framework, we propose a Regional Adversarial
Training (RAT) defense method that first utilizes the attack path generated by
the typical iterative attack method of projected gradient descent (PGD), and
constructs an adversarial region based on the attack path. Then, RAT samples
diverse perturbed training points efficiently inside this region, and utilizes
a distance-aware label smoothing mechanism to capture our intuition that
perturbed points at different locations should have different impact on the
model performance. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show
that RAT consistently makes significant improvement on standard adversarial
training (SAT), and exhibits better robust generalization.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SARS-CoV-2, like any other virus, continues to mutate as it spreads,
according to an evolutionary process. Unlike any other virus, the number of
currently available sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in public databases such as GISAID
is already several million. This amount of data has the potential to uncover
the evolutionary dynamics of a virus like never before. However, a million is
already several orders of magnitude beyond what can be processed by the
traditional methods designed to reconstruct a virus's evolutionary history,
such as those that build a phylogenetic tree. Hence, new and scalable methods
will need to be devised in order to make use of the ever increasing number of
viral sequences being collected.

Since identifying variants is an important part of understanding the
evolution of a virus, in this paper, we propose an approach based on clustering
sequences to identify the current major SARS-CoV-2 variants. Using a $k$-mer
based feature vector generation and efficient feature selection methods, our
approach is effective in identifying variants, as well as being efficient and
scalable to millions of sequences. Such a clustering method allows us to show
the relative proportion of each variant over time, giving the rate of spread of
each variant in different locations -- something which is important for vaccine
development and distribution. We also compute the importance of each amino acid
position of the spike protein in identifying a given variant in terms of
information gain. Positions of high variant-specific importance tend to agree
with those reported by the USA's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

(DGP) regression. We construct the DGP by hierarchically putting transformed
Gaussian process (GP) priors on the length scales and magnitudes of the next
level of Gaussian processes in the hierarchy. The idea of the state-space
approach is to represent the DGP as a non-linear hierarchical system of linear
stochastic differential equations (SDEs), where each SDE corresponds to a
conditional GP. The DGP regression problem then becomes a state estimation
problem, and we can estimate the state efficiently with sequential methods by
using the Markov property of the state-space DGP. The computational complexity
scales linearly with respect to the number of measurements. Based on this, we
formulate state-space MAP as well as Bayesian filtering and smoothing solutions
to the DGP regression problem. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed
models and methods on synthetic non-stationary signals and apply the
state-space DGP to detection of the gravitational waves from LIGO measurements.]]></summary>

spatial data collected from multiple different sources. Efficacy of proper
facility planning depends on choice of candidates where fire stations can be
located along with existing stations, if any. Also, the travel time from these
candidates to demand locations need to be taken care of to maintain fire safety
standard. Here, we propose a travel time based clustering technique to identify
suitable candidates. Finally, we develop an optimization problem to select best
locations to install new fire stations. Our optimization problem is built upon
maximum coverage problem, based on integer programming. We present a detailed
experimental study of our proposed approach in collaboration with city of

tackling several problems in computer vision, computer-aided diagnosis, and
related fields. While prior studies have focused on boosting the model
accuracy, quantifying the reproducibility of the most discriminative features
identified by GNNs is still an intact problem that yields concerns about their
reliability in clinical applications in particular. Specifically, the
reproducibility of biological markers across clinical datasets and distribution
shifts across classes (e.g., healthy and disordered brains) is of paramount
importance in revealing the underpinning mechanisms of diseases as well as
propelling the development of personalized treatment. Motivated by these
issues, we propose, for the first time, reproducibility-based GNN selection
(RG-Select), a framework for GNN reproducibility assessment via the
quantification of the most discriminative features (i.e., biomarkers) shared
between different models. To ascertain the soundness of our framework, the
reproducibility assessment embraces variations of different factors such as
training strategies and data perturbations. Despite these challenges, our
framework successfully yielded replicable conclusions across different training
strategies and various clinical datasets. Our findings could thus pave the way
for the development of biomarker trustworthiness and reliability assessment
methods for computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis tasks. RG-Select code is

computational solutions that are both effective and efficient. A common
approach is to represent data objects as binary vectors, denoted \textit{hash
codes}, which require little storage and enable efficient similarity search
through direct indexing into a hash table or through similarity computations in
an appropriate space. Due to the limited expressibility of hash codes, compared
to real-valued representations, a core open challenge is how to generate hash
codes that well capture semantic content or latent properties using a small
number of bits, while ensuring that the hash codes are distributed in a way
that does not reduce their search efficiency. State of the art methods use
representation learning for generating such hash codes, focusing on neural
autoencoder architectures where semantics are encoded into the hash codes by
learning to reconstruct the original inputs of the hash codes. This thesis
addresses the above challenge and makes a number of contributions to
representation learning that (i) improve effectiveness of hash codes through
more expressive representations and a more effective similarity measure than
the current state of the art, namely the Hamming distance, and (ii) improve
efficiency of hash codes by learning representations that are especially suited
to the choice of search method. The contributions are empirically validated on
several tasks related to similarity search and recommendation.]]></summary>

clinical practice for the assessment of cardiac function. However, delineation
of the left ventricle is challenging due to the inherent properties of
ultrasound imaging, such as the presence of speckle noise and the low
signal-to-noise ratio. Methods: We propose a semi-automated segmentation
algorithm for the delineation of the left ventricle in temporal 3D
echocardiography sequences. The method requires minimal user interaction and
relies on a diffeomorphic registration approach. Advantages of the method
include no dependence on prior geometrical information, training data, or
registration from an atlas. Results: The method was evaluated using
three-dimensional ultrasound scan sequences from 18 patients from the
Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, Edmonton, Canada, and compared to manual
delineations provided by an expert cardiologist and four other registration
algorithms. The segmentation approach yielded the following results over the
cardiac cycle: a mean absolute difference of 1.01 (0.21) mm, a Hausdorff
distance of 4.41 (1.43) mm, and a Dice overlap score of 0.93 (0.02).
Conclusions: The method performed well compared to the four other registration
algorithms.]]></summary>

of key importance and relevance to a real-world setting. For question answering
(QA), the current state-of-the-art pre-trained models typically need
fine-tuning on tens of thousands of examples to obtain good results. Their
performance degrades significantly in a few-shot setting (< 100 examples). To
address this, we propose a simple fine-tuning framework that leverages
pre-trained text-to-text models and is directly aligned with their pre-training
framework. Specifically, we construct the input as a concatenation of the
question, a mask token representing the answer span and a context. Given this
input, the model is fine-tuned using the same objective as that of its
pre-training objective. Through experimental studies on various few-shot
configurations, we show that this formulation leads to significant gains on
multiple QA benchmarks (an absolute gain of 34.2 F1 points on average when
there are only 16 training examples). The gains extend further when used with
larger models (Eg:- 72.3 F1 on SQuAD using BART-large with only 32 examples)
and translate well to a multilingual setting . On the multilingual TydiQA
benchmark, our model outperforms the XLM-Roberta-large by an absolute margin of
upto 40 F1 points and an average of 33 F1 points in a few-shot setting (<= 64
training examples). We conduct detailed ablation studies to analyze factors
contributing to these gains.]]></summary>

automotive perception, to trigger a safe fallback mode. NNs often rely on
softmax normalization for confidence estimation, which can lead to high
confidences being assigned to OOD samples, thus hindering the detection of
failures. This paper presents a method for determining whether inputs are OOD,
which does not require OOD data during training and does not increase the

automotive applications with limited computational resources and real-time

pretraining. In the cross-modal setting, tokens in the sentence are masked at
random, and the model predicts the masked tokens given the image and the text.
In this paper, we observe several key disadvantages of MLM in this setting.
First, as captions tend to be short, in a third of the sentences no token is
sampled. Second, the majority of masked tokens are stop-words and punctuation,
leading to under-utilization of the image. We investigate a range of
alternative masking strategies specific to the cross-modal setting that address
these shortcomings, aiming for better fusion of text and image in the learned
representation. When pre-training the LXMERT model, our alternative masking
strategies consistently improve over the original masking strategy on three
downstream tasks, especially in low resource settings. Further, our
pre-training approach substantially outperforms the baseline model on a

a new explainable AI (XAI) framework for explaining decisions made by a deep
convolutional neural network (CNN). In contrast to the current methods in XAI
that generate explanations as a single shot response, we pose explanation as an
iterative communication process, i.e. dialog, between the machine and human
user. More concretely, our CX-ToM framework generates sequence of explanations
in a dialog by mediating the differences between the minds of machine and human
user. To do this, we use Theory of Mind (ToM) which helps us in explicitly
modeling human's intention, machine's mind as inferred by the human as well as
human's mind as inferred by the machine. Moreover, most state-of-the-art XAI
frameworks provide attention (or heat map) based explanations. In our work, we
show that these attention based explanations are not sufficient for increasing
human trust in the underlying CNN model. In CX-ToM, we instead use
counterfactual explanations called fault-lines which we define as follows:
given an input image I for which a CNN classification model M predicts class
c_pred, a fault-line identifies the minimal semantic-level features (e.g.,
stripes on zebra, pointed ears of dog), referred to as explainable concepts,
that need to be added to or deleted from I in order to alter the classification
category of I by M to another specified class c_alt. We argue that, due to the
iterative, conceptual and counterfactual nature of CX-ToM explanations, our
framework is practical and more natural for both expert and non-expert users to
understand the internal workings of complex deep learning models. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments verify our hypotheses, demonstrating
that our CX-ToM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art explainable AI
models.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The primary paradigm for multi-task training in natural language processing
is to represent the input with a shared pre-trained language model, and add a
small, thin network (head) per task. Given an input, a target head is the head
that is selected for outputting the final prediction. In this work, we examine
the behaviour of non-target heads, that is, the output of heads when given
input that belongs to a different task than the one they were trained for. We
find that non-target heads exhibit emergent behaviour, which may either explain
the target task, or generalize beyond their original task. For example, in a
numerical reasoning task, a span extraction head extracts from the input the
arguments to a computation that results in a number generated by a target
generative head. In addition, a summarization head that is trained with a
target question answering head, outputs query-based summaries when given a
question and a context from which the answer is to be extracted. This emergent
behaviour suggests that multi-task training leads to non-trivial extrapolation
of skills, which can be harnessed for interpretability and generalization.]]></summary>

roots/soil or due to increased transpiration. These factors adversely affect
plant physiology and photosynthetic ability to the extent that it has been
shown to have inhibitory effects in both growth and yield [18]. Early
identification of plant water stress status enables suitable corrective
measures to be applied to obtain the expected crop yield. Further, improving
crop yield through precision agriculture methods is a key component of climate
policy and the UN sustainable development goals [1]. Leaf water content (LWC)
is a measure that can be used to estimate water content and identify stressed
plants. LWC during the early crop growth stages is an important indicator of
plant productivity and yield. The effect of water stress can be instantaneous
[15], affecting gaseous exchange or long-term, significantly reducing [9, 18,
22]. It is thus necessary to identify potential plant water stress during the
early stages of growth [15] to introduce corrective irrigation and alleviate
stress. LWC is also useful for identifying plant genotypes that are tolerant to
water stress and salinity by measuring the stability of LWC even under
artificially induced water stress [18, 25]. Such experiments generally employ
destructive procedures to obtain the LWC, which is time-consuming and labor
intensive. Accordingly, this research has developed a non-destructive method to
estimate LWC from UAV-based hyperspectral data.]]></summary>

most critical challenges since the parameter server and the mobile devices
share the training parameters over wireless links. With such consideration, we
adopt the idea of SignSGD in which only the signs of the gradients are
exchanged. Moreover, most of the existing works assume Channel State
Information (CSI) available at both the mobile devices and the parameter
server, and thus the mobile devices can adopt fixed transmission rates dictated
by the channel capacity. In this work, only the parameter server side CSI is
assumed, and channel capacity with outage is considered. In this case, an
essential problem for the mobile devices is to select appropriate local
processing and communication parameters (including the transmission rates) to
achieve a desired balance between the overall learning performance and their
energy consumption. Two optimization problems are formulated and solved, which
optimize the learning performance given the energy consumption requirement, and
vice versa. Furthermore, considering that the data may be distributed across
the mobile devices in a highly uneven fashion in FL, a stochastic sign-based
algorithm is proposed. Extensive simulations are performed to demonstrate the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Targets are essential in problems such as object tracking in cluttered or
textureless environments, camera (and multi-sensor) calibration tasks, and
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Target shapes for these tasks
typically are symmetric (square, rectangular, or circular) and work well for
structured, dense sensor data such as pixel arrays (i.e., image). However,
symmetric shapes lead to pose ambiguity when using sparse sensor data such as
LiDAR point clouds and suffer from the quantization uncertainty of the LiDAR.
This paper introduces the concept of optimizing target shape to remove pose
ambiguity for LiDAR point clouds. A target is designed to induce large
gradients at edge points under rotation and translation relative to the LiDAR
to ameliorate the quantization uncertainty associated with point cloud
sparseness. Moreover, given a target shape, we present a means that leverages
the target's geometry to estimate the target's vertices while globally
estimating the pose. Both the simulation and the experimental results (verified
by a motion capture system) confirm that by using the optimal shape and the
global solver, we achieve centimeter error in translation and a few degrees in
rotation even when a partially illuminated target is placed 30 meters away. All
the implementations and datasets are available at

mixed-integer programming (MIP) problems. Proper selection of cuts would remove
infeasible solutions in the early stage, thus largely reducing the
computational burden without hurting the solution accuracy. However, the major
cut selection approaches heavily rely on heuristics, which strongly depend on
the specific problem at hand and thus limit their generalization capability. In
this paper, we propose a data-driven and generalizable cut selection approach,
named Cut Ranking, in the settings of multiple instance learning. To measure
the quality of the candidate cuts, a scoring function, which takes the
instance-specific cut features as inputs, is trained and applied in cut ranking
and selection. In order to evaluate our method, we conduct extensive
experiments on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets. Compared with
commonly used heuristics for cut selection, the learning-based policy has shown
to be more effective, and is capable of generalizing over multiple problems
with different properties. Cut Ranking has been deployed in an industrial
solver for large-scale MIPs. In the online A/B testing of the product planning
problems with more than $10^7$ variables and constraints daily, Cut Ranking has
achieved the average speedup ratio of 12.42% over the production solver without
any accuracy loss of solution.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spiking neural network (SNN) is interesting both theoretically and
practically because of its strong bio-inspiration nature and potentially
outstanding energy efficiency. Unfortunately, its development has fallen far
behind the conventional deep neural network (DNN), mainly because of difficult
training and lack of widely accepted hardware experiment platforms. In this
paper, we show that a deep temporal-coded SNN can be trained easily and
directly over the benchmark datasets CIFAR10 and ImageNet, with testing
accuracy within 1% of the DNN of equivalent size and architecture. Training
becomes similar to DNN thanks to the closed-form solution to the spiking
waveform dynamics. Considering that SNNs should be implemented in practical
neuromorphic hardwares, we train the deep SNN with weights quantized to 8, 4, 2
bits and with weights perturbed by random noise to demonstrate its robustness
in practical applications. In addition, we develop a phase-domain signal
processing circuit schematic to implement our spiking neuron with 90% gain of
energy efficiency over existing work. This paper demonstrates that the
temporal-coded deep SNN is feasible for applications with high performance and
high energy efficient.]]></summary>

logs via a model-based approach. A forward model of the world supervises a
driving policy that predicts the outcome of any potential driving trajectory.
To support learning from pre-recorded logs, we assume that the world is on
rails, meaning neither the agent nor its actions influence the environment.
This assumption greatly simplifies the learning problem, factorizing the
dynamics into a nonreactive world model and a low-dimensional and compact
forward model of the ego-vehicle. Our approach computes action-values for each
training trajectory using a tabular dynamic-programming evaluation of the
Bellman equations; these action-values in turn supervise the final vision-based
driving policy. Despite the world-on-rails assumption, the final driving policy
acts well in a dynamic and reactive world. At the time of writing, our method
ranks first on the CARLA leaderboard, attaining a 25% higher driving score
while using 40 times less data. Our method is also an order of magnitude more

to recognizing that they may be wrong about their predictions, they perform
poorly. For example, for one of the most common activation functions, the ReLU
and its variants, even a well-calibrated model can produce incorrect but high
confidence predictions. In the related task of action recognition, most current
classification methods are based on clip-level classifiers that densely sample
a given video for non-overlapping, same-sized clips and aggregate the results
using an aggregation function - typically averaging - to achieve video level
predictions. While this approach has shown to be effective, it is sub-optimal
in recognition accuracy and has a high computational overhead. To mitigate both
these issues, we propose the confidence distillation framework to teach a
representation of uncertainty of the teacher to the student sampler and divide
the task of full video prediction between the student and the teacher models.
We conduct extensive experiments on three action recognition datasets and
demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements in action
recognition accuracy (up to 20%) and computational efficiency (more than 40%).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Instance-level image retrieval is the task of searching in a large database
for images that match an object in a query image. To address this task, systems
usually rely on a retrieval step that uses global image descriptors, and a
subsequent step that performs domain-specific refinements or reranking by
leveraging operations such as geometric verification based on local features.
In this work, we propose Reranking Transformers (RRTs) as a general model to
incorporate both local and global features to rerank the matching images in a
supervised fashion and thus replace the relatively expensive process of
geometric verification. RRTs are lightweight and can be easily parallelized so
that reranking a set of top matching results can be performed in a single
forward-pass. We perform extensive experiments on the Revisited Oxford and
Paris datasets, and the Google Landmarks v2 dataset, showing that RRTs
outperform previous reranking approaches while using much fewer local
descriptors. Moreover, we demonstrate that, unlike existing approaches, RRTs
can be optimized jointly with the feature extractor, which can lead to feature
representations tailored to downstream tasks and further accuracy improvements.

environments to ensure safety without being overly cautious. Prior work
explored occlusion inference from observed social behaviors of road agents.
Inferring occupancy from agent behaviors is an inherently multimodal problem; a
driver may behave in the same manner for different occupancy patterns ahead of
them (e.g., a driver may move at constant speed in traffic or on an open road).
Past work, however, does not account for this multimodality, thus neglecting to
model this source of aleatoric uncertainty in the relationship between driver
behaviors and their environment. We propose an occlusion inference method that
characterizes observed behaviors of human agents as sensor measurements, and
fuses them with those from a standard sensor suite. To capture the aleatoric
uncertainty, we train a conditional variational autoencoder with a discrete
latent space to learn a multimodal mapping from observed driver trajectories to
an occupancy grid representation of the view ahead of the driver. Our method
handles multi-agent scenarios, combining measurements from multiple observed
drivers using evidential theory to solve the sensor fusion problem. Our
approach is validated on a real-world dataset, outperforming baselines and
demonstrating real-time capable performance. Our code is available at

combine non-invasive image analysis and machine learning, have been
successfully applied to identify and quantify plant health and diseases.
However, these techniques usually do not consider the progressive nature of
plant stress and often require images showing severe signs of stress to ensure
high confidence detection, thereby reducing the feasibility for early detection
and recovery of plants under stress. To overcome the problem mentioned above,
we propose a deep learning pipeline for the temporal analysis of the visual
changes induced in the plant due to stress and apply it to the specific water
stress identification case in Chickpea plant shoot images. For this, we have
considered an image dataset of two chickpea varieties JG-62 and Pusa-372, under
three water stress conditions; control, young seedling, and before flowering,
captured over five months. We have employed a variant of Convolutional Neural
Network - Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) network to learn spatio-temporal
patterns from the chickpea plant dataset and use them for water stress
classification. Our model has achieved ceiling level classification performance
of 98.52% on JG-62 and 97.78% on Pusa-372 chickpea plant data and has
outperformed the best reported time-invariant technique by at least 14% for
both JG-62 and Pusa-372 species, to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, our
CNN-LSTM model has demonstrated robustness to noisy input, with a less than
2.5% dip in average model accuracy and a small standard deviation about the
mean for both species. Lastly, we have performed an ablation study to analyze
the performance of the CNN-LSTM model by decreasing the number of temporal

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We propose CX-ToM, short for counterfactual explanations with theory-of mind,
a new explainable AI (XAI) framework for explaining decisions made by a deep
convolutional neural network (CNN). In contrast to the current methods in XAI
that generate explanations as a single shot response, we pose explanation as an
iterative communication process, i.e. dialog, between the machine and human
user. More concretely, our CX-ToM framework generates sequence of explanations
in a dialog by mediating the differences between the minds of machine and human
user. To do this, we use Theory of Mind (ToM) which helps us in explicitly
modeling human's intention, machine's mind as inferred by the human as well as
human's mind as inferred by the machine. Moreover, most state-of-the-art XAI
frameworks provide attention (or heat map) based explanations. In our work, we
show that these attention based explanations are not sufficient for increasing
human trust in the underlying CNN model. In CX-ToM, we instead use
counterfactual explanations called fault-lines which we define as follows:
given an input image I for which a CNN classification model M predicts class
c_pred, a fault-line identifies the minimal semantic-level features (e.g.,
stripes on zebra, pointed ears of dog), referred to as explainable concepts,
that need to be added to or deleted from I in order to alter the classification
category of I by M to another specified class c_alt. We argue that, due to the
iterative, conceptual and counterfactual nature of CX-ToM explanations, our
framework is practical and more natural for both expert and non-expert users to
understand the internal workings of complex deep learning models. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments verify our hypotheses, demonstrating
that our CX-ToM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art explainable AI
models.]]></summary>

interaction with global context representations. In this way, Fastformer can
achieve effective context modeling with linear complexity. Extensive
experiments on five datasets show that Fastformer is much more efficient than
many existing Transformer models and can meanwhile achieve comparable or even
better long text modeling performance.]]></summary>

and large-scale image retrieval systems. By fully exploiting label annotations,
they are achieving outstanding retrieval performances compared to the
conventional methods. However, it is painstaking to assign labels precisely for
a vast amount of training data, and also, the annotation process is
error-prone. To tackle these issues, we propose the first deep unsupervised
image retrieval method dubbed Self-supervised Product Quantization (SPQ)
network, which is label-free and trained in a self-supervised manner. We design
a Cross Quantized Contrastive learning strategy that jointly learns codewords
and deep visual descriptors by comparing individually transformed images
(views). Our method analyzes the image contents to extract descriptive
features, allowing us to understand image representations for accurate
retrieval. By conducting extensive experiments on benchmarks, we demonstrate
that the proposed method yields state-of-the-art results even without

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Convolution neural networks have been successful in solving many socially
important and economically significant problems. Their ability to learn complex
high-dimensional functions hierarchically can be attributed to the use of
nonlinear activation functions. A key discovery that made training deep
networks feasible was the adoption of the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
activation function to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem caused by using
saturating activation functions. Since then many improved variants of the ReLU
activation have been proposed. However a majority of activation functions used
today are non-oscillatory and monotonically increasing due to their biological
plausibility. This paper demonstrates that oscillatory activation functions can
improve gradient flow and reduce network size. It is shown that oscillatory
activation functions allow neurons to switch classification (sign of output)
within the interior of neuronal hyperplane positive and negative half-spaces
allowing complex decisions with fewer neurons. A new oscillatory activation
function C(z) = z cos z that outperforms Sigmoids, Swish, Mish and ReLU on a
variety of architectures and benchmarks is presented. This new activation
function allows even single neurons to exhibit nonlinear decision boundaries.
This paper presents a single neuron solution to the famous XOR problem.
Experimental results indicate that replacing the activation function in the
convolutional layers with C(z) significantly improves performance on CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100 and Imagenette.]]></summary>

(OPF) problems in electric power distribution systems. However, the use of

Specifically, we propose imitation learning based improvements in deep

proposed imitation learning algorithm uses the approximate optimal solutions
obtained from a linearized model-based OPF solver to provide a good initial

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-variate time series (MTS) data is a ubiquitous class of data
abstraction in the real world. Any instance of MTS is generated from a hybrid
dynamical system and their specific dynamics are usually unknown. The hybrid
nature of such a dynamical system is a result of complex external attributes,
such as geographic location and time of day, each of which can be categorized
into either spatial attributes or temporal attributes. Therefore, there are two
fundamental views which can be used to analyze MTS data, namely the spatial
view and the temporal view. Moreover, from each of these two views, we can
partition the set of data samples of MTS into disjoint forecasting tasks in
accordance with their associated attribute values. Then, samples of the same
task will manifest similar forthcoming pattern, which is less sophisticated to
be predicted in comparison with the original single-view setting. Considering
this insight, we propose a novel multi-view multi-task (MVMT) learning
framework for MTS forecasting. Instead of being explicitly presented in most
scenarios, MVMT information is deeply concealed in the MTS data, which severely
hinders the model from capturing it naturally. To this end, we develop two
kinds of basic operations, namely task-wise affine transformation and task-wise
normalization, respectively. Applying these two operations with prior knowledge
on the spatial and temporal view allows the model to adaptively extract MVMT
information while predicting. Extensive experiments on three datasets are
conducted to illustrate that canonical architectures can be greatly enhanced by
the MVMT learning framework in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. In
addition, we design rich case studies to reveal the properties of
representations produced at different phases in the entire prediction
procedure.]]></summary>

many researchers study the topic under a Q-Bot-A-Bot image-guessing game
setting, where the Questioner needs to raise a series of questions to collect
information of an undisclosed image. Despite progress has been made in
Supervised Learning (SL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), issues still exist.
Firstly, previous methods do not provide explicit and effective guidance for
Questioner to generate visually related and informative questions. Secondly,
the effect of RL is hampered by an incompetent component, i.e., the Guesser,
who makes image predictions based on the generated dialogs and assigns rewards
accordingly. To enhance VD Questioner: 1) we propose a Related entity enhanced
Questioner (ReeQ) that generates questions under the guidance of related
entities and learns entity-based questioning strategy from human dialogs; 2) we
propose an Augmented Guesser (AugG) that is strong and is optimized for the VD
setting especially. Experimental results on the VisDial v1.0 dataset show that
our approach achieves state-of-theart performance on both image-guessing task
and question diversity. Human study further proves that our model generates
more visually related, informative and coherent questions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Network quantization, which aims to reduce the bit-lengths of the network
weights and activations, has emerged for their deployments to resource-limited
devices. Although recent studies have successfully discretized a full-precision
network, they still incur large quantization errors after training, thus giving
rise to a significant performance gap between a full-precision network and its
quantized counterpart. In this work, we propose a novel quantization method for
neural networks, Cluster-Promoting Quantization (CPQ) that finds the optimal
quantization grids while naturally encouraging the underlying full-precision
weights to gather around those quantization grids cohesively during training.
This property of CPQ is thanks to our two main ingredients that enable
differentiable quantization: i) the use of the categorical distribution
designed by a specific probabilistic parametrization in the forward pass and
ii) our proposed multi-class straight-through estimator (STE) in the backward
pass. Since our second component, multi-class STE, is intrinsically biased, we
additionally propose a new bit-drop technique, DropBits, that revises the
standard dropout regularization to randomly drop bits instead of neurons. As a
natural extension of DropBits, we further introduce the way of learning
heterogeneous quantization levels to find proper bit-length for each layer by
imposing an additional regularization on DropBits. We experimentally validate
our method on various benchmark datasets and network architectures, and also
support a new hypothesis for quantization: learning heterogeneous quantization
levels outperforms the case using the same but fixed quantization levels from
scratch.]]></summary>

raised concerns for fairness implications, especially for racial minorities.
These concerns have generated considerable interest among machine learning and
artificial intelligence researchers, who have developed new methods and
established theoretical bounds for improving fairness, focusing on the source
data, regularization and model training, or post-hoc adjustments to model
scores. However, little work has studied the practical trade-offs between
fairness and accuracy in real-world settings to understand how these bounds and
methods translate into policy choices and impact on society. Our empirical
study fills this gap by investigating the impact of mitigating disparities on
accuracy, focusing on the common context of using machine learning to inform
benefit allocation in resource-constrained programs across education, mental
health, criminal justice, and housing safety. Here we describe applied work in
which we find fairness-accuracy trade-offs to be negligible in practice. In
each setting studied, explicitly focusing on achieving equity and using our
proposed post-hoc disparity mitigation methods, fairness was substantially
improved without sacrificing accuracy. This observation was robust across
policy contexts studied, scale of resources available for intervention, time,
and relative size of the protected groups. These empirical results challenge a
commonly held assumption that reducing disparities either requires accepting an
appreciable drop in accuracy or the development of novel, complex methods,
making reducing disparities in these applications more practical.]]></summary>

divergence between two distributions have been proposed and applied in
large-scale machine learning models. While they have been found to be unstable,
the theoretical root cause of the problem is not clear. In this paper, we study
a generative adversarial network based approach that uses a neural network
discriminator to estimate KL divergence. We argue that, in such case, high
fluctuations in the estimates are a consequence of not controlling the
complexity of the discriminator function space. We provide a theoretical
underpinning and remedy for this problem by first constructing a discriminator
in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). This enables us to leverage
sample complexity and mean embedding to theoretically relate the error
probability bound of the KL estimates to the complexity of the discriminator in
RKHS. Based on this theory, we then present a scalable way to control the
complexity of the discriminator for a reliable estimation of KL divergence. We

linguistics rely on unary modalities to allow for the controlled application of
structural rules affecting word order and phrase structure. These controlled
structural operations give rise to derivational ambiguities that are missed by
the original Lambek Calculus or its pregroup simplification. Proposals for
compositional interpretation of extended Lambek Calculus in the compact closed
category of FVect and linear maps have been made, but in these proposals the
syntax-semantics mapping ignores the control modalities, effectively
restricting their role to the syntax. Our aim is to turn the modalities into
first-class citizens of the vectorial interpretation. Building on the
directional density matrix semantics, we extend the interpretation of the type
system with an extra spin density matrix space. The interpretation of proofs
then results in ambiguous derivations being tensored with orthogonal spin
states. Our method introduces a way of simultaneously representing co-existing
interpretations of ambiguous utterances, and provides a uniform framework for
the integration of lexical and derivational ambiguity.]]></summary>

probabilities, we predict the label. Our refinement process corresponds to
recent findings of the adversarial subspace properties. We extensively evaluate
our approach on 16 adversarial attack benchmarks using ResNet-50,

learning to classify images from an online stream of data and tasks, where
tasks may include new classes (class incremental) or data nonstationarity
(domain incremental). One of the key challenges of continual learning is to
avoid catastrophic forgetting (CF), i.e., forgetting old tasks in the presence
of more recent tasks. Over the past few years, many methods and tricks have
been introduced to address this problem, but many have not been fairly and
systematically compared under a variety of realistic and practical settings. To
better understand the relative advantages of various approaches and the
settings where they work best, this survey aims to (1) compare state-of-the-art
methods such as MIR, iCARL, and GDumb and determine which works best at
different experimental settings; (2) determine if the best class incremental
methods are also competitive in domain incremental setting; (3) evaluate the
performance of 7 simple but effective trick such as "review" trick and nearest
class mean (NCM) classifier to assess their relative impact. Regarding (1), we
observe iCaRL remains competitive when the memory buffer is small; GDumb
outperforms many recently proposed methods in medium-size datasets and MIR
performs the best in larger-scale datasets. For (2), we note that GDumb
performs quite poorly while MIR -- already competitive for (1) -- is also
strongly competitive in this very different but important setting. Overall,
this allows us to conclude that MIR is overall a strong and versatile method
across a wide variety of settings. For (3), we find that all 7 tricks are
beneficial, and when augmented with the "review" trick and NCM classifier, MIR
produces performance levels that bring online continual learning much closer to
its ultimate goal of matching offline training.]]></summary>

thousands of exoplanets and the possibility of the existence of billions of
them in our Galaxy. The biggest goal in these searches is whether there are
other life-harbouring planets. However, the question which of these detected
planets are habitable, potentially-habitable, or maybe even inhabited, is still
not answered. Some potentially habitable exoplanets have been hypothesized, but
since Earth is the only known habitable planet, measures of habitability are
necessarily determined with Earth as the reference. Several recent works
introduced new habitability metrics based on optimization methods.
Classification of potentially habitable exoplanets using supervised learning is
another emerging area of study. However, both modeling and supervised learning
approaches suffer from drawbacks. We propose an anomaly detection method, the
Multi-Stage Memetic Algorithm (MSMA), to detect anomalies and extend it to an
unsupervised clustering algorithm MSMVMCA to use it to detect potentially
habitable exoplanets as anomalies. The algorithm is based on the postulate that
Earth is an anomaly, with the possibility of existence of few other anomalies
among thousands of data points. We describe an MSMA-based clustering approach
with a novel distance function to detect habitable candidates as anomalies
(including Earth). The results are cross-matched with the habitable exoplanet
catalog (PHL-HEC) of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory (PHL) with both

image to resist potential noises while ensuring the embedded image has few
perceptual perturbations from the original one. Recently, with the tremendous
successes gained by deep neural networks in various fields, the researches of
data hiding with deep learning models have attracted an increasing number of
attentions. In the data hiding task, each pixel of cover images should be
treated differently since they have divergent tolerabilities. The neglect of
considering the sensitivity of each pixel will inevitably affect the model
robustness for information hiding. Targeting this problem, we propose a novel
deep data hiding scheme with Inverse Gradient Attention (IGA), combing the
ideas of adversarial learning and attention mechanism to endow different
sensitivities for different pixels. With the proposed component, the model can
spotlight pixels with more robustness for data hiding. Empirically, extensive
experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods on two prevalent datasets under multiple evaluations. Besides, we
further identify and discuss the connections between the proposed inverse

cameras are bio-inspired cameras that work by mimicking the working of the
human eye. These cameras have multiple advantages over conventional frame-based

power consumption, etc. However, these advantages come at a high cost, as
event-based cameras are noise sensitive and have low resolution. Moreover, the
task of moving object detection in these cameras is difficult, as event-based
sensors capture only the binary changes in brightness of a scene, lacking
useful visual features like texture and color. In this paper, we investigate
the application of the k-means clustering technique in detecting moving objects
in event-based data. Experimental results in publicly available datasets using
k-means show significant improvement in performance over the state-of-the-art

led to significant performance gains on a wide range of cross-lingual NLP
tasks, success on many downstream tasks still relies on the availability of
sufficient annotated data. Traditional fine-tuning of pre-trained models using
only a few target samples can cause over-fitting. This can be quite limiting as
most languages in the world are under-resourced. In this work, we investigate
cross-lingual adaptation using a simple nearest neighbor few-shot (<15 samples)
inference technique for classification tasks. We experiment using a total of 16
distinct languages across two NLP tasks- XNLI and PAWS-X. Our approach
consistently improves traditional fine-tuning using only a handful of labeled
samples in target locales. We also demonstrate its generalization capability
across tasks.]]></summary>

long-tail problem, mainly in object classification tasks. In this paper, we
make the first large-scale study concerning the task of Long-Tail Visual
Relationship Recognition (LTVRR). LTVRR aims at improving the learning of
structured visual relationships that come from the long-tail (e.g., "rabbit
grazing on grass"). In this setup, the subject, relation, and object classes
each follow a long-tail distribution. To begin our study and make a future
benchmark for the community, we introduce two LTVRR-related benchmarks, dubbed
VG8K-LT and GQA-LT, built upon the widely used Visual Genome and GQA datasets.
We use these benchmarks to study the performance of several state-of-the-art
long-tail models on the LTVRR setup. Lastly, we propose a visiolinguistic
hubless (VilHub) loss and a Mixup augmentation technique adapted to LTVRR
setup, dubbed as RelMix. Both VilHub and RelMix can be easily integrated on top
of existing models and despite being simple, our results show that they can
remarkably improve the performance, especially on tail classes. Benchmarks,

the heterogeneous and imbalanced data make the model converge inconsistently
over different corpora in real world. One common practice is to adjust the
share of each corpus in the training, so that the learning process is balanced
and low-resource cases can benefit from the high resource ones. However,
automatic balancing methods usually depend on the intra- and inter-dataset
characteristics, which is usually agnostic or requires human priors. In this
work, we propose an approach, MultiUAT, that dynamically adjusts the training
data usage based on the model's uncertainty on a small set of trusted clean
data for multi-corpus machine translation. We experiments with two classes of
uncertainty measures on multilingual (16 languages with 4 settings) and
multi-domain settings (4 for in-domain and 2 for out-of-domain on
English-German translation) and demonstrate our approach MultiUAT substantially
outperforms its baselines, including both static and dynamic strategies. We
analyze the cross-domain transfer and show the deficiency of static and
similarity based methods.]]></summary>

propose an autoencoder, TearingNet, which tackles the challenging task of
representing the point clouds using a fixed-length descriptor. Unlike existing
works directly deforming predefined primitives of genus zero (e.g., a 2D square
patch) to an object-level point cloud, our TearingNet is characterized by a
proposed Tearing network module and a Folding network module interacting with
each other iteratively. Particularly, the Tearing network module learns the
point cloud topology explicitly. By breaking the edges of a primitive graph, it
tears the graph into patches or with holes to emulate the topology of a target
point cloud, leading to faithful reconstructions. Experimentation shows the
superiority of our proposal in terms of reconstructing point clouds as well as
generating more topology-friendly representations than benchmarks.]]></summary>

to the new reality, where people may wear surgical masks to cover their noses
and mouths. Traditional data sets (e.g., CelebA, CASIA-WebFace) used for

unsuited due to the lack of examples of people wearing masks. We propose a
method for enhancing data sets containing faces without masks by creating
synthetic masks and overlaying them on faces in the original images. Our method
relies on Spark AR Studio, a developer program made by Facebook that is used to
create Instagram face filters. In our approach, we use 9 masks of different
colors, shapes and fabrics. We employ our method to generate a number of
445,446 (90%) samples of masks for the CASIA-WebFace data set and 196,254
(96.8%) masks for the CelebA data set, releasing the mask images at
https://github.com/securifai/masked_faces. We show that our method produces
significantly more realistic training examples of masks overlaid on faces by
asking volunteers to qualitatively compare it to other methods or data sets
designed for the same task. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our method by
evaluating state-of-the-art face recognition systems (FaceNet, VGG-face,
ArcFace) trained on the enhanced data sets and showing that they outperform
equivalent systems trained on the original data sets (containing faces without

an off-the-shelf object detector to identify and localize object instances,
match labels of detected regions to concepts parsed from captions, and thus
create "pseudo" labels for learning scene graph. Further, we design a
Transformer-based model to predict these "pseudo" labels via a masked token
prediction task. Learning from only image-sentence pairs, our model achieves
30% relative gain over a latest method trained with human-annotated unlocalized

filter bank convolutional neural network (FBCNN) -- to improve SSVEP
classification in single-channel BCIs with small data lengths.

Methods: We propose two models: the FBCNN-2D and the FBCNN-3D. The FBCNN-2D
utilizes a filter bank to create sub-band components of the
electroencephalography (EEG) signal, which it transforms using the fast Fourier
transform (FFT) and analyzes with a 2D CNN. The FBCNN-3D utilizes the same
filter bank, but it transforms the sub-band components into spectrograms via
short-time Fourier transform (STFT), and analyzes them with a 3D CNN. We made
use of transfer learning. To train the FBCNN-3D, we proposed a new technique,
called inter-dimensional transfer learning, to transfer knowledge from a 2D DNN
to a 3D DNN. Our BCI was conceived so as not to require calibration from the
final user: therefore, the test subject data was separated from training and
validation.

Results: The mean test accuracy was 85.7% for the FBCCA-2D and 85% for the
FBCCA-3D. Mean F1-Scores were 0.858 and 0.853. Alternative classification
methods, SVM, FBCCA and a CNN, had mean accuracy of 79.2%, 80.1% and 81.4%,
respectively.

Conclusion: The FBCNNs surpassed traditional SSVEP classification methods in
our simulated BCI, by a considerable margin (about 5% higher accuracy).
Transfer learning and inter-dimensional transfer learning made training much
faster and more predictable.

Significance: We proposed a new and flexible type of DNN, which had a better
performance than standard methods in SSVEP classification for portable and fast
BCIs.]]></summary>

customer service domain, agents could use dialogue summaries to help boost
their works by quickly knowing customer's issues and service progress. These
applications require summaries to contain the perspective of a single speaker

datasets. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel Chinese dataset for
Customer Service Dialogue Summarization (CSDS). CSDS improves the abstractive
summaries in two aspects: (1) In addition to the overall summary for the whole
dialogue, role-oriented summaries are also provided to acquire different
speakers' viewpoints. (2) All the summaries sum up each topic separately, thus
containing the topic-level structure of the dialogue. We define tasks in CSDS
as generating the overall summary and different role-oriented summaries for a
given dialogue. Next, we compare various summarization methods on CSDS, and
experiment results show that existing methods are prone to generate redundant
and incoherent summaries. Besides, the performance becomes much worse when
analyzing the performance on role-oriented summaries and topic structures. We
hope that this study could benchmark Chinese dialogue summarization and benefit
further studies.]]></summary>

defense methods against various adversarial attacks. To our knowledge, existing
AT-based methods usually train with the locally most adversarial perturbed
points and treat all the perturbed points equally, which may lead to
considerably weaker adversarial robust generalization on test data. In this
work, we introduce a new adversarial training framework that considers the
diversity as well as characteristics of the perturbed points in the vicinity of
benign samples. To realize the framework, we propose a Regional Adversarial
Training (RAT) defense method that first utilizes the attack path generated by
the typical iterative attack method of projected gradient descent (PGD), and
constructs an adversarial region based on the attack path. Then, RAT samples
diverse perturbed training points efficiently inside this region, and utilizes
a distance-aware label smoothing mechanism to capture our intuition that
perturbed points at different locations should have different impact on the
model performance. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show
that RAT consistently makes significant improvement on standard adversarial
training (SAT), and exhibits better robust generalization.]]></summary>

concerns in recent years. Following the success of deep learning, existing
methods always formulate DeepFake video detection as a binary classification
problem and develop frame-based and video-based solutions. However, little

forged videos. To address this issue, we term this task as a Spatial-Temporal
Inconsistency Learning (STIL) process and instantiate it into a novel STIL
block, which consists of a Spatial Inconsistency Module (SIM), a Temporal
Inconsistency Module (TIM), and an Information Supplement Module (ISM).
Specifically, we present a novel temporal modeling paradigm in TIM by
exploiting the temporal difference over adjacent frames along with both
horizontal and vertical directions. And the ISM simultaneously utilizes the
spatial information from SIM and temporal information from TIM to establish a
more comprehensive spatial-temporal representation. Moreover, our STIL block is
flexible and could be plugged into existing 2D CNNs. Extensive experiments and

plays a critical role in numerous applications of geometric data from low-level
processing to high-level analysis. To further advance the research in this
field, we provide the first timely and comprehensive overview of GSP
methodologies for geometric data in a unified manner by bridging the
connections between geometric data and graphs, among the various geometric data
modalities, and with spectral/nodal graph filtering techniques. We also discuss
the recently developed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and interpret the operation
of these networks from the perspective of GSP. We conclude with a brief
discussion of open problems and challenges.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning hierarchical structures in sequential data -- from simple
algorithmic patterns to natural language -- in a reliable, generalizable way
remains a challenging problem for neural language models. Past work has shown
that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) struggle to generalize on held-out
algorithmic or syntactic patterns without supervision or some inductive bias.
To remedy this, many papers have explored augmenting RNNs with various
differentiable stacks, by analogy with finite automata and pushdown automata.
In this paper, we present a stack RNN model based on the recently proposed
Nondeterministic Stack RNN (NS-RNN) that achieves lower cross-entropy than all
previous stack RNNs on five context-free language modeling tasks (within 0.05
nats of the information-theoretic lower bound), including a task in which the
NS-RNN previously failed to outperform a deterministic stack RNN baseline. Our
model assigns arbitrary positive weights instead of probabilities to stack
actions, and we provide an analysis of why this improves training. We also
propose a restricted version of the NS-RNN that makes it practical to use for
language modeling on natural language and present results on the Penn Treebank
corpus.]]></summary>

contrastive learning to impose relation-related structure on the token-level

Additional visualization by a tSNE analysis shows the effectiveness of the

we can learn a different space for named entity recognition, again using a
contrastive learning objective, and demonstrate how to successfully combine
both representation spaces in an entity-relation task.]]></summary>

researches focus on text-only dialogue tasks. In this paper, we propose a new
task named as \textbf{M}eme incorporated \textbf{O}pen-domain \textbf{D}ialogue

conversations with $\sim$606K utterances. Each conversation contains about $13$
utterances with about $4$ Internet memes on average and each utterance equipped
with an Internet meme is annotated with the corresponding emotion. In addition,
we present a simple and effective method, which utilizes a unified generation

tasks, by simply reading textual instructions that define them and looking at a
few examples. NLP models built with the conventional paradigm, however, often
struggle with generalization across tasks (e.g., a question-answering system
cannot solve classification tasks). A long-standing challenge in AI is to build
a model that is equipped with the understanding of human-readable instructions
that define the tasks, and can generalize to new tasks. To study this, we
introduce NATURAL INSTRUCTIONS, a dataset of 61 distinct tasks, their
human-authored instructions and 193k task instances. The instructions are
obtained from crowdsourcing instructions used to collect existing NLP datasets
and mapped to a unified schema. We adopt generative pre-trained language models
to encode task-specific instructions along with input and generate task output.
Our results indicate that models can benefit from instructions to generalize
across tasks. These models, however, are far behind supervised task-specific
models, indicating significant room for more progress in this direction.]]></summary>

applications. However, it is difficult to tell beforehand if a DNN receiving an
input will deliver the correct output since their decision criteria are usually
nontransparent. A DNN delivers the correct output if the input is within the
area enclosed by its generalization envelope. In this case, the information
contained in the input sample is processed reasonably by the network. It is of
large practical importance to assess at inference time if a DNN generalizes
correctly. Currently, the approaches to achieve this goal are investigated in
different problem set-ups rather independently from one another, leading to
three main research and literature fields: predictive uncertainty,
out-of-distribution detection and adversarial example detection. This survey
connects the three fields within the larger framework of investigating the
generalization performance of machine learning methods and in particular DNNs.
We underline the common ground, point at the most promising approaches and give
a structured overview of the methods that provide at inference time means to

existing attacks are often assessed using different SR models, recognition
tasks and datasets, and only few adversarial defenses borrowed from computer
vision are considered. Yet,these defenses have not been thoroughly evaluated
against adaptive attacks. Thus, there is still a lack of quantitative
understanding about the strengths and limitations of adversarial attacks and
defenses. More effective defenses are also required for securing SR systems. To
bridge this gap, we present SEC4SR, the first platform enabling researchers to
systematically and comprehensively evaluate adversarial attacks and defenses in
SR. SEC4SR incorporates 4 white-box and 2 black-box attacks, 24 defenses
including our novel feature-level transformations. It also contains techniques
for mounting adaptive attacks. Using SEC4SR, we conduct thus far the
largest-scale empirical study on adversarial attacks and defenses in SR,
involving 23 defenses, 15 attacks and 4 attack settings. Our study provides
lots of useful findings that may advance future research: such as (1) all the
transformations slightly degrade accuracy on benign examples and their
effectiveness vary with attacks; (2) most transformations become less effective
under adaptive attacks, but some transformations become more effective; (3) few
transformations combined with adversarial training yield stronger defenses over
some but not all attacks, while our feature-level transformation combined with
adversarial training yields the strongest defense over all the attacks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate capabilities and advantages of SEC4SR which
can benefit future research in SR.]]></summary>

diversity of AI and non-AI modules with huge code sizes and long and
complicated execution paths, which raises serious benchmarking or evaluating
challenges. Using AI components or micro benchmarks alone can lead to
error-prone conclusions. This paper presents a methodology to attack the above
challenge. We formalize a real-world application scenario as a Directed Acyclic
Graph-based model and propose the rules to distill it into a permutation of
essential AI and non-AI tasks, which we call a scenario benchmark. Together
with seventeen industry partners, we extract nine typical scenario benchmarks.
We design and implement an extensible, configurable, and flexible benchmark
framework. We implement two Internet service AI scenario benchmarks based on
the framework as proxies to two real-world application scenarios. We consider
scenario, component, and micro benchmarks as three indispensable parts for
evaluating. Our evaluation shows the advantage of our methodology against using
component or micro AI benchmarks alone. The specifications, source code,

occurrence of a future accident from dashcam videos, which is vital for a
safety-guaranteed self-driving system. To encourage an early and accurate
decision, existing approaches typically focus on capturing the cues of spatial
and temporal context before a future accident occurs. However, their
decision-making lacks visual explanation and ignores the dynamic interaction
with the environment. In this paper, we propose Deep ReInforced accident
anticipation with Visual Explanation, named DRIVE. The method simulates both
the bottom-up and top-down visual attention mechanism in a dashcam observation
environment so that the decision from the proposed stochastic multi-task agent
can be visually explained by attentive regions. Moreover, the proposed dense
anticipation reward and sparse fixation reward are effective in training the
DRIVE model with our improved reinforcement learning algorithm. Experimental
results show that the DRIVE model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
multiple real-world traffic accident datasets. Code and pre-trained model are

dynamical systems in recent years. Modern dynamical systems are becoming
increasingly non-linear and complex, and there is a need for a framework to
model these systems in a compact and comprehensive representation for
prediction and control. The central problem in applying Koopman theory to a
system of interest is that the choice of finite-dimensional basis functions is
typically done apriori, using expert knowledge of the systems dynamics. Our
approach learns these basis functions using a supervised learning approach
where a combination of autoencoders and deep neural networks learn the basis
functions for any given system. We demonstrate this approach on a simple
pendulum example in which we obtain a linear representation of the non-linear
system and then predict the future state trajectories given some initial
conditions. We also explore how changing the input representation of the
dynamic systems time series data can impact the quality of learned basis
functions. This alternative representation is compared to the traditional raw
time series data approach to determine which method results in lower
reconstruction and prediction error of the true non-linear dynamics of the
system.]]></summary>

multiple views of a shared context. Recent works intuitively apply contrastive
learning (CL) to learn representations, regarded as a pairwise manner, which is
still scalable: view-specific noise is not filtered in learning view-shared
representations; the fake negative pairs, where the negative terms are actually
within the same class as the positive, and the real negative pairs are
coequally treated; and evenly measuring the similarities between terms might
interfere with optimization. Importantly, few works research the theoretical
framework of generalized self-supervised multi-view learning, especially for
more than two views. To this end, we rethink the existing multi-view learning
paradigm from the information theoretical perspective and then propose a novel
information theoretical framework for generalized multi-view learning. Guided
by it, we build a multi-view coding method with a three-tier progressive
architecture, namely Information theory-guided heuristic Progressive Multi-view
Coding (IPMC). In the distribution-tier, IPMC aligns the distribution between
views to reduce view-specific noise. In the set-tier, IPMC builds self-adjusted
pools for contrasting, which utilizes a view filter to adaptively modify the
pools. Lastly, in the instance-tier, we adopt a designed unified loss to learn
discriminative representations and reduce the gradient interference.
Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate the superiority of IPMC over
state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

to exploit auditory information to aid the visual models, however, the
performance is limited due to the lack of an effective approach for feature

network to address the critical challenges in crowd counting by effectively
utilizing both visual and audio inputs for better modalities association and
productive feature extraction. The proposed network introduces the notion of
auxiliary and explicit image patch-importance ranking (PIR) and patch-wise
crowd estimate (PCE) information to produce a third (run-time) modality. These
modalities (audio, visual, run-time) undergo a transformer-inspired
cross-modality co-attention mechanism to finally output the crowd estimate. To
acquire rich visual features, we propose a multi-branch structure with
transformer-style fusion in-between. Extensive experimental evaluations show
that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art networks under all
evaluation settings with up to 33.8% improvement. We also analyze and compare
the vision-only variant of our network and empirically demonstrate its

We present Cascaded Primitive Fitting Networks (CPFN) that relies on an

formulation that dynamically aggregates the primitives across global and local

developing deeper and more complex networks, which significantly increased
network complexity. In this paper, two effective novel blocks are developed:
analysis and synthesis block that employs the convolution layer and Generalized
Divisive Normalization (GDN) in the variable-rate encoder and decoder side. Our
network utilizes a pixel RNN approach for quantization. Furthermore, to improve
the whole network, we encode a residual image using LSTM cells to reduce
unnecessary information. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed
variable-rate framework with novel blocks outperforms existing methods and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hyperspectral images (HSI) consist of rich spatial and spectral information,
which can potentially be used for several applications. However, noise, band
correlations and high dimensionality restrict the applicability of such data.
This is recently addressed using creative deep learning network architectures
such as ResNet, SSRN, and A2S2K. However, the last layer, i.e the
classification layer, remains unchanged and is taken to be the softmax
classifier. In this article, we propose to use a watershed classifier.
Watershed classifier extends the watershed operator from Mathematical
Morphology for classification. In its vanilla form, the watershed classifier
does not have any trainable parameters. In this article, we propose a novel
approach to train deep learning networks to obtain representations suitable for
the watershed classifier. The watershed classifier exploits the connectivity
patterns, a characteristic of HSI datasets, for better inference. We show that
exploiting such characteristics allows the Triplet-Watershed to achieve
state-of-art results in supervised and semi-supervised contexts. These results
are validated on Indianpines (IP), University of Pavia (UP), Kennedy Space
Center (KSC) and University of Houston (UH) datasets, relying on simple convnet
architecture using a quarter of parameters compared to previous
state-of-the-art networks. The source code for reproducing the experiments and
supplementary material (high resolution images) is available at

as it enables them to properly perceive the surrounding environment and to
carry out targeted operations. The most recent methods make use of
state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to learn a valid model for the
target task. However, those techniques need a large amount of labeled data for
training. A recent approach to deal with this issue is data augmentation
through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), where entire synthetic scenes
are added to the training data, thus enlarging and diversifying their
informative content. In this work, we propose an alternative solution with
respect to the common data augmentation methods, applying it to the fundamental
problem of crop/weed segmentation in precision farming. Starting from real
images, we create semi-artificial samples by replacing the most relevant object
classes (i.e., crop and weeds) with their synthesized counterparts. To do that,
we employ a conditional GAN (cGAN), where the generative model is trained by
conditioning the shape of the generated object. Moreover, in addition to RGB
data, we take into account also near-infrared (NIR) information, generating
four channel multi-spectral synthetic images. Quantitative experiments, carried
out on three publicly available datasets, show that (i) our model is capable of
generating realistic multi-spectral images of plants and (ii) the usage of such
synthetic images in the training process improves the segmentation performance
of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation convolutional networks.]]></summary>

applications in computer vision and robotics for solving non-convex
optimization problems involving rotations? In studying the empirical
performance we note that there are few failure cases reported in the
literature, in particular for estimation problems with a single rotation,
motivating us to gain further theoretical understanding.

A general framework based on tools from algebraic geometry is introduced for
analyzing the power of semidefinite relaxations of problems with quadratic
objective functions and rotational constraints. Applications include
registration, hand-eye calibration and rotation averaging. We characterize the
extreme points, and show that there exist failure cases for which the
relaxation is not tight, even in the case of a single rotation. We also show
that some problem classes are always tight given an appropriate
parametrization. Our theoretical findings are accompanied with numerical

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has become a popular framework for learning
implicit 3D representations and addressing different tasks such as novel-view
synthesis or depth-map estimation. However, in downstream applications where
decisions need to be made based on automatic predictions, it is critical to
leverage the confidence associated with the model estimations. Whereas
uncertainty quantification is a long-standing problem in Machine Learning, it
has been largely overlooked in the recent NeRF literature. In this context, we
propose Stochastic Neural Radiance Fields (S-NeRF), a generalization of
standard NeRF that learns a probability distribution over all the possible
radiance fields modeling the scene. This distribution allows to quantify the
uncertainty associated with the scene information provided by the model. S-NeRF
optimization is posed as a Bayesian learning problem which is efficiently
addressed using the Variational Inference framework. Exhaustive experiments
over benchmark datasets demonstrate that S-NeRF is able to provide more
reliable predictions and confidence values than generic approaches previously
proposed for uncertainty estimation in other domains.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this manuscript, we introduce a semi-automatic scene graph annotation tool
for images, the GeneAnnotator. This software allows human annotators to
describe the existing relationships between participators in the visual scene
in the form of directed graphs, hence enabling the learning and reasoning on
visual relationships, e.g., image captioning, VQA and scene graph generation,
etc. The annotations for certain image datasets could either be merged in a
single VG150 data-format file to support most existing models for scene graph
learning or transformed into a separated annotation file for each single image
to build customized datasets. Moreover, GeneAnnotator provides a rule-based
relationship recommending algorithm to reduce the heavy annotation workload.
With GeneAnnotator, we propose Traffic Genome, a comprehensive scene graph
dataset with 1000 diverse traffic images, which in return validates the
effectiveness of the proposed software for scene graph annotation. The project

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Online continual learning for image classification studies the problem of
learning to classify images from an online stream of data and tasks, where
tasks may include new classes (class incremental) or data nonstationarity
(domain incremental). One of the key challenges of continual learning is to
avoid catastrophic forgetting (CF), i.e., forgetting old tasks in the presence
of more recent tasks. Over the past few years, many methods and tricks have
been introduced to address this problem, but many have not been fairly and
systematically compared under a variety of realistic and practical settings. To
better understand the relative advantages of various approaches and the
settings where they work best, this survey aims to (1) compare state-of-the-art
methods such as MIR, iCARL, and GDumb and determine which works best at
different experimental settings; (2) determine if the best class incremental
methods are also competitive in domain incremental setting; (3) evaluate the
performance of 7 simple but effective trick such as "review" trick and nearest
class mean (NCM) classifier to assess their relative impact. Regarding (1), we
observe iCaRL remains competitive when the memory buffer is small; GDumb
outperforms many recently proposed methods in medium-size datasets and MIR
performs the best in larger-scale datasets. For (2), we note that GDumb
performs quite poorly while MIR -- already competitive for (1) -- is also
strongly competitive in this very different but important setting. Overall,
this allows us to conclude that MIR is overall a strong and versatile method
across a wide variety of settings. For (3), we find that all 7 tricks are
beneficial, and when augmented with the "review" trick and NCM classifier, MIR
produces performance levels that bring online continual learning much closer to
its ultimate goal of matching offline training.]]></summary>

vasculatures from fundus images help identify early signs of many crucial
illnesses such as diabetic retinopathy. Due to the varying shape, size, and
patterns of retinal vessels, along with artefacts and noises in fundus images,
no one-stage method can accurately segment retinal vessels. In this work, we
propose a multi-scale, multi-level attention embedded CNN architecture
((M)SLAe-Net) to address the issue of multi-stage processing for robust and
precise segmentation of retinal vessels. We do this by extracting features at
multiple scales and multiple levels of the network, enabling our model to
holistically extracts the local and global features. Multi-scale features are
extracted using our novel dynamic dilated pyramid pooling (D-DPP) module. We
also aggregate the features from all the network levels. These effectively
resolved the issues of varying shapes and artefacts and hence the need for
multiple stages. To assist in better pixel-level classification, we use the
Squeeze and Attention(SA) module, a smartly adapted version of the Squeeze and
Excitation(SE) module for segmentation tasks in our network to facilitate
pixel-group attention. Our unique network design and novel D-DPP module with
efficient task-specific loss function for thin vessels enabled our model for
better cross data performance. Exhaustive experimental results on DRIVE, STARE,

of key importance and relevance to a real-world setting. For question answering
(QA), the current state-of-the-art pre-trained models typically need
fine-tuning on tens of thousands of examples to obtain good results. Their
performance degrades significantly in a few-shot setting (< 100 examples). To
address this, we propose a simple fine-tuning framework that leverages
pre-trained text-to-text models and is directly aligned with their pre-training
framework. Specifically, we construct the input as a concatenation of the
question, a mask token representing the answer span and a context. Given this
input, the model is fine-tuned using the same objective as that of its
pre-training objective. Through experimental studies on various few-shot
configurations, we show that this formulation leads to significant gains on
multiple QA benchmarks (an absolute gain of 34.2 F1 points on average when
there are only 16 training examples). The gains extend further when used with
larger models (Eg:- 72.3 F1 on SQuAD using BART-large with only 32 examples)
and translate well to a multilingual setting . On the multilingual TydiQA
benchmark, our model outperforms the XLM-Roberta-large by an absolute margin of
upto 40 F1 points and an average of 33 F1 points in a few-shot setting (<= 64

Faster R-CNN, and CenterNet. Out of all the object detectors tested, the YOLO
yields the highest accuracy levels of up to 96% (AP10) and frame rates of up to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we investigate the problem of facial kinship verification by
learning hierarchical reasoning graph networks. Conventional methods usually
focus on learning discriminative features for each facial image of a paired
sample and neglect how to fuse the obtained two facial image features and
reason about the relations between them. To address this, we propose a
Star-shaped Reasoning Graph Network (S-RGN). Our S-RGN first constructs a
star-shaped graph where each surrounding node encodes the information of
comparisons in a feature dimension and the central node is employed as the
bridge for the interaction of surrounding nodes. Then we perform relational
reasoning on this star graph with iterative message passing. The proposed S-RGN
uses only one central node to analyze and process information from all
surrounding nodes, which limits its reasoning capacity. We further develop a
Hierarchical Reasoning Graph Network (H-RGN) to exploit more powerful and
flexible capacity. More specifically, our H-RGN introduces a set of latent
reasoning nodes and constructs a hierarchical graph with them. Then bottom-up
comparative information abstraction and top-down comprehensive signal
propagation are iteratively performed on the hierarchical graph to update the
node features. Extensive experimental results on four widely used kinship
databases show that the proposed methods achieve very competitive results.]]></summary>

visual information in the unseen environments. Previous works usually implement
deep models to train an agent to predict actions in real-time. However, in the
unseen environment, when the target object is not in egocentric view, the agent
may not be able to make wise decisions due to the lack of guidance. In this
paper, we propose a hierarchical object-to-zone (HOZ) graph to guide the agent
in a coarse-to-fine manner, and an online-learning mechanism is also proposed
to update HOZ according to the real-time observation in new environments. In
particular, the HOZ graph is composed of scene nodes, zone nodes and object
nodes. With the pre-learned HOZ graph, the real-time observation and the target
goal, the agent can constantly plan an optimal path from zone to zone. In the
estimated path, the next potential zone is regarded as sub-goal, which is also
fed into the deep reinforcement learning model for action prediction. Our
methods are evaluated on the AI2-Thor simulator. In addition to widely used
evaluation metrics SR and SPL, we also propose a new evaluation metric of SAE
that focuses on the effective action rate. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.]]></summary>

or 3-D coronary angiography require prior information, e.g., the phase during a
cardiac cycle with least motion, called resting phase (RP). The purpose of this
work is to propose a fully automated framework that allows the detection of the
right coronary artery (RCA) RP within CINE series. Methods: The proposed
prototype system consists of three main steps. First, the localization of the
regions of interest (ROI) is performed. Second, as CINE series are
time-resolved, the cropped ROI series over all time points are taken for
tracking motions quantitatively. Third, the output motion values are used to
classify RPs. In this work, we focused on the detection of the area with the
outer edge of the cross-section of the RCA as our target. The proposed
framework was evaluated on 102 clinically acquired dataset at 1.5T and 3T. The
automatically classified RPs were compared with the ground truth RPs annotated
manually by a medical expert for testing the robustness and feasibility of the
framework. Results: The predicted RCA RPs showed high agreement with the
experts annotated RPs with 92.7% accuracy, 90.5% sensitivity and 95.0%
specificity for the unseen study dataset. The mean absolute difference of the
start and end RP was 13.6 ${\pm}$ 18.6 ms for the validation study dataset
(n=102). Conclusion: In this work, automated RP detection has been introduced
by the proposed framework and demonstrated feasibility, robustness, and
applicability for diverse static imaging acquisitions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Model compression techniques are recently gaining explosive attention for
obtaining efficient AI models for various real-time applications. Channel
pruning is one important compression strategy and is widely used in slimming
various DNNs. Previous gate-based or importance-based pruning methods aim to
remove channels whose importance is smallest. However, it remains unclear what
criteria the channel importance should be measured on, leading to various
channel selection heuristics. Some other sampling-based pruning methods deploy
sampling strategies to train sub-nets, which often causes the training
instability and the compressed model's degraded performance. In view of the
research gaps, we present a new module named Gates with Differentiable
Polarization (GDP), inspired by principled optimization ideas. GDP can be
plugged before convolutional layers without bells and whistles, to control the
on-and-off of each channel or whole layer block. During the training process,
the polarization effect will drive a subset of gates to smoothly decrease to
exact zero, while other gates gradually stay away from zero by a large margin.
When training terminates, those zero-gated channels can be painlessly removed,
while other non-zero gates can be absorbed into the succeeding convolution
kernel, causing completely no interruption to training nor damage to the
trained model. Experiments conducted over CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets show
that the proposed GDP algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance on
various benchmark DNNs at a broad range of pruning ratios. We also apply GDP to
DeepLabV3Plus-ResNet50 on the challenging Pascal VOC segmentation task, whose
test performance sees no drop (even slightly improved) with over 60% FLOPs
saving.]]></summary>

algorithmic framework for separable optimization problems with linear
constraints. For numerical ADMM fail to exploit the particular structure of the
problem at hand nor the input data information, leveraging task-specific
modules (e.g., neural networks and other data-driven architectures) to extend
ADMM is a significant but challenging task. This work focuses on designing a
flexible algorithmic framework to incorporate various task-specific modules
(with no additional constraints) to improve the performance of ADMM in
real-world applications. Specifically, we propose Guidance from Optimality
(GO), a new customization strategy, to embed task-specific modules into ADMM
(GO-ADMM). By introducing an optimality-based criterion to guide the
propagation, GO-ADMM establishes an updating scheme agnostic to the choice of
additional modules. The existing task-specific methods just plug their
task-specific modules into the numerical iterations in a straightforward
manner. Even with some restrictive constraints on the plug-in modules, they can
only obtain some relatively weaker convergence properties for the resulted ADMM
iterations. Fortunately, without any restrictions on the embedded modules, we
prove the convergence of GO-ADMM regarding objective values and constraint
violations, and derive the worst-case convergence rate measured by iteration
complexity. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical
results and demonstrate the efficiency of GO-ADMM.]]></summary>

Recent studies propose supervised PQ, where the embedding and quantization
models can be jointly trained with supervised learning. However, there is a
lack of appropriate formulation of the joint training objective; thus, the
improvements over previous non-supervised baselines are limited in reality. In
this work, we propose the Matching-oriented Product Quantization (MoPQ), where
a novel objective Multinoulli Contrastive Loss (MCL) is formulated. With the
minimization of MCL, we are able to maximize the matching probability of query
and ground-truth key, which contributes to the optimal retrieval accuracy.
Given that the exact computation of MCL is intractable due to the demand of
vast contrastive samples, we further propose the Differentiable Cross-device
Sampling (DCS), which significantly augments the contrastive samples for
precise approximation of MCL. We conduct extensive experimental studies on four
real-world datasets, whose results verify the effectiveness of MoPQ.]]></summary>

landscape animation as it determines how objects move in videos. Existing

generation, which leads to unrealistic video results. To tackle this problem,
we propose a model named FGLA to generate high-quality and realistic videos by

consists of two parts: (1) a motion encoder which embeds time-lapse motion in a
fine-grained way. (2) a motion generator which generates realistic motion to
animate input images. To train and evaluate on diverse time-lapse videos, we
build the largest high-resolution Time-lapse video dataset with Diverse scenes,
namely Time-lapse-D, which includes 16,874 video clips with over 10 million

dividends expectation, and share price. It often involves multiple
tensor-compatible datasets with non-linear multi-way relationships,
spatiotemporal structures, and different levels of sparsity. Current non-linear
tensor completion algorithms tend to learn noisy embedding and incur
overfitting. This paper focuses on the embedding learning aspect of the tensor
completion problem and proposes a new multi-layer neural network architecture
for tensor factorization and completion (MLCTR). The network architecture
entails multiple advantages: a series of low-rank matrix factorizations (MF)
building blocks to minimize overfitting, interleaved transfer functions in each
layer for non-linearity, and by-pass connections to reduce the gradient
diminishing problem and increase the depths of neural networks. Furthermore,
the model employs Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) based optimization for fast
convergence in training. Our algorithm is highly efficient for imputing missing
values in the EPS data. Experiments confirm that our strategy of incorporating
non-linearity in factor matrices demonstrates impressive performance in
embedding learning and end-to-end tensor models, and outperforms approaches
with non-linearity in the phase of reconstructing tensors from factor matrices.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rapid emergence of high-dimensional data in various areas has brought new
challenges to current ensemble clustering research. To deal with the curse of
dimensionality, recently considerable efforts in ensemble clustering have been
made by means of different subspace-based techniques. However, besides the
emphasis on subspaces, rather limited attention has been paid to the potential
diversity in similarity/dissimilarity metrics. It remains a surprisingly open
problem in ensemble clustering how to create and aggregate a large population
of diversified metrics, and furthermore, how to jointly investigate the
multi-level diversity in the large populations of metrics, subspaces, and
clusters in a unified framework. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a
novel multidiversified ensemble clustering approach. In particular, we create a
large number of diversified metrics by randomizing a scaled exponential
similarity kernel, which are then coupled with random subspaces to form a large
set of metric-subspace pairs. Based on the similarity matrices derived from
these metric-subspace pairs, an ensemble of diversified base clusterings can
thereby be constructed. Further, an entropy-based criterion is utilized to
explore the cluster-wise diversity in ensembles, based on which three specific
ensemble clustering algorithms are presented by incorporating three types of
consensus functions. Extensive experiments are conducted on 30 high-dimensional
datasets, including 18 cancer gene expression datasets and 12 image/speech
datasets, which demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms over the
state-of-the-art. The source code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the Domain Generalization (DG) problem where the hypotheses are composed
of a common representation function followed by a labeling function, we point
out a shortcoming in existing approaches that fail to explicitly optimize for a
term, appearing in a well-known and widely adopted upper bound to the risk on
the unseen domain, that is dependent on the representation to be learned. To
this end, we first derive a novel upper bound to the prediction risk. We show
that imposing a mild assumption on the representation to be learned, namely
manifold restricted invertibility, is sufficient to deal with this issue.
Further, unlike existing approaches, our novel upper bound doesn't require the
assumption of Lipschitzness of the loss function. In addition, the
distributional discrepancy in the representation space is handled via the
Wasserstein-2 barycenter cost. In this context, we creatively leverage old and
recent transport inequalities, which link various optimal transport metrics, in
particular the $L^1$ distance (also known as the total variation distance) and
the Wasserstein-2 distances, with the Kullback-Liebler divergence. These
analyses and insights motivate a new representation learning cost for DG that
additively balances three competing objectives: 1) minimizing classification
error across seen domains via cross-entropy, 2) enforcing domain-invariance in
the representation space via the Wasserstein-2 barycenter cost, and 3)
promoting non-degenerate, nearly-invertible representation via one of two
mechanisms, viz., an autoencoder-based reconstruction loss or a mutual
information loss. It is to be noted that the proposed algorithms completely
bypass the use of any adversarial training mechanism that is typical of many
current domain generalization approaches. Simulation results on several
standard datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to several
well-known DG algorithms.]]></summary>

suitable for real-time odometry applications. The square root formulation
pervades three major aspects of our optimization-based sliding-window
estimator: for bundle adjustment we eliminate landmark variables with nullspace
projection; to store the marginalization prior we employ a matrix square root
of the Hessian; and when marginalizing old poses we avoid forming normal
equations and update the square root prior directly with a specialized QR
decomposition. We show that the proposed square root marginalization is
algebraically equivalent to the conventional use of Schur complement (SC) on
the Hessian. Moreover, it elegantly deals with rank-deficient Jacobians
producing a prior equivalent to SC with Moore-Penrose inverse. Our evaluation
of visual and visual-inertial odometry on real-world datasets demonstrates that
the proposed estimator is 36% faster than the baseline. It furthermore shows
that in single precision, conventional Hessian-based marginalization leads to
numeric failures and reduced accuracy. We analyse numeric properties of the
marginalization prior to explain why our square root form does not suffer from
the same effect and therefore entails superior performance.]]></summary>

between pairs of columns of a table. Generally, RE models for this task require
labelled tables for training. These labelled tables can also be generated
artificially from a Knowledge Graph (KG), which makes the cost to acquire them
much lower in comparison to manual annotations. However, unlike real tables,
these synthetic tables lack associated metadata, such as, column-headers,
captions, etc; this is because synthetic tables are created out of KGs that do
not store such metadata. Meanwhile, previous works have shown that metadata is
important for accurate RE from tables. To address this issue, we propose
methods to artificially create some of this metadata for synthetic tables.
Afterward, we experiment with a BERT-based model, in line with recently
published works, that takes as input a combination of proposed artificial
metadata and table content. Our empirical results show that this leads to an
improvement of 9\%-45\% in F1 score, in absolute terms, over 2 tabular

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Visual emotion analysis (VEA) has attracted great attention recently, due to
the increasing tendency of expressing and understanding emotions through images
on social networks. Different from traditional vision tasks, VEA is inherently
more challenging since it involves a much higher level of complexity and
ambiguity in human cognitive process. Most of the existing methods adopt deep
learning techniques to extract general features from the whole image,
disregarding the specific features evoked by various emotional stimuli.
Inspired by the \textit{Stimuli-Organism-Response (S-O-R)} emotion model in
psychological theory, we proposed a stimuli-aware VEA method consisting of
three stages, namely stimuli selection (S), feature extraction (O) and emotion
prediction (R). First, specific emotional stimuli (i.e., color, object, face)
are selected from images by employing the off-the-shelf tools. To the best of
our knowledge, it is the first time to introduce stimuli selection process into
VEA in an end-to-end network. Then, we design three specific networks, i.e.,
Global-Net, Semantic-Net and Expression-Net, to extract distinct emotional
features from different stimuli simultaneously. Finally, benefiting from the
inherent structure of Mikel's wheel, we design a novel hierarchical
cross-entropy loss to distinguish hard false examples from easy ones in an
emotion-specific manner. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on four public visual
emotion datasets. Ablation study and visualizations further prove the validity
and interpretability of our method.]]></summary>

would achieve Out-of-Distribution (OoD) Generalization, i.e. reliably make

to generalize well when facing a shift in distribution. Several methods were
thereby designed to improve the robustness of the features learned by a model
through Regularization- or Domain-Prediction-based schemes. Segmenting medical
images such as MRIs of the hippocampus is essential for the diagnosis and
treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. But these brain images often suffer
from distribution shift due to the patient's age and various pathologies
affecting the shape of the organ. In this work, we evaluate OoD Generalization
solutions for the problem of hippocampus segmentation in MR data using both

build three pre-trained language models across three variants of Arabic: Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), dialectal Arabic, and classical Arabic, in addition to a
fourth language model which is pre-trained on a mix of the three. We also
examine the importance of pre-training data size by building additional models
that are pre-trained on a scaled-down set of the MSA variant. We compare our
different models to each other, as well as to eight publicly available models
by fine-tuning them on five NLP tasks spanning 12 datasets. Our results suggest
that the variant proximity of pre-training data to fine-tuning data is more
important than the pre-training data size. We exploit this insight in defining
an optimized system selection model for the studied tasks.]]></summary>

dramatically slow down the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. We
present a novel fever-screening system, F3S, that uses edge machine learning
techniques to accurately measure core body temperatures of multiple individuals
in a free-flow setting. F3S performs real-time sensor fusion of visual camera
with thermal camera data streams to detect elevated body temperature, and it
has several unique features: (a) visual and thermal streams represent very
different modalities, and we dynamically associate semantically-equivalent
regions across visual and thermal frames by using a new, dynamic alignment
technique that analyzes content and context in real-time, (b) we track people
through occlusions, identify the eye (inner canthus), forehead, face and head
regions where possible, and provide an accurate temperature reading by using a
prioritized refinement algorithm, and (c) we robustly detect elevated body
temperature even in the presence of personal protective equipment like masks,
or sunglasses or hats, all of which can be affected by hot weather and lead to
spurious temperature readings. F3S has been deployed at over a dozen large

and output asynchronous event streams with high dynamic range and less motion
blur. It has been shown that events alone can be used for end-task learning,
\eg, semantic segmentation, based on encoder-decoder-like networks. However, as
events are sparse and mostly reflect edge information, it is difficult to
recover original details merely relying on the decoder. Moreover, most methods
resort to pixel-wise loss alone for supervision, which might be insufficient to
fully exploit the visual details from sparse events, thus leading to less
optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet flexible two-stream
framework named Dual Transfer Learning (DTL) to effectively enhance the
performance on the end-tasks without adding extra inference cost. The proposed
approach consists of three parts: event to end-task learning (EEL) branch,
event to image translation (EIT) branch, and transfer learning (TL) module that
simultaneously explores the feature-level affinity information and pixel-level
knowledge from the EIT branch to improve the EEL branch. This simple yet novel
method leads to strong representation learning from events and is evidenced by
the significant performance boost on the end-tasks such as semantic
segmentation and depth estimation.]]></summary>

diagnosis. Although previous attempts to classify sleep stages have achieved
high classification performance, several challenges remain open: 1) How to
effectively utilize time-varying spatial and temporal features from
multi-channel brain signals remains challenging. Prior works have not been able
to fully utilize the spatial topological information among brain regions. 2)
Due to the many differences found in individual biological signals, how to
overcome the differences of subjects and improve the generalization of deep
neural networks is important. 3) Most deep learning methods ignore the
interpretability of the model to the brain. To address the above challenges, we
propose a multi-view spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks (MSTGCN)
with domain generalization for sleep stage classification. Specifically, we
construct two brain view graphs for MSTGCN based on the functional connectivity
and physical distance proximity of the brain regions. The MSTGCN consists of
graph convolutions for extracting spatial features and temporal convolutions
for capturing the transition rules among sleep stages. In addition, attention
mechanism is employed for capturing the most relevant spatial-temporal
information for sleep stage classification. Finally, domain generalization and
MSTGCN are integrated into a unified framework to extract subject-invariant
sleep features. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that the
proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.]]></summary>

including augmented reality (AR). However, this requires not only real-time
speed and accurate hand pose and shape but also plausible mesh-image alignment.
While existing works already achieve promising results, meeting all three
requirements is very challenging. This paper presents a novel pipeline by
decoupling the hand-mesh reconstruction task into three stages: a joint stage
to predict hand joints and segmentation; a mesh stage to predict a rough hand
mesh; and a refine stage to fine-tune it with an offset mesh for mesh-image
alignment. With careful design in the network structure and in the loss
functions, we can promote high-quality finger-level mesh-image alignment and
drive the models together to deliver real-time predictions. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
quality of our results outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on
hand-mesh/pose precision and hand-image alignment. In the end, we also showcase
several real-time AR scenarios.]]></summary>

observe that representations learned by discriminative models are more prone to

as neuron networks (NNs), latent semantic analysis (LSA), naive-Bayes
classifiers (NBC), and a pattern recognition model using regular expression
(REGEX). A corpus of 7,873 scientific articles dealing with natural products

automatically extracts categorical and numerical parameters such as (i) the
plant species from which active molecules are extracted, (ii) the
microorganisms species for which active molecules can act against, and (iii)
the values of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against these
microorganisms. The parameters are extracted without part-of-speech tagging
(POS) and named entity recognition (NER) approaches (i.e. without the need of
text annotation), and the models training is performed with unsupervised
approaches. In this way, a.RIX can be essentially used on articles from any

used to calculate the log-likelihood of researcher-written trigger phrases

decrease in performance on standard language modeling benchmarks compared to
unfiltered baselines. We provide a partial explanation for this performance gap
by surfacing examples of hate speech and other undesirable content from

interesting moments according to a user's preference, which has recently raised
the community's attention. Current methods regard the user's history as
holistic information to predict the user's preference but negating the inherent
diversity of the user's interests, resulting in vague preference
representation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient preference
reasoning framework (PR-Net) to explicitly take the diverse interests into
account for frame-level highlight prediction. Specifically, distinct
user-specific preferences for each input query frame are produced, presented as
the similarity weighted sum of history highlights to the corresponding query
frame. Next, distinct comprehensive preferences are formed by the user-specific
preferences and a learnable generic preference for more overall highlight
measurement. Lastly, the degree of highlight and non-highlight for each query
frame is calculated as semantic similarity to its comprehensive and
non-highlight preferences, respectively. Besides, to alleviate the ambiguity
due to the incomplete annotation, a new bi-directional contrastive loss is
proposed to ensure a compact and differentiable metric space. In this way, our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a relative
improvement of 12% in mean accuracy precision.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Medical dialogue systems (MDSs) aim to assist doctors and patients with a
range of professional medical services, i.e., diagnosis, consultation, and
treatment. However, one-stop MDS is still unexplored because: (1) no dataset
has so large-scale dialogues contains both multiple medical services and
fine-grained medical labels (i.e., intents, slots, values); (2) no model has
addressed a MDS based on multiple-service conversations in a unified framework.
In this work, we first build a Multiple-domain Multiple-service medical
dialogue (M^2-MedDialog)dataset, which contains 1,557 conversations between
doctors and patients, covering 276 types of diseases, 2,468 medical entities,
and 3 specialties of medical services. To the best of our knowledge, it is the
only medical dialogue dataset that includes both multiple medical services and
fine-grained medical labels. Then, we formulate a one-stop MDS as a
sequence-to-sequence generation problem. We unify a MDS with causal language
modeling and conditional causal language modeling, respectively. Specifically,
we employ several pretrained models (i.e., BERT-WWM, BERT-MED, GPT2, and MT5)
and their variants to get benchmarks on M^2-MedDialog dataset. We also propose
pseudo labeling and natural perturbation methods to expand M2-MedDialog dataset
and enhance the state-of-the-art pretrained models. We demonstrate the results
achieved by the benchmarks so far through extensive experiments on
M2-MedDialog. We release the dataset, the code, as well as the evaluation
scripts to facilitate future research in this important research direction.]]></summary>

employ recommender systems in their online businesses, e.g., personalized
purchase prediction of shopping baskets. While most previous techniques have
focused on leveraging a user's history, the study of combining it with others'
histories remains untapped potential. This paper proposes Global-Local Item
Embedding (GLOIE) that learns to utilize the temporal properties of sets across
whole users as well as within a user by coining the names as global and local
information to distinguish the two temporal patterns. GLOIE uses Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) and dynamic graph-based model to capture global and local
information and then applies attention to integrate resulting item embeddings.
Additionally, we propose to use Tweedie output for the decoder of VAE as it can
easily model zero-inflated and long-tailed distribution, which is more suitable
for several real-world data distributions than Gaussian or multinomial
counterparts. When evaluated on three public benchmarks, our algorithm
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in most ranking
metrics.]]></summary>

operator parameterizations: graph-based operators, low-rank operators,
multipole graph-based operators, and Fourier operators and describe efficient
algorithms for computing with each one. The proposed neural operators are
resolution-invariant: they share the same network parameters between different
discretizations of the underlying function spaces and can be used for zero-shot
super-resolutions. Numerically, the proposed models show superior performance
compared to existing machine learning based methodologies on Burgers' equation,
Darcy flow, and the Navier-Stokes equation, while being several order of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rapid recent progress in machine learning (ML) has raised a number of
scientific questions that challenge the longstanding dogma of the field. One of
the most important riddles is the good empirical generalization of
overparameterized models. Overparameterized models are excessively complex with
respect to the size of the training dataset, which results in them perfectly
fitting (i.e., interpolating) the training data, which is usually noisy. Such
interpolation of noisy data is traditionally associated with detrimental
overfitting, and yet a wide range of interpolating models -- from simple linear
models to deep neural networks -- have recently been observed to generalize
extremely well on fresh test data. Indeed, the recently discovered double
descent phenomenon has revealed that highly overparameterized models often
improve over the best underparameterized model in test performance.

Understanding learning in this overparameterized regime requires new theory
and foundational empirical studies, even for the simplest case of the linear
model. The underpinnings of this understanding have been laid in very recent
analyses of overparameterized linear regression and related statistical
learning tasks, which resulted in precise analytic characterizations of double
descent. This paper provides a succinct overview of this emerging theory of
overparameterized ML (henceforth abbreviated as TOPML) that explains these
recent findings through a statistical signal processing perspective. We
emphasize the unique aspects that define the TOPML research area as a subfield
of modern ML theory and outline interesting open questions that remain.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is notoriously difficult to control the behavior of reinforcement learning
agents. Agents often learn to exploit the environment or reward signal and need
to be retrained multiple times. The multi-objective reinforcement learning
(MORL) framework separates a reward function into several objectives. An ideal
MORL agent learns to generalize to novel combinations of objectives allowing
for better control of an agent's behavior without requiring retraining. Many
MORL approaches use a weight vector to parameterize the importance of each
objective. However, this approach suffers from lack of expressiveness and
interpretability. We propose using propositional logic to specify the
importance of multiple objectives. By using a logic where predicates correspond
directly to objectives, specifications are inherently more interpretable.
Additionally the set of specifications that can be expressed with formal
languages is a superset of what can be expressed by weight vectors. In this
paper, we define a formal language based on propositional logic with
quantitative semantics. We encode logical specifications using a recurrent
neural network and show that MORL agents parameterized by these encodings are
able to generalize to novel specifications over objectives and achieve
performance comparable to single objective baselines.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning general-purpose representations from multisensor data produced by
the omnipresent sensing systems (or IoT in general) has numerous applications
in diverse use cases. Existing purely supervised end-to-end deep learning
techniques depend on the availability of a massive amount of well-curated data,
acquiring which is notoriously difficult but required to achieve a sufficient
level of generalization on a task of interest. In this work, we leverage the
self-supervised learning paradigm towards realizing the vision of continual
learning from unlabeled inputs. We present a generalized framework named Sense
and Learn for representation or feature learning from raw sensory data. It
consists of several auxiliary tasks that can learn high-level and broadly
useful features entirely from unannotated data without any human involvement in
the tedious labeling process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on
several publicly available datasets from different domains and in various
settings, including linear separability, semi-supervised or few shot learning,
and transfer learning. Our methodology achieves results that are competitive
with the supervised approaches and close the gap through fine-tuning a network
while learning the downstream tasks in most cases. In particular, we show that
the self-supervised network can be utilized as initialization to significantly
boost the performance in a low-data regime with as few as 5 labeled instances
per class, which is of high practical importance to real-world problems.
Likewise, the learned representations with self-supervision are found to be
highly transferable between related datasets, even when few labeled instances
are available from the target domains. The self-learning nature of our
methodology opens up exciting possibilities for on-device continual learning.]]></summary>

image generation and processing, and have recently attracted growing interests
in financial modelings. This paper analyzes GANs from the perspectives of
mean-field games (MFGs) and optimal transport. More specifically, from the game
theoretical perspective, GANs are interpreted as MFGs under Pareto Optimality
criterion or mean-field controls; from the optimal transport perspective, GANs
are to minimize the optimal transport cost indexed by the generator from the
known latent distribution to the unknown true distribution of data. The MFGs
perspective of GANs leads to a GAN-based computational method (MFGANs) to solve
MFGs: one neural network for the backward Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and
one neural network for the forward Fokker-Planck equation, with the two neural
networks trained in an adversarial way. Numerical experiments demonstrate
superior performance of this proposed algorithm, especially in the higher
dimensional case, when compared with existing neural network approaches.]]></summary>

applications, such as market research and situational awareness. We identify
two lines of approaches to the problem of opinion prediction. One uses
topic-based sentiment analysis with time-series modeling, while the other uses
static embedding of text. The latter approaches seek user-specific solutions by
generating user fingerprints. Such approaches are useful in predicting user's
reactions to unseen content. In this work, we propose a novel dynamic
fingerprinting method that leverages contextual embedding of user's comments
conditioned on relevant user's reading history. We integrate BERT variants with
a recurrent neural network to generate predictions. The results show up to 13\%
improvement in micro F1-score compared to previous approaches. Experimental
results show novel insights that were previously unknown such as better
predictions for an increase in dynamic history length, the impact of the nature

In this paper, we create a dataset for constructive and toxic speech detection,
named UIT-ViCTSD (Vietnamese Constructive and Toxic Speech Detection dataset)
with 10,000 human-annotated comments. For these tasks, we propose a system for
constructive and toxic speech detection with the state-of-the-art transfer

F1-scores of 78.59% and 59.40% for classifying constructive and toxic comments,
respectively. Besides, we implement various baseline models as traditional
Machine Learning and Deep Neural Network-Based models to evaluate the dataset.
With the results, we can solve several tasks on the online discussions and
develop the framework for identifying constructiveness and toxicity of

of combinatorial optimization tasks that have natural encodings as Ising
models. However, recent experiments on QA hardware platforms have demonstrated
that, in the operating regime corresponding to weak interactions, the QA
hardware behaves like a noisy Gibbs sampler at a hardware-specific effective
temperature. This work builds on those insights and identifies a class of small
hardware-native Ising models that are robust to noise effects and proposes a
novel procedure for executing these models on QA hardware to maximize Gibbs
sampling performance. Experimental results indicate that the proposed protocol
results in high-quality Gibbs samples from a hardware-specific effective
temperature and that the QA annealing time can be used to adjust the effective
temperature of the output distribution. The procedure proposed in this work
provides a new approach to using QA hardware for Ising model sampling
presenting potential new opportunities for applications in machine learning and

identify named entities from user queries as diverse surface form attribute
values and afterward transform them into formally canonical forms. Such a
problem consists of two phases: {named entity recognition (NER)} and {attribute
value normalization (AVN)}. However, existing works only focus on the NER phase
but neglect equally important AVN. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a
unified query attribute value extraction system in e-commerce search named
QUEACO, which involves both two phases. Moreover, by leveraging large-scale
weakly-labeled behavior data, we further improve the extraction performance
with less supervision cost. Specifically, for the NER phase, QUEACO adopts a
novel teacher-student network, where a teacher network that is trained on the
strongly-labeled data generates pseudo-labels to refine the weakly-labeled data
for training a student network. Meanwhile, the teacher network can be
dynamically adapted by the feedback of the student's performance on
strongly-labeled data to maximally denoise the noisy supervisions from the weak
labels. For the AVN phase, we also leverage the weakly-labeled
query-to-attribute behavior data to normalize surface form attribute values
from queries into canonical forms from products. Extensive experiments on a
real-world large-scale E-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
QUEACO.]]></summary>

by learning separate embeddings. At test time, given a single unposed image of

single image, and then rendered from new viewpoints or their shape and texture
edited by varying the latent codes. We conduct experiments on the SRN

benefit from a deeper understanding and exchange between AI and software

decomposition equipped with manifold learning has become a promising model to
exploit the multi-dimensional structure and extract the feature from tensor
data. However, the existing methods such as graph regularized tensor ring
decomposition (GNTR) only models the pair-wise similarities of objects. For
tensor data with complex manifold structure, the graph can not exactly
construct similarity relationships. In this paper, in order to effectively
utilize the higher-dimensional and complicated similarities among objects, we
introduce hypergraph to the framework of NTR to further enhance the feature
extraction, upon which a hypergraph regularized nonnegative tensor ring
decomposition (HGNTR) method is developed. To reduce the computational
complexity and suppress the noise, we apply the low-rank approximation trick to
accelerate HGNTR (called LraHGNTR). Our experimental results show that compared
with other state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed HGNTR and LraHGNTR can
achieve higher performance in clustering tasks, in addition, LraHGNTR can
greatly reduce running time without decreasing accuracy.]]></summary>

objective is to generate more accurate segmentation results on unlabeled

future research in this area, we collect a large dataset containing various
users' personalized images called PIS (Personalized Image Semantic
Segmentation). We also survey some recent researches related to this problem
and report their performance on our dataset. Furthermore, by observing the
correlation among a user's personalized images, we propose a baseline method
that incorporates the inter-image context when segmenting certain images.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the existing methods on

biomedical document to referent entities in a knowledge base. Recently, many
BERT-based models have been introduced for the task. While these models have
achieved competitive results on many datasets, they are computationally
expensive and contain about 110M parameters. Little is known about the factors
contributing to their impressive performance and whether the
over-parameterization is needed. In this work, we shed some light on the inner
working mechanisms of these large BERT-based models. Through a set of probing
experiments, we have found that the entity linking performance only changes
slightly when the input word order is shuffled or when the attention scope is
limited to a fixed window size. From these observations, we propose an
efficient convolutional neural network with residual connections for biomedical
entity linking. Because of the sparse connectivity and weight sharing
properties, our model has a small number of parameters and is highly efficient.
On five public datasets, our model achieves comparable or even better linking
accuracy than the state-of-the-art BERT-based models while having about 60
times fewer parameters.]]></summary>

applications over large-scale networks. To alleviate the communication burden,
sign-based optimization algorithms have gained popularity recently in both
industrial and academic communities, which is shown to be closely related to
adaptive gradient methods, such as Adam. Along this line, this paper
investigates faster convergence for a variant of sign-based gradient descent,
called scaled signGD, in three cases: 1) the objective function is strongly
convex; 2) the objective function is nonconvex but satisfies the
Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequality; 3) the gradient is stochastic, called
scaled signGD in this case. For the first two cases, it can be shown that the
scaled signGD converges at a linear rate. For case 3), the algorithm is shown
to converge linearly to a neighborhood of the optimal value when a constant
learning rate is employed, and the algorithm converges at a rate of $O(1/k)$
when using a diminishing learning rate, where $k$ is the iteration number. The
results are also extended to the distributed setting by majority vote in a
parameter-server framework. Finally, numerical experiments on logistic
regression are performed to corroborate the theoretical findings.]]></summary>

have gradually become the code-base of building stronger artificial
intelligence(AI). The RL algorithm design firstly needs to adapt to the
specific environment, so the designed environment guides the rapid and profound
development of RL algorithms. However, the existing environments, which can be
divided into real world games and customized toy environments, have obvious
shortcomings. For real world games, it is designed for human entertainment, and
too much difficult for most of RL researchers. For customized toy environments,
there is no widely accepted unified evaluation standard for all RL algorithms.
Therefore, we introduce the first virtual user-friendly environment framework
for RL. In this framework, the environment can be easily configured to realize
all kinds of RL tasks in the mainstream research. Then all the mainstream
state-of-the-art(SOTA) RL algorithms can be conveniently evaluated and
compared. Therefore, our contributions mainly includes the following aspects:
1.single configured environment for all classification of SOTA RL algorithms;
2.combined environment of more than one classification RL algorithms; 3.the
evaluation standard for all kinds of RL algorithms. With all these efforts, a
possibility for breeding an AI with capability of general competency in a

tasks is a widely observed limitation of contemporary neural networks. Although
many continual learning methods are proposed to mitigate this drawback, the
main question remains unanswered: what is the root cause of catastrophic
forgetting? In this work, we aim at answering this question by posing and
validating a set of research hypotheses related to the specificity of
representations built internally by neural models. More specifically, we design
a set of empirical evaluations that compare the robustness of representations
in discriminative and generative models against catastrophic forgetting. We
observe that representations learned by discriminative models are more prone to
catastrophic forgetting than their generative counterparts, which sheds new
light on the advantages of developing generative models for continual learning.
Finally, our work opens new research pathways and possibilities to adopt
generative models in continual learning beyond mere replay mechanisms.]]></summary>

essential in uncovering this coherence and predicting the exact chronological

systems: there is indeed inconsistency between training and testing.
Constructing a high-quality co-saliency detection dataset involves
time-consuming and labor-intensive pixel-level labeling, which has forced most
recent works to rely instead on semantic segmentation or saliency detection
datasets for training. However, the lack of proper co-saliency and the absence
of multiple foreground objects in these datasets can lead to spurious
variations and inherent biases learned by models. To tackle this, we introduce
the idea of counterfactual training through context adjustment, and propose a
"cost-free" group-cut-paste (GCP) procedure to leverage images from
off-the-shelf saliency detection datasets and synthesize new samples. Following
GCP, we collect a novel dataset called Context Adjustment Training (CAT). CAT
consists of 33,500 images, making it four times larger than the current
co-saliency detection datasets. All images are automatically annotated with
high-quality mask annotations, object categories, and edge maps. Extensive
experiments with state-of-the-art models are conducted to demonstrate the
superiority of our dataset. We hope that the scale, diversity, and quality of
our dataset can benefit researchers in this area and beyond. The dataset and

extraction from medical images with a wide array of applications in clinical
practice, such as clinical decision support in oncology. However, noise in low
dose computed tomography (CT) scans can impair the accurate extraction of
radiomic features. In this article, we investigate the possibility of using
deep learning generative models to improve the performance of radiomics from
low dose CTs. We used two datasets of low dose CT scans -NSCLC Radiogenomics
and LIDC-IDRI - as test datasets for two tasks - pre-treatment survival
prediction and lung cancer diagnosis. We used encoder-decoder networks and
conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) trained in a previous study
as generative models to transform low dose CT images into full dose CT images.
Radiomic features extracted from the original and improved CT scans were used
to build two classifiers - a support vector machine (SVM) and a deep attention
based multiple instance learning model - for survival prediction and lung
cancer diagnosis respectively. Finally, we compared the performance of the
models derived from the original and improved CT scans. Encoder-decoder
networks and CGANs improved the area under the curve (AUC) of survival
prediction from 0.52 to 0.57 (p-value<0.01). On the other hand, Encoder-decoder
network and CGAN can improve the AUC of lung cancer diagnosis from 0.84 to 0.88
and 0.89 respectively (p-value<0.01). Moreover, there are no statistically
significant differences in improving AUC by using encoder-decoder network and
CGAN (p-value=0.34) when networks trained at 75 and 100 epochs. Generative
models can improve the performance of low dose CT-based radiomics in different
tasks. Hence, denoising using generative models seems to be a necessary
pre-processing step for calculating radiomic features from low dose CTs.]]></summary>

method providing multiplex molecular and functional information from the rodent

offers excellent soft-tissue contrast and high-resolution brain anatomy.
Nevertheless, registration of multi-modal images remains challenging, chiefly
due to the entirely different image contrast rendered by these modalities.
Previously reported registration algorithms mostly relied on manual
user-dependent brain segmentation, which compromised data interpretation and
accurate quantification. Here we propose a fully automated registration method
for MSOT-MRI multimodal imaging empowered by deep learning. The automated
workflow includes neural network-based image segmentation to generate suitable
masks, which are subsequently registered using an additional neural network.
Performance of the algorithm is showcased with datasets acquired by
cross-sectional MSOT and high-field MRI preclinical scanners. The automated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dynamic imaging is a beneficial tool for interventions to assess
physiological changes. Nonetheless during dynamic MRI, while achieving a high
temporal resolution, the spatial resolution is compromised. To overcome this
spatio-temporal trade-off, this research presents a super-resolution (SR) MRI
reconstruction with prior knowledge based fine-tuning to maximise spatial
information while reducing the required scan-time for dynamic MRIs. An U-Net
based network with perceptual loss is trained on a benchmark dataset and
fine-tuned using one subject-specific static high resolution MRI as prior
knowledge to obtain high resolution dynamic images during the inference stage.
3D dynamic data for three subjects were acquired with different parameters to
test the generalisation capabilities of the network. The method was tested for
different levels of in-plane undersampling for dynamic MRI. The reconstructed
dynamic SR results after fine-tuning showed higher similarity with the high
resolution ground-truth, while quantitatively achieving statistically
significant improvement. The average SSIM of the lowest resolution experimented
during this research (6.25~\% of the k-space) before and after fine-tuning were
0.939 $\pm$ 0.008 and 0.957 $\pm$ 0.006 respectively. This could theoretically
result in an acceleration factor of 16, which can potentially be acquired in
less than half a second. The proposed approach shows that the super-resolution
MRI reconstruction with prior-information can alleviate the spatio-temporal
trade-off in dynamic MRI, even for high acceleration factors.]]></summary>

models trained on a certain source domain and hope to directly apply the most
appropriate ones to different target domains based on the models' relative
performance. Ideally we should annotate a validation set for model performance
assessment on each new target environment, but such annotations are often very
expensive. Under this circumstance, we introduce the problem of ranking models
in unlabeled new environments. For this problem, we propose to adopt a proxy
dataset that 1) is fully labeled and 2) well reflects the true model rankings
in a given target environment, and use the performance rankings on the proxy
sets as surrogates. We first select labeled datasets as the proxy.
Specifically, datasets that are more similar to the unlabeled target domain are
found to better preserve the relative performance rankings. Motivated by this,
we further propose to search the proxy set by sampling images from various
datasets that have similar distributions as the target. We analyze the problem
and its solutions on the person re-identification (re-ID) task, for which
sufficient datasets are publicly available, and show that a carefully
constructed proxy set effectively captures relative performance ranking in new
environments. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/sxzrt/Proxy-Set}.]]></summary>

problems, such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech

taking model complexity into account. However, designing of the search space
suitable for specific hardware is still a challenging task. To address this
problem we propose a measure of hardware efficiency of neural architecture
search space - matrix efficiency measure (MEM); a search space comprising of
hardware-efficient operations; a latency-aware scaling method; and ISyNet - a
set of architectures designed to be fast on the specialized neural processing

designed architectures for the NPU devices on ImageNet and the generalization

our daily lives, but also in the medical and rehabilitation fields. The
development of deep learning has also contributed to the advancement of human
activity recognition, but the large amount of data annotation work required to
train deep learning models is a major obstacle to the development of human
activity recognition. Contrastive learning has started to be used in the field
of sensor-based human activity recognition due to its ability to avoid the cost
of labeling large datasets and its ability to better distinguish between sample
representations of different instances. Among them, data augmentation, an
important part of contrast learning, has a significant impact on model
effectiveness, but current data augmentation methods do not perform too
successfully in contrast learning frameworks for wearable sensor-based activity
recognition. To optimize the effect of contrast learning models, in this paper,
we investigate the sampling frequency of sensors and propose a resampling data
augmentation method. In addition, we also propose a contrast learning framework
based on human activity recognition and apply the resampling augmentation
method to the data augmentation phase of contrast learning. The experimental
results show that the resampling augmentation method outperforms supervised
learning by 9.88% on UCI HAR and 7.69% on Motion Sensor in the fine-tuning
evaluation of contrast learning with a small amount of labeled data, and also
reveal that not all data augmentation methods will have positive effects in the
contrast learning framework. Finally, we explored the influence of the
combination of different augmentation methods on contrastive learning, and the
experimental results showed that the effect of most combination augmentation
methods was better than that of single augmentation.]]></summary>

severe social concerns and security problems. Existing methods for detecting
GAN-generated faces can perform well on limited public datasets. However,
images from existing public datasets do not represent real-world scenarios well
enough in terms of view variations and data distributions (where real faces
largely outnumber synthetic faces). The state-of-the-art methods do not
generalize well in real-world problems and lack the interpretability of
detection results. Performance of existing GAN-face detection models degrades
significantly when facing imbalanced data distributions. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a robust, attentive, end-to-end network that can spot
GAN-generated faces by analyzing their eye inconsistencies. Specifically, our
model learns to identify inconsistent eye components by localizing and
comparing the iris artifacts between the two eyes automatically. Our deep
network addresses the imbalance learning issues by considering the AUC loss and
the traditional cross-entropy loss jointly. Comprehensive evaluations of the

trade-off is one of the most common criteria. However, in reinforcement
learning (RL) for sequential decision making under uncertainty, most of the
existing methods for MV control suffer from computational difficulties caused
by the double sampling problem. In this paper, in contrast to strict MV
control, we consider learning MV efficient policies that achieve Pareto
efficiency regarding MV trade-off. To achieve this purpose, we train an agent
to maximize the expected quadratic utility function, a common objective of risk
management in finance and economics. We call our approach direct expected
quadratic utility maximization (EQUM). The EQUM does not suffer from the double
sampling issue because it does not include gradient estimation of variance. We
confirm that the maximizer of the objective in the EQUM directly corresponds to
an MV efficient policy under a certain condition. We conduct experiments with

codebook generated by using a plain-image dataset. Encryption-then-compression
(EtC) images, which were proposed for EtC systems, have been used in
conventional privacy-preserving image-retrieval schemes, in which a codebook is
generated from EtC images uploaded by image owners, and extended SIMPLE
descriptors are then calculated as image descriptors by using the codebook. In
contrast, in the proposed scheme, a codebook is generated from a dataset
independent of uploaded images. The use of an independent dataset enables us
not only to use a codebook that does not require recalculation but also to
constantly provide a high retrieval accuracy. In an experiment, the proposed
scheme is demonstrated to maintain a high retrieval performance, even if
codebooks are generated from a plain image dataset independent of image owners'
encrypted images.]]></summary>

task due to its ill-posed nature. One approach is to utilize the plentiful

unsupervised algorithm that can learn a 3D reconstruction network from a

symmetry-required scenario as a special case. Besides, we employ a novel albedo

in the wild. In contrast to existing studies that mainly focus on parsing
well-aligned tabular images with simple layouts from scanned PDF documents, we
aim to establish a practical table structure parsing system for real-world
scenarios where tabular input images are taken or scanned with severe
deformation, bending or occlusions. For designing such a system, we propose an
approach named Cycle-CenterNet on the top of CenterNet with a novel
cycle-pairing module to simultaneously detect and group tabular cells into
structured tables. In the cycle-pairing module, a new pairing loss function is
proposed for the network training. Alongside with our Cycle-CenterNet, we also
present a large-scale dataset, named Wired Table in the Wild (WTW), which
includes well-annotated structure parsing of multiple style tables in several
scenes like the photo, scanning files, web pages, \emph{etc.}. In experiments,
we demonstrate that our Cycle-CenterNet consistently achieves the best accuracy
of table structure parsing on the new WTW dataset by 24.6\% absolute
improvement evaluated by the TEDS metric. A more comprehensive experimental

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In practice, and more especially when training deep neural networks, visual
recognition rules are often learned based on various sources of information. On
the other hand, the recent deployment of facial recognition systems with uneven
predictive performances on different population segments highlights the
representativeness issues possibly induced by a naive aggregation of image
datasets. Indeed, sampling bias does not vanish simply by considering larger
datasets, and ignoring its impact may completely jeopardize the generalization
capacity of the learned prediction rules. In this paper, we show how biasing
models, originally introduced for nonparametric estimation in (Gill et al.,
1988), and recently revisited from the perspective of statistical learning
theory in (Laforgue and Cl\'emen\c{c}on, 2019), can be applied to remedy these
problems in the context of visual recognition. Based on the (approximate)
knowledge of the biasing mechanisms at work, our approach consists in
reweighting the observations, so as to form a nearly debiased estimator of the
target distribution. One key condition for our method to be theoretically valid
is that the supports of the distributions generating the biased datasets at
disposal must overlap, and cover the support of the target distribution. In
order to meet this requirement in practice, we propose to use a low dimensional
image representation, shared across the image databases. Finally, we provide
numerical experiments highlighting the relevance of our approach whenever the
biasing functions are appropriately chosen.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anomaly detection in computer vision is the task of identifying images which
deviate from a set of normal images. A common approach is to train deep
convolutional autoencoders to inpaint covered parts of an image and compare the
output with the original image. By training on anomaly-free samples only, the
model is assumed to not being able to reconstruct anomalous regions properly.
For anomaly detection by inpainting we suggest it to be beneficial to
incorporate information from potentially distant regions. In particular we pose
anomaly detection as a patch-inpainting problem and propose to solve it with a
purely self-attention based approach discarding convolutions. The proposed
Inpainting Transformer (InTra) is trained to inpaint covered patches in a large
sequence of image patches, thereby integrating information across large regions
of the input image. When training from scratch, in comparison to other methods
not using extra training data, InTra achieves results on par with the current
state-of-the-art on the MVTec AD dataset for detection and surpassing them on

methods cannot simultaneously capture the relations at multiple levels,

Multi-Head Self-Attention, and each block uses two parallel branches to learn
spatial and temporal attention respectively. Meanwhile, KTD aims at modeling
the joint level attention. It regards pose estimation as a top-down
hierarchical process similar to SMPL kinematic tree. With the training set of

"How should the network learn a variable number of bounding boxes in different

a procedure that directly assigns the ground truth bounding boxes to the
specific locations of the network's output. However, this procedure makes the
training of a multi-object detection network too heuristic and complicated. In
this paper, we reformulate the multi-object detection task as a problem of
density estimation of bounding boxes. Instead of assigning each ground truth to
specific locations of network's output, we train a network by estimating the
probability density of bounding boxes in an input image using a mixture model.
For this purpose, we propose a novel network for object detection called
Mixture Density Object Detector (MDOD), and the corresponding objective
function for the density-estimation-based training. We applied MDOD to MS COCO

problems in a new approach, but also improves detection performances through

substantially improve accuracy in-distribution, they also reduce

and effective method for improving robustness: ensembling the weights of the
zero-shot and fine-tuned models. Compared to standard fine-tuning, the
resulting weight-space ensembles provide large accuracy improvements
out-of-distribution, while matching or improving in-distribution accuracy. On
ImageNet and five derived distribution shifts, weight-space ensembles improve
out-of-distribution accuracy by 2 to 10 percentage points while increasing
in-distribution accuracy by nearly 1 percentage point relative to standard
fine-tuning. These improvements come at no additional computational cost during

in UAV defense systems. Deep learning is widely adopted for UAV object
detection whereas researches on this topic are limited by the amount of dataset
and small scale of UAV. To tackle these problems, a novel comprehensive
approach that combines transfer learning based on simulation data and adaptive
fusion is proposed. Firstly, the open-source plugin AirSim proposed by
Microsoft is used to generate mass realistic simulation data. Secondly,
transfer learning is applied to obtain a pre-trained YOLOv5 model on the
simulated dataset and fine-tuned model on the real-world dataset. Finally, an
adaptive fusion mechanism is proposed to further improve small object detection
performance. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of
simulation-based transfer learning which leads to a 2.7% performance increase
on UAV object detection. Furthermore, with transfer learning and adaptive
fusion mechanism, 7.1% improvement is achieved compared to the original YOLO v5
model.]]></summary>

and no additional training data, we can produce a range of powerful editing
effects for reducing distraction in images. Given an image and a mask
specifying the region to edit, we backpropagate through a state-of-the-art
saliency model to parameterize a differentiable editing operator, such that the
saliency within the masked region is reduced. We demonstrate several operators,
including: a recoloring operator, which learns to apply a color transform that
camouflages and blends distractors into their surroundings; a warping operator,
which warps less salient image regions to cover distractors, gradually
collapsing objects into themselves and effectively removing them (an effect
akin to inpainting); a GAN operator, which uses a semantic prior to fully
replace image regions with plausible, less salient alternatives. The resulting
effects are consistent with cognitive research on the human visual system
(e.g., since color mismatch is salient, the recoloring operator learns to
harmonize objects' colors with their surrounding to reduce their saliency),
and, importantly, are all achieved solely through the guidance of the
pretrained saliency model, with no additional supervision. We present results
on a variety of natural images and conduct a perceptual study to evaluate and
validate the changes in viewers' eye-gaze between the original images and our
edited results.]]></summary>

consisting of a Mask-RCNN detector, followed by a classification ensemble
consisting of ResNet50 and DenseNet201 to refine detected mitotic candidates.
The MIDOG training data consists of 200 frames originating from four scanners,
three of which are annotated for mitotic instances with centroid annotations.
Our main algorithmic choices are as follows: first, to enhance the
generalizability of our detector and classification networks, we use a
state-of-the-art residual Cycle-GAN to transform each scanner domain to every
other scanner domain. During training, we then randomly load, for each image,
one of the four domains. In this way, our networks can learn from the fourth
non-annotated scanner domain even if we don't have annotations for it. Second,
for training the detector network, rather than using centroid-based fixed-size
bounding boxes, we create mitosis-specific bounding boxes. We do this by
manually annotating a small selection of mitoses, training a Mask-RCNN on this
small dataset, and applying it to the rest of the data to obtain full
annotations. We trained the follow-up classification ensemble using only the
challenge-provided positive and hard-negative examples. On the preliminary test
set, the algorithm scores an F1 score of 0.7578, putting us as the second-place
team on the leaderboard.]]></summary>

correlation clustering) problem, a classical graph clustering problem widely
used in machine learning and computer vision. Our algorithm consists of three
steps executed recursively: (1) Finding conflicted cycles that correspond to
violated inequalities of the underlying multicut relaxation, (2) Performing
message passing between the edges and cycles to optimize the Lagrange
relaxation coming from the found violated cycles producing reduced costs and
(3) Contracting edges with high reduced costs through matrix-matrix
multiplications.

Our algorithm produces primal solutions and dual lower bounds that estimate
the distance to optimum. We implement our algorithm on GPUs and show resulting
one to two order-of-magnitudes improvements in execution speed without
sacrificing solution quality compared to traditional serial algorithms that run
on CPUs. We can solve very large scale benchmark problems with up to
$\mathcal{O}(10^8)$ variables in a few seconds with small primal-dual gaps. We

the guidance of the corresponding auxiliary contrast, which provides additional
anatomical information, is a new and effective solution for fast MR imaging.
However, current multi-contrast super-resolution (SR) methods tend to
concatenate different contrasts directly, ignoring their relationships in
different clues, \eg, in the foreground and background. In this paper, we
propose a separable attention network (comprising a foreground priority
attention and background separation attention), named SANet. Our method can
explore the foreground and background areas in the forward and reverse
directions with the help of the auxiliary contrast, enabling it to learn
clearer anatomical structures and edge information for the SR of a
target-contrast MR image. SANet provides three appealing benefits: (1) It is
the first model to explore a separable attention mechanism that uses the
auxiliary contrast to predict the foreground and background regions, diverting
more attention to refining any uncertain details between these regions and
correcting the fine areas in the reconstructed results. (2) A multi-stage
integration module is proposed to learn the response of multi-contrast fusion
at different stages, obtain the dependency between the fused features, and
improve their representation ability. (3) Extensive experiments with various
state-of-the-art multi-contrast SR methods on fastMRI and clinical \textit{in

improvement for a multitude of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
However, their hefty computational and memory demands make them challenging to
deploy to resource-constrained edge platforms with strict latency requirements.
We present EdgeBERT, an in-depth algorithm-hardware co-design for latency-aware
energy optimization for multi-task NLP. EdgeBERT employs entropy-based early
exit predication in order to perform dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS),
at a sentence granularity, for minimal energy consumption while adhering to a
prescribed target latency. Computation and memory footprint overheads are
further alleviated by employing a calibrated combination of adaptive attention
span, selective network pruning, and floating-point quantization. Furthermore,
in order to maximize the synergistic benefits of these algorithms in always-on
and intermediate edge computing settings, we specialize a 12nm scalable
hardware accelerator system, integrating a fast-switching low-dropout voltage
regulator (LDO), an all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL), as well as,
high-density embedded non-volatile memories (eNVMs) wherein the sparse
floating-point bit encodings of the shared multi-task parameters are carefully
stored. Altogether, latency-aware multi-task NLP inference acceleration on the
EdgeBERT hardware system generates up to 7x, 2.5x, and 53x lower energy
compared to the conventional inference without early stopping, the
latency-unbounded early exit approach, and CUDA adaptations on an Nvidia Jetson
Tegra X2 mobile GPU, respectively.]]></summary>

model architecture improves the results in both inference setups. We also
investigate the impact of partial and complete fine-tuning and analyze the
trade-off between computational power and accuracy in the process. Based on the

Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) information from

annotated span data and using only crowdsourced sentence-level annotations.
Experiments on two datasets show that PICO span detection results achieve much
higher results for recall when compared to fully supervised methods with PICO
sentence detection at least as good as human annotations. By removing the

ground the generation of abstractive summaries. Specifically, we prepend (or
prompt) target summaries with entity chains -- ordered sequences of entities
mentioned in the summary. Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence models are
then trained to generate the entity chain and then continue generating the
summary conditioned on the entity chain and the input. We experimented with
both pretraining and finetuning with this content planning objective. When
evaluated on CNN/DailyMail, XSum, SAMSum and BillSum, we demonstrate
empirically that the grounded generation with the planning objective improves
entity specificity and planning in summaries for all datasets, and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on XSum and SAMSum in terms of Rouge. Moreover, we
demonstrate empirically that planning with entity chains provides a mechanism
to control hallucinations in abstractive summaries. By prompting the decoder
with a modified content plan that drops hallucinated entities, we outperform
state-of-the-art approaches for faithfulness when evaluated automatically and
by humans.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In joint entity and relation extraction, existing work either sequentially
encode task-specific features, leading to an imbalance in inter-task feature
interaction where features extracted later have no direct contact with those
that come first. Or they encode entity features and relation features in a
parallel manner, meaning that feature representation learning for each task is
largely independent of each other except for input sharing. We propose a
partition filter network to model two-way interaction between tasks properly,
where feature encoding is decomposed into two steps: partition and filter. In
our encoder, we leverage two gates: entity and relation gate, to segment
neurons into two task partitions and one shared partition. The shared partition
represents inter-task information valuable to both tasks and is evenly shared
across two tasks to ensure proper two-way interaction. The task partitions
represent intra-task information and are formed through concerted efforts of
both gates, making sure that encoding of task-specific features is dependent
upon each other. Experiment results on six public datasets show that our model
performs significantly better than previous approaches. In addition, contrary
to what previous work claims, our auxiliary experiments suggest that relation
prediction is contributory to named entity prediction in a non-negligible way.

tasks, by simply reading textual instructions that define them and looking at a
few examples. NLP models built with the conventional paradigm, however, often
struggle with generalization across tasks (e.g., a question-answering system
cannot solve classification tasks). A long-standing challenge in AI is to build
a model that is equipped with the understanding of human-readable instructions
that define the tasks, and can generalize to new tasks. To study this, we
introduce NATURAL INSTRUCTIONS, a dataset of 61 distinct tasks, their
human-authored instructions and 193k task instances. The instructions are
obtained from crowdsourcing instructions used to collect existing NLP datasets
and mapped to a unified schema. We adopt generative pre-trained language models
to encode task-specific instructions along with input and generate task output.
Our results indicate that models can benefit from instructions to generalize
across tasks. These models, however, are far behind supervised task-specific
models, indicating significant room for more progress in this direction.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past few years, various word-level textual attack approaches have
been proposed to reveal the vulnerability of deep neural networks used in
natural language processing. Typically, these approaches involve an important
optimization step to determine which substitute to be used for each word in the
original input. However, current research on this step is still rather limited,
from the perspectives of both problem-understanding and problem-solving. In
this paper, we address these issues by uncovering the theoretical properties of
the problem and proposing an efficient local search algorithm (LS) to solve it.
We establish the first provable approximation guarantee on solving the problem
in general cases. Notably, for adversarial textual attack, it is even better
than the previous bound which only holds in special case. Extensive experiments
involving five NLP tasks, six datasets and eleven NLP models show that LS can
largely reduce the number of queries usually by an order of magnitude to
achieve high attack success rates. Further experiments show that the
adversarial examples crafted by LS usually have higher quality, exhibit better
transferability, and can bring more robustness improvement to victim models by
adversarial training.]]></summary>

model-based design methodologies for dynamical systems with data-driven
approaches to achieve this target. We confine our attention to NNs with
Rectifier Linear Unit (ReLU) nonlinearity which are known to represent
Continuous Piece-Wise Affine (CPWA) functions. Given a mathematical model of
the dynamical system, we compute a finite-state abstract model that captures
the closed-loop behavior under all possible CPWA controllers. Using this
finite-state abstract model, our framework identifies a family of CPWA
functions guaranteed to satisfy the safety requirements. We augment the
learning algorithm with a NN weight projection operator during training that
enforces the resulting NN to represent a CPWA function from the provably safe
family of CPWA functions. Moreover, the proposed framework uses the
finite-state abstract model to identify candidate CPWA functions that may
satisfy the liveness properties. Using such candidate CPWA functions, the
proposed framework biases the NN training to achieve the liveness
specification. We show the efficacy of the proposed framework both in

examples, and each value induces a distribution over the output vocabulary. Our
experiments show that the learned patterns are human-interpretable, and that
lower layers tend to capture shallow patterns, while upper layers learn more

output distributions that concentrate probability mass on tokens likely to
appear immediately after each pattern, particularly in the upper layers.
Finally, we demonstrate that the output of a feed-forward layer is a
composition of its memories, which is subsequently refined throughout the

small number of examples. Specifically, we fine-tune GPT-Neo to solve the
numbers__div_remainder task from the DeepMind Mathematics Dataset; Saxton et
al. (arXiv:1904.01557) reported below 40% accuracy on this task with 2 million
training examples. We show that after fine-tuning on 200 appropriately
structured demonstrations of solving long division problems and reporting the
remainders, the smallest available GPT-Neo model achieves over 80% accuracy.
This is achieved by constructing an appropriate dataset for fine-tuning, with
no changes to the learning algorithm. These results suggest that fine-tuning
autoregressive language models on small sets of well-crafted demonstrations may
be a useful paradigm for enabling individuals without training in machine
learning to coax such models to perform some kinds of complex multi-step tasks.]]></summary>

waste-sorting is needed. The goal of automating waste-sorting is to replace the
human role of robust detection and agile manipulation of waste items with
robots. To achieve this, we propose three methods. First, we provide a combined
manipulation method using graspless push-and-drop and pick-and-release
manipulation. Second, we provide a robotic system that can automatically
collect object images to quickly train a deep neural-network model. Third, we
provide a method to mitigate the differences in the appearance of target
objects from two scenes: one for dataset collection and the other for waste
sorting in a recycling factory. If differences exist, the performance of a
trained waste detector may decrease. We address differences in illumination and
background by applying object scaling, histogram matching with histogram
equalization, and background synthesis to the source target-object images. Via
experiments in an indoor experimental workplace for waste-sorting, we confirm
that the proposed methods enable quick collection of the training image sets
for three classes of waste items (i.e., aluminum can, glass bottle, and plastic
bottle) and detection with higher performance than the methods that do not
consider the differences. We also confirm that the proposed method enables the

segmentation in the context of agricultural robotics without temporally
labelled data. We achieve this by proposing to generate virtual temporal
samples from labelled still images. By exploiting the relatively static scene
and assuming that the robot (camera) moves we are able to generate virtually
labelled temporal sequences with no extra annotation effort. Normally, to train
a recurrent neural network (RNN), labelled samples from a video (temporal)
sequence are required which is laborious and has stymied work in this
direction. By generating virtual temporal samples, we demonstrate that it is
possible to train a lightweight RNN to perform semantic segmentation on two
challenging agricultural datasets. Our results show that by training a temporal
semantic segmenter using virtual samples we can increase the performance by an
absolute amount of $4.6$ and $4.9$ on sweet pepper and sugar beet datasets,
respectively. This indicates that our virtual data augmentation technique is
able to accurately classify agricultural images temporally without the use of
complicated synthetic data generation techniques nor with the overhead of
labelling large amounts of temporal sequences.]]></summary>

To this end, we perform an exploratory analysis of the effectiveness of counter
speech using several different macro- and micro-level measures to analyze

the dynamics of hate and counter speech online. While we make no causal claims

concepts such as objects and actions, understanding semantics and language
grounding, and reasoning about the interplay between the two modalities. One
crucial aspect of visual reasoning is spatial understanding, which involves
understanding relative locations of objects, i.e.\ implicitly learning the
geometry of the scene. In this work, we evaluate the faithfulness of V\&L
models to such geometric understanding, by formulating the prediction of
pair-wise relative locations of objects as a classification as well as a
regression task. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art transformer-based
V\&L models lack sufficient abilities to excel at this task. Motivated by this,
we design two objectives as proxies for 3D spatial reasoning (SR) -- object
centroid estimation, and relative position estimation, and train V\&L with weak
supervision from off-the-shelf depth estimators. This leads to considerable
improvements in accuracy for the "GQA" visual question answering challenge (in
fully supervised, few-shot, and O.O.D settings) as well as improvements in
relative spatial reasoning. Code and data will be released

design a novel two-pathway architecture, in which the scene branch encodes the

training in heavily cluttered scenes, we propose a scene-guided training
strategy to solve the 3D space ambiguity in the occluded regions and learn
sharp boundaries for each object. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our

explanation that deduces not only the important features of an input space but
also how those features should be modified to classify input as a target class
has gained an increasing interest. The patterns that deep networks have learned
from a training dataset can be grasped by observing the feature variation among
various classes. However, current approaches perform the feature modification
to increase the classification probability for the target class irrespective of
the internal characteristics of deep networks. This often leads to unclear
explanations that deviate from real-world data distributions. To address this
problem, we propose a counterfactual explanation method that exploits the
statistics learned from a training dataset. Especially, we gradually construct
an explanation by iterating over masking and composition steps. The masking
step aims to select an important feature from the input data to be classified
as a target class. Meanwhile, the composition step aims to optimize the
previously selected feature by ensuring that its output score is close to the
logit space of the training data that are classified as the target class.
Experimental results show that our method produces human-friendly
interpretations on various classification datasets and verify that such
interpretations can be achieved with fewer feature modification.]]></summary>

express the objects, attributes, and relationships between objects in the
scene. As computer vision technology continues to develop, people are no longer
satisfied with simply detecting and recognizing objects in images; instead,
people look forward to a higher level of understanding and reasoning about
visual scenes. For example, given an image, we want to not only detect and
recognize objects in the image, but also know the relationship between objects
(visual relationship detection), and generate a text description (image
captioning) based on the image content. Alternatively, we might want the
machine to tell us what the little girl in the image is doing (Visual Question
Answering (VQA)), or even remove the dog from the image and find similar images
(image editing and retrieval), etc. These tasks require a higher level of
understanding and reasoning for image vision tasks. The scene graph is just
such a powerful tool for scene understanding. Therefore, scene graphs have
attracted the attention of a large number of researchers, and related research
is often cross-modal, complex, and rapidly developing. However, no relatively
systematic survey of scene graphs exists at present. To this end, this survey
conducts a comprehensive investigation of the current scene graph research.
More specifically, we first summarized the general definition of the scene
graph, then conducted a comprehensive and systematic discussion on the
generation method of the scene graph (SGG) and the SGG with the aid of prior
knowledge. We then investigated the main applications of scene graphs and
summarized the most commonly used datasets. Finally, we provide some insights
into the future development of scene graphs. We believe this will be a very
helpful foundation for future research on scene graphs.]]></summary>

Near-perfect supervised methods have been developed for use in resource-rich

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Conversational recommender systems have attracted immense attention recently.
The most recent approaches rely on neural models trained on recorded dialogs
between humans, implementing an end-to-end learning process. These systems are
commonly designed to generate responses given the user's utterances in natural
language. One main challenge is that these generated responses both have to be
appropriate for the given dialog context and must be grammatically and
semantically correct. An alternative to such generation-based approaches is to
retrieve responses from pre-recorded dialog data and to adapt them if needed.
Such retrieval-based approaches were successfully explored in the context of
general conversational systems, but have received limited attention in recent
years for CRS. In this work, we re-assess the potential of such approaches and
design and evaluate a novel technique for response retrieval and ranking. A
user study (N=90) revealed that the responses by our system were on average of
higher quality than those of two recent generation-based systems. We
furthermore found that the quality ranking of the two generation-based
approaches is not aligned with the results from the literature, which points to
open methodological questions. Overall, our research underlines that
retrieval-based approaches should be considered an alternative or complement to
language generation approaches.]]></summary>

of the serious health effects of COVID-19 and because of public health measures
implemented to slow its spread. Many of these difficulties are fundamentally
information needs; attempts to address these needs have caused an information
overload for both researchers and the public. Natural language processing
(NLP), the branch of artificial intelligence that interprets human language,
can be applied to address many of the information needs made urgent by the
COVID-19 pandemic. This review surveys approximately 150 NLP studies and more
than 50 systems and datasets addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We detail work
on four core NLP tasks: information retrieval, named entity recognition,
literature-based discovery, and question answering. We also describe work that
directly addresses aspects of the pandemic through four additional tasks: topic
modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, caseload forecasting, and
misinformation detection. We conclude by discussing observable trends and
remaining challenges.]]></summary>

the NER task. We investigate the possibility of leveraging data from
high-resource domains by projecting it into the low-resource domains.
Specifically, we propose a novel neural architecture to transform the data
representation from a high-resource to a low-resource domain by learning the
patterns (e.g. style, noise, abbreviations, etc.) in the text that
differentiate them and a shared feature space where both domains are aligned.
We experiment with diverse datasets and show that transforming the data to the

widely used in natural language processing for learning text representations.
MLM trains a model to predict a random sample of input tokens that have been
replaced by a [MASK] placeholder in a multi-class setting over the entire
vocabulary. When pretraining, it is common to use alongside MLM other auxiliary
objectives on the token or sequence level to improve downstream performance
(e.g. next sentence prediction). However, no previous work so far has attempted
in examining whether other simpler linguistically intuitive or not objectives
can be used standalone as main pretraining objectives. In this paper, we
explore five simple pretraining objectives based on token-level classification
tasks as replacements of MLM. Empirical results on GLUE and SQuAD show that our
proposed methods achieve comparable or better performance to MLM using a
BERT-BASE architecture. We further validate our methods using smaller models,
showing that pretraining a model with 41% of the BERT-BASE's parameters,
BERT-MEDIUM results in only a 1% drop in GLUE scores with our best objective.]]></summary>

concepts such as objects and actions, understanding semantics and language
grounding, and reasoning about the interplay between the two modalities. One
crucial aspect of visual reasoning is spatial understanding, which involves
understanding relative locations of objects, i.e.\ implicitly learning the
geometry of the scene. In this work, we evaluate the faithfulness of V\&L
models to such geometric understanding, by formulating the prediction of
pair-wise relative locations of objects as a classification as well as a
regression task. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art transformer-based
V\&L models lack sufficient abilities to excel at this task. Motivated by this,
we design two objectives as proxies for 3D spatial reasoning (SR) -- object
centroid estimation, and relative position estimation, and train V\&L with weak
supervision from off-the-shelf depth estimators. This leads to considerable
improvements in accuracy for the "GQA" visual question answering challenge (in
fully supervised, few-shot, and O.O.D settings) as well as improvements in
relative spatial reasoning. Code and data will be released

extensively used in online chatting scenarios since they manage to make
dialogues vivid, moving, and interesting. However, most current dialogue
researches focus on text-only dialogue tasks. In this paper, we propose a new
task named as \textbf{M}eme incorporated \textbf{O}pen-domain \textbf{D}ialogue

it requires the model to understand the multimodal elements as well as the
emotions behind them. To facilitate the MOD research, we construct a
large-scale open-domain multimodal dialogue dataset incorporating abundant
Internet memes into utterances. The dataset consists of $\sim$45K Chinese
conversations with $\sim$606K utterances. Each conversation contains about $13$
utterances with about $4$ Internet memes on average and each utterance equipped
with an Internet meme is annotated with the corresponding emotion. In addition,
we present a simple and effective method, which utilizes a unified generation
network to solve the MOD task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
trained on the proposed corpus is able to achieve expressive communication
including texts and memes. The corpus and models have been publicly available

pretraining. In the cross-modal setting, tokens in the sentence are masked at
random, and the model predicts the masked tokens given the image and the text.
In this paper, we observe several key disadvantages of MLM in this setting.
First, as captions tend to be short, in a third of the sentences no token is
sampled. Second, the majority of masked tokens are stop-words and punctuation,
leading to under-utilization of the image. We investigate a range of
alternative masking strategies specific to the cross-modal setting that address
these shortcomings, aiming for better fusion of text and image in the learned
representation. When pre-training the LXMERT model, our alternative masking
strategies consistently improve over the original masking strategy on three
downstream tasks, especially in low resource settings. Further, our
pre-training approach substantially outperforms the baseline model on a
prompt-based probing task designed to elicit image objects. These results and
our analysis indicate that our method allows for better utilization of the
training data.]]></summary>

computational solutions that are both effective and efficient. A common
approach is to represent data objects as binary vectors, denoted \textit{hash
codes}, which require little storage and enable efficient similarity search
through direct indexing into a hash table or through similarity computations in
an appropriate space. Due to the limited expressibility of hash codes, compared
to real-valued representations, a core open challenge is how to generate hash
codes that well capture semantic content or latent properties using a small
number of bits, while ensuring that the hash codes are distributed in a way
that does not reduce their search efficiency. State of the art methods use
representation learning for generating such hash codes, focusing on neural
autoencoder architectures where semantics are encoded into the hash codes by
learning to reconstruct the original inputs of the hash codes. This thesis
addresses the above challenge and makes a number of contributions to
representation learning that (i) improve effectiveness of hash codes through
more expressive representations and a more effective similarity measure than
the current state of the art, namely the Hamming distance, and (ii) improve
efficiency of hash codes by learning representations that are especially suited
to the choice of search method. The contributions are empirically validated on
several tasks related to similarity search and recommendation.]]></summary>

on randomly sampled targets, yet the same systems are later used to predict
user behavior sequentially from a fixed point in time. Simulating online
recommender system performance is notoriously difficult and the discrepancy
between online and offline behaviors is typically not accounted for in offline
evaluations. This disparity permits weaknesses to go unnoticed until the model
is deployed in a production setting. In this paper, we first demonstrate how
omitting temporal context when evaluating recommender system performance leads
to false confidence. To overcome this, we postulate that offline evaluation
protocols can only model real-life use-cases if they account for temporal
context. Next, we propose a training procedure to further embed the temporal
context in existing models. We use a multi-objective approach to introduce
temporal context into traditionally time-unaware recommender systems and
confirm its advantage via the proposed evaluation protocol. Finally, we
validate that the Pareto Fronts obtained with the added objective dominate
those produced by state-of-the-art models that are only optimized for accuracy
on three real-world publicly available datasets. The results show that
including our temporal objective can improve recall@20 by up to 20%.]]></summary>

employ recommender systems in their online businesses, e.g., personalized
purchase prediction of shopping baskets. While most previous techniques have

Embedding (GLOIE) that learns to utilize the temporal properties of sets across
whole users as well as within a user by coining the names as global and local
information to distinguish the two temporal patterns. GLOIE uses Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) and dynamic graph-based model to capture global and local
information and then applies attention to integrate resulting item embeddings.
Additionally, we propose to use Tweedie output for the decoder of VAE as it can
easily model zero-inflated and long-tailed distribution, which is more suitable
for several real-world data distributions than Gaussian or multinomial
counterparts. When evaluated on three public benchmarks, our algorithm
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in most ranking

identify named entities from user queries as diverse surface form attribute
values and afterward transform them into formally canonical forms. Such a
problem consists of two phases: {named entity recognition (NER)} and {attribute
value normalization (AVN)}. However, existing works only focus on the NER phase
but neglect equally important AVN. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a
unified query attribute value extraction system in e-commerce search named
QUEACO, which involves both two phases. Moreover, by leveraging large-scale
weakly-labeled behavior data, we further improve the extraction performance
with less supervision cost. Specifically, for the NER phase, QUEACO adopts a
novel teacher-student network, where a teacher network that is trained on the
strongly-labeled data generates pseudo-labels to refine the weakly-labeled data
for training a student network. Meanwhile, the teacher network can be
dynamically adapted by the feedback of the student's performance on
strongly-labeled data to maximally denoise the noisy supervisions from the weak
labels. For the AVN phase, we also leverage the weakly-labeled
query-to-attribute behavior data to normalize surface form attribute values
from queries into canonical forms from products. Extensive experiments on a
real-world large-scale E-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
QUEACO.]]></summary>

like recommendation. The explanation also has the arduous task of enhancing

Recent studies propose supervised PQ, where the embedding and quantization
models can be jointly trained with supervised learning. However, there is a
lack of appropriate formulation of the joint training objective; thus, the
improvements over previous non-supervised baselines are limited in reality. In
this work, we propose the Matching-oriented Product Quantization (MoPQ), where
a novel objective Multinoulli Contrastive Loss (MCL) is formulated. With the
minimization of MCL, we are able to maximize the matching probability of query
and ground-truth key, which contributes to the optimal retrieval accuracy.
Given that the exact computation of MCL is intractable due to the demand of
vast contrastive samples, we further propose the Differentiable Cross-device
Sampling (DCS), which significantly augments the contrastive samples for
precise approximation of MCL. We conduct extensive experimental studies on four

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most Fairness in AI research focuses on exposing biases in AI systems. A
broader lens on fairness reveals that AI can serve a greater aspiration:
rooting out societal inequities from their source. Specifically, we focus on
inequities in health information, and aim to reduce bias in that domain using
AI. The AI algorithms under the hood of search engines and social media, many
of which are based on recommender systems, have an outsized impact on the
quality of medical and health information online. Therefore, embedding bias
detection and reduction into these recommender systems serving up medical and
health content online could have an outsized positive impact on patient
outcomes and wellbeing.

In this position paper, we offer the following contributions: (1) we propose
a novel framework of Fairness via AI, inspired by insights from medical
education, sociology and antiracism; (2) we define a new term, bisinformation,
which is related to, but distinct from, misinformation, and encourage
researchers to study it; (3) we propose using AI to study, detect and mitigate
biased, harmful, and/or false health information that disproportionately hurts
minority groups in society; and (4) we suggest several pillars and pose several
open problems in order to seed inquiry in this new space. While part (3) of
this work specifically focuses on the health domain, the fundamental computer
science advances and contributions stemming from research efforts in bias
reduction and Fairness via AI have broad implications in all areas of society.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Question Answering (QA), a popular and promising technique for intelligent
information access, faces a dilemma about data as most other AI techniques. On
one hand, modern QA methods rely on deep learning models which are typically
data-hungry. Therefore, it is expected to collect and fuse all the available QA
datasets together in a common site for developing a powerful QA model. On the
other hand, real-world QA datasets are typically distributed in the form of
isolated islands belonging to different parties. Due to the increasing
awareness of privacy security, it is almost impossible to integrate the data
scattered around, or the cost is prohibited. A possible solution to this
dilemma is a new approach known as federated learning, which is a
privacy-preserving machine learning technique over distributed datasets. In
this work, we propose to adopt federated learning for QA with the special
concern on the statistical heterogeneity of the QA data. Here the heterogeneity
refers to the fact that annotated QA data are typically with non-identical and
independent distribution (non-IID) and unbalanced sizes in practice.
Traditional federated learning methods may sacrifice the accuracy of individual
models under the heterogeneous situation. To tackle this problem, we propose a
novel Federated Matching framework for QA, named FedMatch, with a
backbone-patch architecture. The shared backbone is to distill the common
knowledge of all the participants while the private patch is a compact and
efficient module to retain the domain information for each participant. To
facilitate the evaluation, we build a benchmark collection based on several QA
datasets from different domains to simulate the heterogeneous situation in
practice. Empirical studies demonstrate that our model can achieve significant
improvements against the baselines over all the datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How data is represented and operationalized is critical for building
computational solutions that are both effective and efficient. A common
approach is to represent data objects as binary vectors, denoted \textit{hash
codes}, which require little storage and enable efficient similarity search
through direct indexing into a hash table or through similarity computations in
an appropriate space. Due to the limited expressibility of hash codes, compared
to real-valued representations, a core open challenge is how to generate hash
codes that well capture semantic content or latent properties using a small
number of bits, while ensuring that the hash codes are distributed in a way
that does not reduce their search efficiency. State of the art methods use
representation learning for generating such hash codes, focusing on neural
autoencoder architectures where semantics are encoded into the hash codes by
learning to reconstruct the original inputs of the hash codes. This thesis
addresses the above challenge and makes a number of contributions to
representation learning that (i) improve effectiveness of hash codes through
more expressive representations and a more effective similarity measure than
the current state of the art, namely the Hamming distance, and (ii) improve
efficiency of hash codes by learning representations that are especially suited
to the choice of search method. The contributions are empirically validated on
several tasks related to similarity search and recommendation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To alleviate data sparsity and cold-start problems of traditional recommender
systems (RSs), incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs) to supplement auxiliary
information has attracted considerable attention recently. However, simply
integrating KGs in current KG-based RS models is not necessarily a guarantee to
improve the recommendation performance, which may even weaken the holistic
model capability. This is because the construction of these KGs is independent
of the collection of historical user-item interactions; hence, information in
these KGs may not always be helpful for recommendation to all users.

In this paper, we propose attentive Knowledge-aware Graph convolutional
networks with Collaborative Guidance for personalized Recommendation (CG-KGR).
CG-KGR is a novel knowledge-aware recommendation model that enables ample and
coherent learning of KGs and user-item interactions, via our proposed
Collaborative Guidance Mechanism. Specifically, CG-KGR first encapsulates
historical interactions to interactive information summarization. Then CG-KGR
utilizes it as guidance to extract information out of KGs, which eventually
provides more precise personalized recommendation. We conduct extensive
experiments on four real-world datasets over two recommendation tasks, i.e.,
Top-K recommendation and Click-Through rate (CTR) prediction. The experimental
results show that the CG-KGR model significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art models by 4.0-53.2% and 0.4-3.2%, in terms of Recall metric on
Top-K recommendation and AUC on CTR prediction, respectively.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Active learning has emerged as a standard paradigm in areas with scarcity of
labeled training data, such as in the medical domain. Language models have
emerged as the prevalent choice of several natural language tasks due to the
performance boost offered by these models. However, in several domains, such as
medicine, the scarcity of labeled training data is a common issue. Also, these
models may not work well in cases where class imbalance is prevalent. Active
learning may prove helpful in these cases to boost the performance with a
limited label budget. To this end, we propose a novel method using sampling
techniques based on submodular optimization and optimal transport for active
learning in language models, dubbed ALLWAS. We construct a sampling strategy
based on submodular optimization of the designed objective in the gradient
domain. Furthermore, to enable learning from few samples, we propose a novel
strategy for sampling from the Wasserstein barycenters. Our empirical
evaluations on standard benchmark datasets for text classification show that
our methods perform significantly better (>20% relative increase in some cases)
than existing approaches for active learning on language models.]]></summary>

planning. We develop a machine learning model, based on Random Forest, for
demand prediction and utilize the model further to define a generalized index
to measure quality of fire service in urban settings. Our model is built upon
spatial data collected from multiple different sources. Efficacy of proper
facility planning depends on choice of candidates where fire stations can be
located along with existing stations, if any. Also, the travel time from these
candidates to demand locations need to be taken care of to maintain fire safety
standard. Here, we propose a travel time based clustering technique to identify
suitable candidates. Finally, we develop an optimization problem to select best
locations to install new fire stations. Our optimization problem is built upon
maximum coverage problem, based on integer programming. We present a detailed
experimental study of our proposed approach in collaboration with city of
Victoria Fire Department, MN, USA. Our demand prediction model achieves true
positive rate of 70% and false positive rate of 22% approximately. We aid
Victoria Fire Department to select a location for a new fire station using our
approach. We present detailed results on improvement statistics by locating a
new facility, as suggested by our methodology, in the city of Victoria.]]></summary>
