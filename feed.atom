        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maintaining the long-term exploration capability of the agent remains one of
the critical challenges in deep reinforcement learning. A representative
solution is to leverage reward shaping to provide intrinsic rewards for the
agent to encourage exploration. However, most existing methods suffer from
vanishing intrinsic rewards, which cannot provide sustainable exploration
incentives. Moreover, they rely heavily on complex models and additional memory
to record learning procedures, resulting in high computational complexity and
low robustness. To tackle this problem, entropy-based methods are proposed to
evaluate the global exploration performance, encouraging the agent to visit the
state space more equitably. However, the sample complexity of estimating the
state visitation entropy is prohibitive when handling environments with
high-dimensional observations. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric
entitled Jain's fairness index (JFI) to replace the entropy regularizer, which
solves the exploration problem from a brand new perspective. In sharp contrast
to the entropy regularizer, JFI is more computable and robust and can be easily
applied generalized into arbitrary tasks. Furthermore, we leverage a
variational auto-encoder (VAE) model to capture the life-long novelty of
states, which is combined with the global JFI score to form multimodal
intrinsic rewards. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that our
multimodal reward shaping (MMRS) method can achieve higher performance than
other benchmark schemes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce Neural Marching Cubes (NMC), a data-driven approach for
extracting a triangle mesh from a discretized implicit field. Classical MC is
defined by coarse tessellation templates isolated to individual cubes. While
more refined tessellations have been proposed, they all make heuristic
assumptions, such as trilinearity, when determining the vertex positions and
local mesh topologies in each cube. In principle, none of these approaches can
reconstruct geometric features that reveal coherence or dependencies between
nearby cubes (e.g., a sharp edge), as such information is unaccounted for,
resulting in poor estimates of the true underlying implicit field. To tackle
these challenges, we re-cast MC from a deep learning perspective, by designing
tessellation templates more apt at preserving geometric features, and learning
the vertex positions and mesh topologies from training meshes, to account for
contextual information from nearby cubes. We develop a compact per-cube
parameterization to represent the output triangle mesh, while being compatible
with neural processing, so that a simple 3D convolutional network can be
employed for the training. We show that all topological cases in each cube that
are applicable to our design can be easily derived using our representation,
and the resulting tessellations can also be obtained naturally and efficiently
by following a few design guidelines. In addition, our network learns local
features with limited receptive fields, hence it generalizes well to new shapes
and new datasets. We evaluate our neural MC approach by quantitative and
qualitative comparisons to all well-known MC variants. In particular, we
demonstrate the ability of our network to recover sharp features such as edges
and corners, a long-standing issue of MC and its variants. Our network also
reconstructs local mesh topologies more accurately than previous approaches.]]></summary>

(cryo-EM), the Multi-Reference Alignment (MRA) model entails the learning of an
unknown signal from repeated measurements of its images under the latent action
of a group of isometries and additive noise of magnitude $\sigma$. Despite
significant interest, a clear picture for understanding rates of estimation in
this model has emerged only recently, particularly in the high-noise regime
$\sigma \gg 1$ that is highly relevant in applications. Recent investigations
have revealed a remarkable asymptotic sample complexity of order $\sigma^6$ for
certain signals whose Fourier transforms have full support, in stark contrast
to the traditional $\sigma^2$ that arise in regular models. Often prohibitively
large in practice, these results have prompted the investigation of variations
around the MRA model where better sample complexity may be achieved. In this
paper, we show that \emph{sparse} signals exhibit an intermediate $\sigma^4$
sample complexity even in the classical MRA model. Our results explore and
exploit connections of the MRA estimation problem with two classical topics in
applied mathematics: the \textit{beltway problem} from combinatorial
optimization, and \textit{uniform uncertainty principles} from harmonic
analysis.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Measuring the predictability and complexity of time series is an essential
tool in designing and controlling the nonlinear system. Different entropy
measures exist in the literature to analyze the predictability and complexity
of time series. However, the existed methods have some drawbacks related to a
strong dependence of entropy on the parameters of the methods, as well as on
the length and amplitude of the time series. To overcome these difficulties,
this study proposes a new method for estimating the entropy of a time series
using the LogNNet neural network model. The LogNNet reservoir matrix is filled
with the time series elements according to our algorithm. The network is
trained on MNIST-10 dataset and the classification accuracy is calculated. The
accuracy is considered as the entropy measure and denoted by NNetEn. The
novelty of entropy calculation is that the time series is involved in mixing
the input information in the reservoir. The greater complexity of the time
series leads to the better ability of the neural network to learn, and to the
higher classification accuracy and NNetEn values. The epochs number in the
training process of LogNNet is considered as the control parameter. We
introduce a new time series characteristic, called time series learning
inertia, that determines the learning rate of the neural network. The
robustness and efficiency of the method is verified on chaotic, periodic,
random, binary and constant time series. The comparison of NNetEn with other
methods of entropy estimation demonstrates that our method is more robust and
accurate and can be widely used in practice.]]></summary>

Management (PHM) of industrial asset is presented. This work provides an
overview of the general trend of XAI in PHM, answers the question of accuracy
versus explainability, the extent of human involvement, the explanation
assessment and uncertainty quantification in PHM-XAI domain. Research articles
associated with the subject, from 2015 to 2021 were selected from five known
databases following PRISMA guidelines. Data was then extracted from the
selected articles and examined. Several findings were synthesized. Firstly,
while the discipline is still young, the analysis indicated the growing
acceptance of XAI in PHM domain. Secondly, XAI functions as a double edge
sword, where it is assimilated as a tool to execute PHM tasks as well as a mean
of explanation, particularly in diagnostic and anomaly detection activities,
implying a real need for XAI in PHM. Thirdly, the review showed that PHM-XAI
papers produce either good or excellent result in general, suggesting that PHM
performance is unaffected by XAI. Fourthly, human role, evaluation metrics and
uncertainty management are areas requiring further attention by the PHM
community. Adequate assessment metrics to cater for PHM need are urgently
needed.Finally, most case study featured on the accepted articles are based on
real, industrial data, indicating that the available PHM-XAI blends are fit to
solve complex,real-world challenges, increasing the confidence in AI adoption

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper studies a class of constrained restless multi-armed bandits
(CRMAB). The constraints are in the form of time varying set of actions (set of
available arms). This variation can be either stochastic or semi-deterministic.
Given a set of arms, a fixed number of them can be chosen to be played in each
decision interval. The play of each arm yields a state dependent reward. The
current states of arms are partially observable through binary feedback signals
from arms that are played. The current availability of arms is fully
observable. The objective is to maximize long term cumulative reward. The
uncertainty about future availability of arms along with partial state
information makes this objective challenging. Applications for CRMAB can be
found in resource allocation in cyber-physical systems involving components
with time varying availability.

First, this optimization problem is analyzed using Whittle's index policy. To
this end, a constrained restless single-armed bandit is studied. It is shown to
admit a threshold-type optimal policy and is also indexable. An algorithm to
compute Whittle's index is presented. An alternate solution method with lower
complexity is also presented in the form of an online rollout policy. A
detailed discussion on the complexity of both these schemes is also presented,
which suggests that online rollout policy with short look ahead is simpler to
implement than Whittle's index computation. Further, upper bounds on the value
function are derived in order to estimate the degree of sub-optimality of
various solutions. The simulation study compares the performance of Whittle's
index, online rollout, myopic and modified Whittle's index policies.]]></summary>

strategies to achieve the net emissions reductions that would be required to
follow a pathway that limits global warming to 1.5{\deg}C with no or limited
overshoot. The transition towards a carbon-free society goes through an
inevitable increase in the share of renewable generation in the energy mix and
a drastic decrease in the total consumption of fossil fuels. Therefore, this
thesis studies the integration of renewables in power systems by investigating
forecasting and decision-making tools. Indeed, in contrast to conventional
power plants, renewable energy is subject to uncertainty. Most of the
generation technologies based on renewable sources are non-dispatchable, and
their production is stochastic and complex to predict in advance. A high share
of renewables is challenging for power systems that have been designed and
sized for dispatchable units. In this context, probabilistic forecasts, which
aim at modeling the distribution of all possible future realizations, have
become a vital tool to equip decision-makers, hopefully leading to better
decisions in energy applications. This thesis focuses on two main research
questions: (1) How to produce reliable probabilistic renewable generation
forecasts, consumption, and electricity prices? (2) How to make decisions with
uncertainty using probabilistic forecasts? The thesis perimeter is the energy
management of "small" systems such as microgrids at a residential scale on a
day-ahead basis. It is divided into two main parts to propose directions to
address both research questions (1) a forecasting part; (2) a planning and
control part.]]></summary>

"content" image, to share similar texture and colors of a target "style" image.
Ideally, the style transfer manipulation should also preserve the semantic
content of the source image. A commonly used approach to assist in transferring
styles is based on Gram matrix optimization. One problem of Gram matrix-based
optimization is that it does not consider the correlation between colors and
their styles. Specifically, certain textures or structures should be associated
with specific colors. This is particularly challenging when the target style
image exhibits multiple style types. In this work, we propose a color-aware
multi-style transfer method that generates aesthetically pleasing results while
preserving the style-color correlation between style and generated images. We
achieve this desired outcome by introducing a simple but efficient modification
to classic Gram matrix-based style transfer optimization. A nice feature of our
method is that it enables the users to manually select the color associations
between the target style and content image for more transfer flexibility. We
validated our method with several qualitative comparisons, including a user
study conducted with 30 participants. In comparison with prior work, our method
is simple, easy to implement, and achieves visually appealing results when
targeting images that have multiple styles. Source code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Incorrectly labeled examples, or label noise, is common in real-world
computer vision datasets. While the impact of label noise on learning in deep
neural networks has been studied in prior work, these studies have exclusively
focused on homogeneous label noise, i.e., the degree of label noise is the same
across all categories. However, in the real-world, label noise is often
heterogeneous, with some categories being affected to a greater extent than
others. Here, we address this gap in the literature. We hypothesized that
heterogeneous label noise would only affect the classes that had label noise
unless there was transfer from those classes to the classes without label
noise. To test this hypothesis, we designed a series of computer vision studies
using MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MS-COCO where we imposed heterogeneous
label noise during the training of multi-class, multi-task, and multi-label
systems. Our results provide evidence in support of our hypothesis: label noise
only affects the class affected by it unless there is transfer.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many works in the recent literature introduce semantic mapping methods that
use CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to recognize semantic properties in
images. The types of properties (eg.: room size, place category, and objects)
and their classes (eg.: kitchen and bathroom, for place category) are usually
predefined and restricted to a specific task. Thus, all the visual data
acquired and processed during the construction of the maps are lost and only
the recognized semantic properties remain on the maps. In contrast, this work
introduces a topological semantic mapping method that uses deep visual features
extracted by a CNN (GoogLeNet), from 2D images captured in multiple views of
the environment as the robot operates, to create, through averages,
consolidated representations of the visual features acquired in the regions
covered by each topological node. These representations allow flexible
recognition of semantic properties of the regions and use in other visual
tasks. Experiments with a real-world indoor dataset showed that the method is
able to consolidate the visual features of regions and use them to recognize
objects and place categories as semantic properties, and to indicate the
topological location of images, with very promising results.]]></summary>

full reference (FR) case, yet challenging in the exploding no reference (NR)
case. We investigate variants of the popular VMAF video quality assessment
algorithm for the FR case, using both support vector regression and feedforward
neural networks. We extend it to the NR case, using some different features but
similar learning, to develop a partially unified framework for VQA. When fully
trained, FR algorithms such as VMAF perform well on test datasets, with 90%+
match in PCC and SRCC; but for predicting performance in the wild, we
train/test from scratch for each database. With an 80/20 train/test split, we
still achieve 90%+ performance on average in both PCC and SRCC, with 8-9% gains
over VMAF. Moreover, we even get decent performance (~75%) if we ignore the
reference, treating FR as NR, partly justifying our attempts at unification. In
the true NR case, we reduce complexity vs. leading recent algorithms VIDEVAL,
RAPIQUE, yet achieve a stunning 90% in SRCC (~12% gain), while roughly matching
in PCC (78% vs. 79.6%). At lower complexities, we can still achieve 87% in
SRCC, 70% in PCC. In short, we find encouraging improvements in trainability in

methods for food recognition. The core of the paper is the presentation,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce Neural Marching Cubes (NMC), a data-driven approach for
extracting a triangle mesh from a discretized implicit field. Classical MC is
defined by coarse tessellation templates isolated to individual cubes. While
more refined tessellations have been proposed, they all make heuristic
assumptions, such as trilinearity, when determining the vertex positions and
local mesh topologies in each cube. In principle, none of these approaches can
reconstruct geometric features that reveal coherence or dependencies between
nearby cubes (e.g., a sharp edge), as such information is unaccounted for,
resulting in poor estimates of the true underlying implicit field. To tackle
these challenges, we re-cast MC from a deep learning perspective, by designing
tessellation templates more apt at preserving geometric features, and learning
the vertex positions and mesh topologies from training meshes, to account for
contextual information from nearby cubes. We develop a compact per-cube
parameterization to represent the output triangle mesh, while being compatible
with neural processing, so that a simple 3D convolutional network can be
employed for the training. We show that all topological cases in each cube that
are applicable to our design can be easily derived using our representation,
and the resulting tessellations can also be obtained naturally and efficiently
by following a few design guidelines. In addition, our network learns local
features with limited receptive fields, hence it generalizes well to new shapes
and new datasets. We evaluate our neural MC approach by quantitative and
qualitative comparisons to all well-known MC variants. In particular, we
demonstrate the ability of our network to recover sharp features such as edges
and corners, a long-standing issue of MC and its variants. Our network also
reconstructs local mesh topologies more accurately than previous approaches.]]></summary>

symbolic AI on top of real-valued vectors \cite{Plate1995} by associating each

seen little use outside of older symbolic AI work and cognitive science. Our
goal is to revisit this approach to understand if it is viable for enabling a
hybrid neural-symbolic approach to learning as a differentiable component of a
deep learning architecture. HRRs today are not effective in a differentiable
solution due to numerical instability, a problem we solve by introducing a
projection step that forces the vectors to exist in a well behaved point in
space. In doing so we improve the concept retrieval efficacy of HRRs by over
$100\times$. Using multi-label classification we demonstrate how to leverage
the symbolic HRR properties to develop an output layer and loss function that
is able to learn effectively, and allows us to investigate some of the pros and

learning applications. RDF is supported by a rich ecosystem of data management
systems and tools, most notably RDF database systems that provide a SPARQL
query interface. Surprisingly, machine learning tools for knowledge graphs do
not use SPARQL, despite the obvious advantages of using a database system. This
is due to the mismatch between SPARQL and machine learning tools in terms of
data model and programming style. Machine learning tools work on data in
tabular format and process it using an imperative programming style, while
SPARQL is declarative and has as its basic operation matching graph patterns to
RDF triples. We posit that a good interface to knowledge graphs from a machine
learning software stack should use an imperative, navigational programming
paradigm based on graph traversal rather than the SPARQL query paradigm based
on graph patterns. In this paper, we present RDFFrames, a framework that
provides such an interface. RDFFrames provides an imperative Python API that
gets internally translated to SPARQL, and it is integrated with the PyData
machine learning software stack. RDFFrames enables the user to make a sequence
of Python calls to define the data to be extracted from a knowledge graph
stored in an RDF database system, and it translates these calls into a compact
SPQARL query, executes it on the database system, and returns the results in a
standard tabular format. Thus, RDFFrames is a useful tool for data preparation
that combines the usability of PyData with the flexibility and performance of
RDF database systems.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dry eye disease (DED) has a prevalence of between 5 and 50\%, depending on
the diagnostic criteria used and population under study. However, it remains
one of the most underdiagnosed and undertreated conditions in ophthalmology.
Many tests used in the diagnosis of DED rely on an experienced observer for
image interpretation, which may be considered subjective and result in
variation in diagnosis. Since artificial intelligence (AI) systems are capable
of advanced problem solving, use of such techniques could lead to more
objective diagnosis. Although the term `AI' is commonly used, recent success in
its applications to medicine is mainly due to advancements in the sub-field of
machine learning, which has been used to automatically classify images and
predict medical outcomes. Powerful machine learning techniques have been
harnessed to understand nuances in patient data and medical images, aiming for
consistent diagnosis and stratification of disease severity. This is the first
literature review on the use of AI in DED. We provide a brief introduction to
AI, report its current use in DED research and its potential for application in
the clinic. Our review found that AI has been employed in a wide range of DED
clinical tests and research applications, primarily for interpretation of
interferometry, slit-lamp and meibography images. While initial results are
promising, much work is still needed on model development, clinical testing and
standardisation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Masked language modeling (MLM), a self-supervised pretraining objective, is
widely used in natural language processing for learning text representations.
MLM trains a model to predict a random sample of input tokens that have been
replaced by a [MASK] placeholder in a multi-class setting over the entire
vocabulary. When pretraining, it is common to use alongside MLM other auxiliary
objectives on the token or sequence level to improve downstream performance
(e.g. next sentence prediction). However, no previous work so far has attempted
in examining whether other simpler linguistically intuitive or not objectives
can be used standalone as main pretraining objectives. In this paper, we
explore five simple pretraining objectives based on token-level classification
tasks as replacements of MLM. Empirical results on GLUE and SQuAD show that our
proposed methods achieve comparable or better performance to MLM using a
BERT-BASE architecture. We further validate our methods using smaller models,
showing that pretraining a model with 41% of the BERT-BASE's parameters,
BERT-MEDIUM results in only a 1% drop in GLUE scores with our best objective.]]></summary>

paradigm. FL entails some pressing needs for developing novel parameter

have been widely adopted in FL and the recently proposed SIGNSGD with majority

Stochastic-Sign SGD which utilizes novel stochastic-sign based gradient
compressors enabling the aforementioned properties in a unified framework. We
also present an error-feedback variant of the proposed Stochastic-Sign SGD

identify named entities from user queries as diverse surface form attribute
values and afterward transform them into formally canonical forms. Such a
problem consists of two phases: {named entity recognition (NER)} and {attribute
value normalization (AVN)}. However, existing works only focus on the NER phase
but neglect equally important AVN. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a
unified query attribute value extraction system in e-commerce search named
QUEACO, which involves both two phases. Moreover, by leveraging large-scale
weakly-labeled behavior data, we further improve the extraction performance
with less supervision cost. Specifically, for the NER phase, QUEACO adopts a
novel teacher-student network, where a teacher network that is trained on the
strongly-labeled data generates pseudo-labels to refine the weakly-labeled data
for training a student network. Meanwhile, the teacher network can be
dynamically adapted by the feedback of the student's performance on
strongly-labeled data to maximally denoise the noisy supervisions from the weak
labels. For the AVN phase, we also leverage the weakly-labeled
query-to-attribute behavior data to normalize surface form attribute values
from queries into canonical forms from products. Extensive experiments on a
real-world large-scale E-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
QUEACO.]]></summary>

learning architectures trained on multivariate time series signals. The
importance of the fixed-dimensional vector representation generated by the
single-head network has been demonstrated for industrial machinery condition
monitoring and predictive maintenance. However, processing heterogeneous sensor
signals with a single head may result in a model that cannot explicitly account
for the diversity in time-varying multivariate inputs. This work extends the
conventional single-head deep learning models to a more robust form by
developing context-specific heads to independently capture the inherent pattern
of each sensor reading in multivariate time series signals. Using the turbofan
aircraft engine benchmark dataset (CMAPSS), an extensive experiment is
performed to verify the effectiveness and benefits of multi-head fully
connected neurons, recurrent networks, convolution network, the
transformer-style stand-alone attention network, and their variants for
remaining useful life estimation. Moreover, the effect of different attention
mechanisms on the multi-head models is also evaluated. In addition, each
architecture's relative advantage and computational overhead are analyzed.
Results show that utilizing the attention layer is task-sensitive and
model-dependent, as it does not provide consistent improvement across the
models investigated. The result is further compared with five state-of-the-art
models, and the comparison shows that a relatively simple multi-head
architecture performs better than the state-of-the-art models. The results
presented in this study demonstrate the importance of multi-head models and
attention mechanisms to improved understanding of the remaining useful life of

diagnosis. Although previous attempts to classify sleep stages have achieved
high classification performance, several challenges remain open: 1) How to
effectively utilize time-varying spatial and temporal features from
multi-channel brain signals remains challenging. Prior works have not been able
to fully utilize the spatial topological information among brain regions. 2)
Due to the many differences found in individual biological signals, how to
overcome the differences of subjects and improve the generalization of deep
neural networks is important. 3) Most deep learning methods ignore the
interpretability of the model to the brain. To address the above challenges, we
propose a multi-view spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks (MSTGCN)
with domain generalization for sleep stage classification. Specifically, we
construct two brain view graphs for MSTGCN based on the functional connectivity
and physical distance proximity of the brain regions. The MSTGCN consists of
graph convolutions for extracting spatial features and temporal convolutions
for capturing the transition rules among sleep stages. In addition, attention
mechanism is employed for capturing the most relevant spatial-temporal
information for sleep stage classification. Finally, domain generalization and
MSTGCN are integrated into a unified framework to extract subject-invariant
sleep features. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that the

distributed fog nodes at the edge of the Internet, enabling compute-intensive
and latency-sensitive computing services for vehicles through task offloading.
However, a heterogeneous mobility environment introduces uncertainties in terms
of resource supply and demand, which are inevitable bottlenecks for the optimal
offloading decision. Also, these uncertainties bring extra challenges to task
offloading under the oblivious adversary attack and data privacy risks. In this
article, we develop a new adversarial online learning algorithm with bandit
feedback based on the adversarial multi-armed bandit theory, to enable scalable
and low-complexity offloading decision making. Specifically, we focus on
optimizing fog node selection with the aim of minimizing the offloading service
costs in terms of delay and energy. The key is to implicitly tune the
exploration bonus in the selection process and the assessment rules of the
designed algorithm, taking into account volatile resource supply and demand. We
theoretically prove that the input-size dependent selection rule allows to
choose a suitable fog node without exploring the sub-optimal actions, and also
an appropriate score patching rule allows to quickly adapt to evolving
circumstances, which reduce variance and bias simultaneously, thereby achieving
a better exploitation-exploration balance. Simulation results verify the

robustness of deep learning models against distribution shifts. However,
existing works focus on OoD algorithms, such as invariant risk minimization,
domain generalization, or stable learning, without considering the influence of
deep model architectures on OoD generalization, which may lead to sub-optimal
performance. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods search for architecture
based on its performance on the training data, which may result in poor
generalization for OoD tasks. In this work, we propose robust Neural
Architecture Search for OoD generalization (NAS-OoD), which optimizes the
architecture with respect to its performance on generated OoD data by gradient
descent. Specifically, a data generator is learned to synthesize OoD data by
maximizing losses computed by different neural architectures, while the goal
for architecture search is to find the optimal architecture parameters that
minimize the synthetic OoD data losses. The data generator and the neural
architecture are jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner, and the minimax
training process effectively discovers robust architectures that generalize
well for different distribution shifts. Extensive experimental results show
that NAS-OoD achieves superior performance on various OoD generalization
benchmarks with deep models having a much fewer number of parameters. In
addition, on a real industry dataset, the proposed NAS-OoD method reduces the

traditional cloud based approach that requires data upload may not be feasible

Specifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device

server for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the
communications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to
federated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework
does not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder
can be trained independently at each edge device without any server
involvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users' data is protected by
transmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption. Experimental
results provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the recent years, Federated machine learning continues to gain interest
and momentum where there is a need to draw insights from data while preserving
the data provider's privacy. However, one among other existing challenges in
the adoption of federated learning has been the lack of fair, transparent and
universally agreed incentivization schemes for rewarding the federated learning
contributors. Smart contracts on a blockchain network provide transparent,
immutable and independently verifiable proofs by all participants of the
network. We leverage this open and transparent nature of smart contracts on a
blockchain to define incentivization rules for the contributors, which is based
on a novel scalar quantity - federated contribution. Such a smart contract
based reward-driven model has the potential to revolutionize the federated
learning adoption in enterprises. Our contribution is two-fold: first is to
show how smart contract based blockchain can be a very natural communication
channel for federated learning. Second, leveraging this infrastructure, we can
show how an intuitive measure of each agents' contribution can be built and
integrated with the life cycle of the training and reward process.]]></summary>

multiple views of a shared context. Recent works intuitively apply contrastive
learning (CL) to learn representations, regarded as a pairwise manner, which is
still scalable: view-specific noise is not filtered in learning view-shared
representations; the fake negative pairs, where the negative terms are actually
within the same class as the positive, and the real negative pairs are
coequally treated; and evenly measuring the similarities between terms might
interfere with optimization. Importantly, few works research the theoretical
framework of generalized self-supervised multi-view learning, especially for
more than two views. To this end, we rethink the existing multi-view learning
paradigm from the information theoretical perspective and then propose a novel
information theoretical framework for generalized multi-view learning. Guided
by it, we build a multi-view coding method with a three-tier progressive
architecture, namely Information theory-guided heuristic Progressive Multi-view
Coding (IPMC). In the distribution-tier, IPMC aligns the distribution between
views to reduce view-specific noise. In the set-tier, IPMC builds self-adjusted
pools for contrasting, which utilizes a view filter to adaptively modify the
pools. Lastly, in the instance-tier, we adopt a designed unified loss to learn
discriminative representations and reduce the gradient interference.
Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate the superiority of IPMC over
state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is an emerging optical imaging
method providing multiplex molecular and functional information from the rodent
brain. It can be greatly augmented by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that
offers excellent soft-tissue contrast and high-resolution brain anatomy.
Nevertheless, registration of multi-modal images remains challenging, chiefly
due to the entirely different image contrast rendered by these modalities.
Previously reported registration algorithms mostly relied on manual
user-dependent brain segmentation, which compromised data interpretation and
accurate quantification. Here we propose a fully automated registration method
for MSOT-MRI multimodal imaging empowered by deep learning. The automated
workflow includes neural network-based image segmentation to generate suitable
masks, which are subsequently registered using an additional neural network.
Performance of the algorithm is showcased with datasets acquired by
cross-sectional MSOT and high-field MRI preclinical scanners. The automated
registration method is further validated with manual and half-automated
registration, demonstrating its robustness and accuracy.]]></summary>

queries. Most focus on interventional queries, such as the conditional average
treatment effect. However, as noted by Pearl, interventional queries only form
part of a larger hierarchy of causal queries, with counterfactuals sitting at
the top. Despite this, our community has not fully succeeded in adapting
machine learning tools to answer counterfactual queries. This work addresses
this challenge by showing how to implement twin network counterfactual
inference -- an alternative to abduction, action, & prediction counterfactual
inference -- with deep learning to estimate counterfactual queries. We show how
the graphical nature of twin networks makes them particularly amenable to deep
learning, yielding simple neural network architectures that, when trained, are
capable of counterfactual inference. Importantly, we show how to enforce known
identifiability constraints during training, ensuring the answer to each
counterfactual query is uniquely determined. We demonstrate our approach by
using it to accurately estimate the probabilities of causation -- important
counterfactual queries that quantify the degree to which one event was a
necessary or sufficient cause of another -- on both synthetic and real data.]]></summary>

that facilitates taking gradients of computer programs. While the corresponding
flexible gradient-based optimization approaches so far have been used
predominantly for deep learning or enriching the latter with modeling
components, we want to demonstrate that they can also be useful for statistical
modeling per se, e.g., for quick prototyping when classical maximum likelihood
approaches are challenging or not feasible. In an application from a COVID-19
setting, we utilize differentiable programming to quickly build and optimize a
flexible prediction model adapted to the data quality challenges at hand.
Specifically, we develop a regression model, inspired by delay differential
equations, that can bridge temporal gaps of observations in the central German
registry of COVID-19 intensive care cases for predicting future demand. With
this exemplary modeling challenge, we illustrate how differentiable programming
can enable simple gradient-based optimization of the model by automatic
differentiation. This allowed us to quickly prototype a model under time
pressure that outperforms simpler benchmark models. We thus exemplify the
potential of differentiable programming also outside deep learning
applications, to provide more options for flexible applied statistical
modeling.]]></summary>

key roles in the biology of microbes. As the most abundant biological entities
on the planet, the number of discovered phages is only the tip of the iceberg.
Recently, many new phages have been revealed using high throughput sequencing,
particularly metagenomic sequencing. Compared to the fast accumulation of
phage-like sequences, there is a serious lag in taxonomic classification of
phages. High diversity, abundance, and limited known phages pose great
challenges for taxonomic analysis. In particular, alignment-based tools have
difficulty in classifying fast accumulating contigs assembled from metagenomic
data. Results: In this work, we present a novel semi-supervised learning model,
named PhaGCN, to conduct taxonomic classification for phage contigs. In this
learning model, we construct a knowledge graph by combining the DNA sequence
features learned by convolutional neural network (CNN) and protein sequence
similarity gained from gene-sharing network. Then we apply graph convolutional
network (GCN) to utilize both the labeled and unlabeled samples in training to
enhance the learning ability. We tested PhaGCN on both simulated and real
sequencing data. The results clearly show that our method competes favorably
against available phage classification tools.]]></summary>

strings into quantum states. We propose a new method to embed discrete features
with trainable quantum circuits by combining QRAC and a recently proposed
strategy for training quantum feature map called quantum metric learning. We
show that the proposed trainable embedding requires not only as few qubits as

resulting weight-space ensembles provide large accuracy improvements
out-of-distribution, while matching or improving in-distribution accuracy. On
ImageNet and five derived distribution shifts, weight-space ensembles improve

devised for the statistical comparison of the performance of multiple
algorithms: scmamp, model confidence set, and superior predictive ability. Our
analysis highlights those models with the highest probability of being the best

when additional constraints are posed on the network or on its moralized graph.
More precisely, we consider the constraint that the network or its moralized
graph are close, in terms of vertex or edge deletions, to a sparse graph class
$\Pi$. For example, we show that learning an optimal network whose moralized
graph has vertex deletion distance at most $k$ from a graph with maximum degree
1 can be computed in polynomial time when $k$ is constant. This extends
previous work that gave an algorithm with such a running time for the vertex
deletion distance to edgeless graphs [Korhonen & Parviainen, NIPS 2015]. We
then show that further extensions or improvements are presumably impossible.
For example, we show that learning optimal networks where the network or its
moralized graph have maximum degree $2$ or connected components of size at most
$c$, $c\ge 3$, is NP-hard. Finally, we show that learning an optimal network
with at most $k$ edges in the moralized graph presumably has no $f(k)\cdot

most $k$ arcs can be computed in $2^{O(k)}\cdot |I|^{O(1)}$ time where $|I|$ is

challenges to current ensemble clustering research. To deal with the curse of
dimensionality, recently considerable efforts in ensemble clustering have been
made by means of different subspace-based techniques. However, besides the
emphasis on subspaces, rather limited attention has been paid to the potential
diversity in similarity/dissimilarity metrics. It remains a surprisingly open
problem in ensemble clustering how to create and aggregate a large population
of diversified metrics, and furthermore, how to jointly investigate the
multi-level diversity in the large populations of metrics, subspaces, and
clusters in a unified framework. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a
novel multidiversified ensemble clustering approach. In particular, we create a
large number of diversified metrics by randomizing a scaled exponential
similarity kernel, which are then coupled with random subspaces to form a large
set of metric-subspace pairs. Based on the similarity matrices derived from
these metric-subspace pairs, an ensemble of diversified base clusterings can
thereby be constructed. Further, an entropy-based criterion is utilized to
explore the cluster-wise diversity in ensembles, based on which three specific
ensemble clustering algorithms are presented by incorporating three types of
consensus functions. Extensive experiments are conducted on 30 high-dimensional
datasets, including 18 cancer gene expression datasets and 12 image/speech
datasets, which demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms over the
state-of-the-art. The source code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The problem of training with a small set of positive samples is known as
few-shot learning (FSL). It is widely known that traditional deep learning (DL)
algorithms usually show very good performance when trained with large datasets.
However, in many applications, it is not possible to obtain such a high number
of samples. In the image domain, typical FSL applications include those related
to face recognition. In the audio domain, music fraud or speaker recognition
can be clearly benefited from FSL methods. This paper deals with the
application of FSL to the detection of specific and intentional acoustic events
given by different types of sound alarms, such as door bells or fire alarms,
using a limited number of samples. These sounds typically occur in domestic
environments where many events corresponding to a wide variety of sound classes
take place. Therefore, the detection of such alarms in a practical scenario can
be considered an open-set recognition (OSR) problem. To address the lack of a
dedicated public dataset for audio FSL, researchers usually make modifications
on other available datasets. This paper is aimed at poviding the audio
recognition community with a carefully annotated dataset
(https://zenodo.org/record/3689288) for FSL in an OSR context comprised of 1360
clips from 34 classes divided into pattern sounds} and unwanted sounds. To
facilitate and promote research on this area, results with state-of-the-art
baseline systems based on transfer learning are also presented.]]></summary>

And though there are an increasing number of seemingly disparate methods, many
of them can be folded into one unifying regime: causal optimal transport. This
new method directly targets distributional balance by minimizing optimal
transport distances between treatment and control groups or, more generally,
between a source and target population. Our approach is model-free but can also
incorporate moments or any other important functions of covariates that the
researcher desires to balance. We find that the causal optimal transport
outperforms competitor methods when both the propensity score and outcome
models are misspecified, indicating it is a robust alternative to common
weighting methods. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our method in an
external control study examining the effect of misoprostol versus oxytocin for

referring to the past subsequence that is the closest to the current one. The
distance significance is introduced based on the online matrix profile, which
demonstrates a prominent pattern when an anomaly occurs. Another training-free
approach spectral residual is integrated into our approach to further enhance
the detection accuracy. Moreover, the proposed approach is sped up by at least
four times for long time series by the introduced cache strategy. In comparison
to the existing approaches, the online matrix profile makes a good trade-off

on randomly sampled targets, yet the same systems are later used to predict
user behavior sequentially from a fixed point in time. Simulating online
recommender system performance is notoriously difficult and the discrepancy
between online and offline behaviors is typically not accounted for in offline
evaluations. This disparity permits weaknesses to go unnoticed until the model
is deployed in a production setting. In this paper, we first demonstrate how
omitting temporal context when evaluating recommender system performance leads
to false confidence. To overcome this, we postulate that offline evaluation
protocols can only model real-life use-cases if they account for temporal
context. Next, we propose a training procedure to further embed the temporal
context in existing models. We use a multi-objective approach to introduce
temporal context into traditionally time-unaware recommender systems and
confirm its advantage via the proposed evaluation protocol. Finally, we
validate that the Pareto Fronts obtained with the added objective dominate
those produced by state-of-the-art models that are only optimized for accuracy
on three real-world publicly available datasets. The results show that
including our temporal objective can improve recall@20 by up to 20%.]]></summary>

vasculatures from fundus images help identify early signs of many crucial
illnesses such as diabetic retinopathy. Due to the varying shape, size, and
patterns of retinal vessels, along with artefacts and noises in fundus images,
no one-stage method can accurately segment retinal vessels. In this work, we
propose a multi-scale, multi-level attention embedded CNN architecture
((M)SLAe-Net) to address the issue of multi-stage processing for robust and
precise segmentation of retinal vessels. We do this by extracting features at
multiple scales and multiple levels of the network, enabling our model to
holistically extracts the local and global features. Multi-scale features are
extracted using our novel dynamic dilated pyramid pooling (D-DPP) module. We
also aggregate the features from all the network levels. These effectively
resolved the issues of varying shapes and artefacts and hence the need for
multiple stages. To assist in better pixel-level classification, we use the
Squeeze and Attention(SA) module, a smartly adapted version of the Squeeze and
Excitation(SE) module for segmentation tasks in our network to facilitate
pixel-group attention. Our unique network design and novel D-DPP module with
efficient task-specific loss function for thin vessels enabled our model for
better cross data performance. Exhaustive experimental results on DRIVE, STARE,
HRF, and CHASE-DB1 show the superiority of our method.]]></summary>

broader lens on fairness reveals that AI can serve a greater aspiration:
rooting out societal inequities from their source. Specifically, we focus on
inequities in health information, and aim to reduce bias in that domain using
AI. The AI algorithms under the hood of search engines and social media, many
of which are based on recommender systems, have an outsized impact on the
quality of medical and health information online. Therefore, embedding bias
detection and reduction into these recommender systems serving up medical and
health content online could have an outsized positive impact on patient
outcomes and wellbeing.

In this position paper, we offer the following contributions: (1) we propose
a novel framework of Fairness via AI, inspired by insights from medical
education, sociology and antiracism; (2) we define a new term, bisinformation,
which is related to, but distinct from, misinformation, and encourage
researchers to study it; (3) we propose using AI to study, detect and mitigate
biased, harmful, and/or false health information that disproportionately hurts
minority groups in society; and (4) we suggest several pillars and pose several
open problems in order to seed inquiry in this new space. While part (3) of
this work specifically focuses on the health domain, the fundamental computer
science advances and contributions stemming from research efforts in bias
reduction and Fairness via AI have broad implications in all areas of society.]]></summary>

expansion approximation of uniformity (BEAUTY) approach, which generalizes the
celebrated Euler's formula, and approximates the characteristic function of any

important tests through approximations from some quadratic forms of symmetry
statistics, where the deterministic weight matrix characterizes the power
properties of each test. To achieve a robust power, we study test statistics
with data-adaptive weights, referred to as the binary expansion adaptive
symmetry test (BEAST). By utilizing the properties of the binary expansion
filtration, we show that the Neyman-Pearson test of uniformity can be
approximated by an oracle weighted sum of symmetry statistics. The BEAST with
this oracle provides a benchmark of feasible power against any alternative by
leading all existing tests with a substantial margin. To approach this oracle
power, we develop the BEAST through a regularized resampling approximation of

analysis in a careful and modular way that allows for straightforward and

longitude, and compute the risk of each grid based on spatial and temporal
conditions. To verify the generalizability of our models, we further expand the

several possible methods on reducing the number of high risk wildfires. Taken

recognition rules are often learned based on various sources of information. On
the other hand, the recent deployment of facial recognition systems with uneven
predictive performances on different population segments highlights the
representativeness issues possibly induced by a naive aggregation of image
datasets. Indeed, sampling bias does not vanish simply by considering larger
datasets, and ignoring its impact may completely jeopardize the generalization
capacity of the learned prediction rules. In this paper, we show how biasing
models, originally introduced for nonparametric estimation in (Gill et al.,
1988), and recently revisited from the perspective of statistical learning
theory in (Laforgue and Cl\'emen\c{c}on, 2019), can be applied to remedy these
problems in the context of visual recognition. Based on the (approximate)
knowledge of the biasing mechanisms at work, our approach consists in
reweighting the observations, so as to form a nearly debiased estimator of the
target distribution. One key condition for our method to be theoretically valid
is that the supports of the distributions generating the biased datasets at
disposal must overlap, and cover the support of the target distribution. In
order to meet this requirement in practice, we propose to use a low dimensional
image representation, shared across the image databases. Finally, we provide
numerical experiments highlighting the relevance of our approach whenever the
biasing functions are appropriately chosen.]]></summary>

enables decision-making under uncertainty. Classifier design aims at building
models from training data for representing feature-label distributions--either
explicitly or implicitly. In many scientific or clinical settings, training
data are typically limited, which makes designing accurate classifiers and
evaluating their classification error extremely challenging. While transfer
learning (TL) can alleviate this issue by incorporating data from relevant
source domains to improve learning in a different target domain, it has
received little attention for performance assessment, notably in error
estimation. In this paper, we fill this gap by investigating knowledge
transferability in the context of classification error estimation within a
Bayesian paradigm. We introduce a novel class of Bayesian minimum mean-square
error (MMSE) estimators for optimal Bayesian transfer learning (OBTL), which
enables rigorous evaluation of classification error under uncertainty in a
small-sample setting. Using Monte Carlo importance sampling, we employ the
proposed estimator to evaluate the classification accuracy of a broad family of
classifiers that span diverse learning capabilities. Experimental results based
on both synthetic data as well as real-world RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data show
that our proposed OBTL error estimation scheme clearly outperforms standard
error estimators, especially in a small-sample setting, by tapping into the

tasks. As they rapidly evolve, their escalating computation and memory demands
make it challenging to deploy them on resource-constrained edge devices. Though
extensive efficient accelerator designs, from traditional electronics to
emerging photonics, have been successfully demonstrated, they are still
bottlenecked by expensive memory accesses due to tremendous gaps between the
bandwidth/power/latency of electrical memory and computing cores. Previous
solutions fail to fully-leverage the ultra-fast computational speed of emerging
DNN accelerators to break through the critical memory bound. In this work, we
propose a general and unified framework to trade expensive memory transactions
with ultra-fast on-chip computations, directly translating to performance
improvement. We are the first to jointly explore the intrinsic correlations and
bit-level redundancy within DNN kernels and propose a multi-level in situ
generation mechanism with mixed-precision bases to achieve on-the-fly recovery
of high-resolution parameters with minimum hardware overhead. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our proposed joint method can boost the memory
efficiency by 10-20x with comparable accuracy over four state-of-the-art
designs, when benchmarked on ResNet-18/DenseNet-121/MobileNetV2/V3 with various
tasks.]]></summary>

applications. However, it is difficult to tell beforehand if a DNN receiving an
input will deliver the correct output since their decision criteria are usually
nontransparent. A DNN delivers the correct output if the input is within the
area enclosed by its generalization envelope. In this case, the information
contained in the input sample is processed reasonably by the network. It is of
large practical importance to assess at inference time if a DNN generalizes
correctly. Currently, the approaches to achieve this goal are investigated in
different problem set-ups rather independently from one another, leading to
three main research and literature fields: predictive uncertainty,
out-of-distribution detection and adversarial example detection. This survey
connects the three fields within the larger framework of investigating the
generalization performance of machine learning methods and in particular DNNs.
We underline the common ground, point at the most promising approaches and give
a structured overview of the methods that provide at inference time means to
establish if the current input is within the generalization envelope of a DNN.]]></summary>

affected by this paradigm shift. The huge amount of data to be processed under
this new paradigm will be a major concern in the future and one will strongly
require cloud based services in all the aspects of these computations (from

science has heavily impacted or rather triggered the emergence of Machine
Learning, Signal/Image/Video processing related algorithms, Artificial
intelligence, Robotics, health informatics, geoinformatics, and many more such
areas of interest. Hence, we envisage an era where Data science can deliver its
promises with the help of the existing cloud based platforms and services with
the addition of new services. In this article, we discuss about data driven
science and Machine learning and how they are going to be linked through cloud

allowed. In this setting, many methods directly attack surrogate models and
transfer the obtained adversarial examples to fool the target model. Plenty of
previous works investigated what kind of attacks to the surrogate model can
generate more transferable adversarial examples, but their performances are
still limited due to the mismatches between surrogate models and the target
model. In this paper, we tackle this problem from a novel angle -- instead of
using the original surrogate models, can we obtain a Meta-Surrogate Model (MSM)
such that attacks to this model can be easier transferred to other models? We
show that this goal can be mathematically formulated as a well-posed
(bi-level-like) optimization problem and design a differentiable attacker to
make training feasible. Given one or a set of surrogate models, our method can
thus obtain an MSM such that adversarial examples generated on MSM enjoy
eximious transferability. Comprehensive experiments on Cifar-10 and ImageNet
demonstrate that by attacking the MSM, we can obtain stronger transferable
adversarial examples to fool black-box models including adversarially trained
ones, with much higher success rates than existing methods. The proposed method
reveals significant security challenges of deep models and is promising to be
served as a state-of-the-art benchmark for evaluating the robustness of deep
models in the black-box setting.]]></summary>

in distribution to the training data. In an ideal case, Deep Learning models
would achieve Out-of-Distribution (OoD) Generalization, i.e. reliably make
predictions on out-of-distribution data. Yet in practice, models usually fail
to generalize well when facing a shift in distribution. Several methods were
thereby designed to improve the robustness of the features learned by a model
through Regularization- or Domain-Prediction-based schemes. Segmenting medical
images such as MRIs of the hippocampus is essential for the diagnosis and
treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. But these brain images often suffer
from distribution shift due to the patient's age and various pathologies
affecting the shape of the organ. In this work, we evaluate OoD Generalization
solutions for the problem of hippocampus segmentation in MR data using both
fully- and semi-supervised training. We find that no method performs reliably
in all experiments. Only the V-REx loss stands out as it remains easy to tune,

data mining and learning tasks. GRL aims to capture the graph's structural
information and exploit it in combination with node and edge attributes to
compute low-dimensional representations. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
have been used in state-of-the-art GRL architectures, they have been shown to
suffer from over smoothing when many GNN layers need to be stacked. In a
different GRL approach, spectral methods based on graph filtering have emerged
addressing over smoothing; however, up to now, they employ traditional neural
networks that cannot efficiently exploit the structure of graph data. Motivated
by this, we propose PointSpectrum, a spectral method that incorporates a set
equivariant network to account for a graph's structure. PointSpectrum enhances
the efficiency and expressiveness of spectral methods, while it outperforms or
competes with state-of-the-art GRL methods. Overall, PointSpectrum addresses
over smoothing by employing a graph filter and captures a graph's structure
through set equivariance, lying on the intersection of GNNs and spectral
methods. Our findings are promising for the benefits and applicability of this
architectural shift for spectral methods and GRL.]]></summary>

correlation clustering) problem, a classical graph clustering problem widely

violated inequalities of the underlying multicut relaxation, (2) Performing
message passing between the edges and cycles to optimize the Lagrange
relaxation coming from the found violated cycles producing reduced costs and
(3) Contracting edges with high reduced costs through matrix-matrix
multiplications.

Our algorithm produces primal solutions and dual lower bounds that estimate
the distance to optimum. We implement our algorithm on GPUs and show resulting
one to two order-of-magnitudes improvements in execution speed without
sacrificing solution quality compared to traditional serial algorithms that run

parameters. In addition, Byzantine faults including software, hardware, network
issues occur in distributed systems which also lead to a negative impact on the

defends adversarial attacks and/or tolerates Byzantine faults. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our algorithm under three common adversarial attacks again

that using ParSGD, ML models can still produce accurate predictions as if it is

to the new reality, where people may wear surgical masks to cover their noses
and mouths. Traditional data sets (e.g., CelebA, CASIA-WebFace) used for
training these systems were released before the pandemic, so they now seem
unsuited due to the lack of examples of people wearing masks. We propose a
method for enhancing data sets containing faces without masks by creating
synthetic masks and overlaying them on faces in the original images. Our method
relies on Spark AR Studio, a developer program made by Facebook that is used to
create Instagram face filters. In our approach, we use 9 masks of different
colors, shapes and fabrics. We employ our method to generate a number of
445,446 (90%) samples of masks for the CASIA-WebFace data set and 196,254
(96.8%) masks for the CelebA data set, releasing the mask images at
https://github.com/securifai/masked_faces. We show that our method produces
significantly more realistic training examples of masks overlaid on faces by
asking volunteers to qualitatively compare it to other methods or data sets
designed for the same task. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our method by
evaluating state-of-the-art face recognition systems (FaceNet, VGG-face,

equivalent systems trained on the original data sets (containing faces without
masks), when the test benchmark contains masked faces.]]></summary>

problem not only because of different distributions of each stream but also
because of rapidly changing and never-ending environments of data streams.
Albeit growing research achievements in this area, most of existing works are
developed for a single source domain which limits its resilience to exploit
multi-source domains being beneficial to recover from concept drifts quickly
and to avoid the negative transfer problem. An online domain adaptation
technique under multisource streaming processes, namely automatic online
multi-source domain adaptation (AOMSDA), is proposed in this paper. The online
domain adaptation strategy of AOMSDA is formulated under a coupled generative
and discriminative approach of denoising autoencoder (DAE) where the central
moment discrepancy (CMD)-based regularizer is integrated to handle the
existence of multi-source domains thereby taking advantage of complementary
information sources. The asynchronous concept drifts taking place at different
time periods are addressed by a self-organizing structure and a node
re-weighting strategy. Our numerical study demonstrates that AOMSDA is capable
of outperforming its counterparts in 5 of 8 study cases while the ablation
study depicts the advantage of each learning component. In addition, AOMSDA is

Individuals with COVID-19 may show multiple symptoms such as cough, fever, and
shortness of breath. Many of the existing detection techniques focus on
symptoms having the same equal importance. However, it has been shown that some
symptoms are more prevalent than others. In this paper, we present a multimodal

using convolutional neural networks and our novel probability-based weighting
function that considers the prevalence of each symptom. The experiments were

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are one of the most widely used
generative models. GANs can learn complex multi-modal distributions, and
generate real-like samples. Despite the major success of GANs in generating
synthetic data, they might suffer from unstable training process, and mode
collapse. In this paper, we introduce a new GAN architecture called variance
enforcing GAN (VARGAN), which incorporates a third network to introduce
diversity in the generated samples. The third network measures the diversity of
the generated samples, which is used to penalize the generator's loss for low
diversity samples. The network is trained on the available training data and
undesired distributions with limited modality. On a set of synthetic and
real-world image data, VARGAN generates a more diverse set of samples compared
to the recent state-of-the-art models. High diversity and low computational
complexity, as well as fast convergence, make VARGAN a promising model to
alleviate mode collapse.]]></summary>

is possible to achieve high levels of compression with surprisingly little
degradation to test set accuracy. However, this measure of performance conceals
significant differences in how different classes and images are impacted by
model compression techniques. We find that models with radically different
numbers of weights have comparable top-line performance metrics but diverge
considerably in behavior on a narrow subset of the dataset. This small subset
of data points, which we term Pruning Identified Exemplars (PIEs) are
systematically more impacted by the introduction of sparsity. Compression
disproportionately impacts model performance on the underrepresented long-tail
of the data distribution. PIEs over-index on atypical or noisy images that are
far more challenging for both humans and algorithms to classify. Our work
provides intuition into the role of capacity in deep neural networks and the
trade-offs incurred by compression. An understanding of this disparate impact
is critical given the widespread deployment of compressed models in the wild.]]></summary>

activation functions. For general continuous $f$ defined on $[0,1]^d$ with
continuity modulus $\omega_f(\cdot)$, we construct ReLU-sine-$2^x$ networks
that enjoy an approximation rate
$\mathcal{O}(\omega_f(\sqrt{d})\cdot2^{-M}+\omega_{f}\left(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{N}\right))$,
where $M,N\in \mathbb{N}^{+}$ denote the hyperparameters related to widths of
the networks. As a consequence, we can construct ReLU-sine-$2^x$ network with
the depth $5$ and width
$\max\left\{\left\lceil2d^{3/2}\left(\frac{3\mu}{\epsilon}\right)^{1/{\alpha}}\right\rceil,2\left\lceil\log_2\frac{3\mu

\mathcal{H}_{\mu}^{\alpha}([0,1]^d)$ within a given tolerance $\epsilon >0$

$\mathcal{H}_{\mu}^{\alpha}([0,1]^d)$ denotes the H\"older continuous function

(generalized) differentiable, enabling us to apply SGD to train.]]></summary>

the criteria derived from disentangled statistical spaces (known as
Re-projected Adjusted-Standardized Residual Vector Spaces, notated as RARV). It
outperformed methods using other criteria (i.e. support and confidence) popular
as reported in the literature. Association results showed that PDD can
discover: i) a smaller set of succinct significant associations in clusters;
ii) frequent and rare, yet significant, patterns supported by population health

it more practical in real-world tasks, but its relatively poor scalability and
the partially observable constraints raise challenges to its performance and
deployment. Based on our intuitive observation that the human society could be
regarded as a large-scale partially observable environment, where each
individual has the function of communicating with neighbors and remembering its
own experience, we propose a novel network structure called hierarchical graph
recurrent network(HGRN) for multi-agent cooperation under partial
observability. Specifically, we construct the multi-agent system as a graph,
use the hierarchical graph attention network(HGAT) to achieve communication
between neighboring agents, and exploit GRU to enable agents to record
historical information. To encourage exploration and improve robustness, we
design a maximum-entropy learning method to learn stochastic policies of a
configurable target action entropy. Based on the above technologies, we
proposed a value-based MADRL algorithm called Soft-HGRN and its actor-critic
variant named SAC-HRGN. Experimental results based on three homogeneous tasks
and one heterogeneous environment not only show that our approach achieves
clear improvements compared with four baselines, but also demonstrates the
interpretability, scalability, and transferability of the proposed model.
Ablation studies prove the function and necessity of each component.]]></summary>

information needs; attempts to address these needs have caused an information

(NLP), the branch of artificial intelligence that interprets human language,
can be applied to address many of the information needs made urgent by the

than 50 systems and datasets addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We detail work
on four core NLP tasks: information retrieval, named entity recognition,
literature-based discovery, and question answering. We also describe work that
directly addresses aspects of the pandemic through four additional tasks: topic
modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, caseload forecasting, and
misinformation detection. We conclude by discussing observable trends and
remaining challenges.]]></summary>

labeled training data, such as in the medical domain. Language models have
emerged as the prevalent choice of several natural language tasks due to the
performance boost offered by these models. However, in several domains, such as
medicine, the scarcity of labeled training data is a common issue. Also, these
models may not work well in cases where class imbalance is prevalent. Active
learning may prove helpful in these cases to boost the performance with a
limited label budget. To this end, we propose a novel method using sampling
techniques based on submodular optimization and optimal transport for active
learning in language models, dubbed ALLWAS. We construct a sampling strategy
based on submodular optimization of the designed objective in the gradient
domain. Furthermore, to enable learning from few samples, we propose a novel
strategy for sampling from the Wasserstein barycenters. Our empirical
evaluations on standard benchmark datasets for text classification show that
our methods perform significantly better (>20% relative increase in some cases)

approach for health data analysis, especially for computational phenotyping,
where the high-dimensional Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with patients
history of medical procedures, medications, diagnosis, lab tests, etc., are
converted to meaningful and interpretable medical concepts. Federated tensor
factorization distributes the tensor computation to multiple workers under the
coordination of a central server, which enables jointly learning the phenotypes
across multiple hospitals while preserving the privacy of the patient
information. However, existing federated tensor factorization algorithms
encounter the single-point-failure issue with the involvement of the central
server, which is not only easily exposed to external attacks, but also limits
the number of clients sharing information with the server under restricted
uplink bandwidth. In this paper, we propose CiderTF, a communication-efficient
decentralized generalized tensor factorization, which reduces the uplink
communication cost by leveraging a four-level communication reduction strategy
designed for a generalized tensor factorization, which has the flexibility of
modeling different tensor distribution with multiple kinds of loss functions.
Experiments on two real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that CiderTF achieves
comparable convergence with the communication reduction up to 99.99%.]]></summary>

this paper, the random GCN is introduced for which a random matrix theory

perturbed, or in the extreme case random, then the GCN fails to benefit from
the node features. It is furthermore observed that enhancing the message

of the graph structure solves this problem. An empirical study of a GCN
utilised for node classification on six real datasets further confirms the
theoretical findings and demonstrates that perturbations of the graph structure
can result in GCNs performing significantly worse than Multi-Layer Perceptrons
run on the node features alone. In practice, adding a node feature kernel to
the message passing of perturbed graphs results in a significant improvement of
the GCN's performance, thereby rendering it more robust to graph perturbations.

and low-power operation. Its linear unit performs a multiplication of an input
vector and a weight matrix in optical analog circuits. Among them, a circuit
with a multiple-layered structure of programmable Mach-Zehnder interferometers
(MZIs) can realize a specific class of unitary matrices with a limited number

learn MZI parameters of the circuit with a conventional automatic
differentiation (AD), which machine learning platforms are equipped with. To
solve the time-consuming problem, we propose an acceleration method for
learning MZI parameters. We create customized complex-valued derivatives for an
MZI, exploiting Wirtinger derivatives and a chain rule. They are incorporated
into our newly developed function module implemented in C++ to collectively
calculate their values in a multi-layered structure. Our method is simple,
fast, and versatile as well as compatible with the conventional AD. We
demonstrate that our method works 20 times faster than the conventional AD when

develop AI services at the edge of 6G wireless networks as it supports
collaborative model training at a massive number of mobile devices. However,
model communication over wireless channels, especially in uplink model
uploading of FEEL, has been widely recognized as a bottleneck that critically
limits the efficiency of FEEL. Although over-the-air computation can alleviate
the excessive cost of radio resources in FEEL model uploading, practical
implementations of over-the-air FEEL still suffer from several challenges,
including strong straggler issues, large communication overheads, and potential
privacy leakage. In this article, we study these challenges in over-the-air
FEEL and leverage reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), a key enabler of
future wireless systems, to address these challenges. We study the
state-of-the-art solutions on RIS-empowered FEEL and explore the promising
research opportunities for adopting RIS to enhance FEEL performance.]]></summary>

increasing interest for their ability to perform fast approximation of
effective hydrodynamic parameters in porous media research and applications.
This paper presents a novel methodology for permeability prediction from
micro-CT scans of geological rock samples. The training data set for CNNs
dedicated to permeability prediction consists of permeability labels that are
typically generated by classical lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) that simulate
the flow through the pore space of the segmented image data. We instead perform
direct numerical simulation (DNS) by solving the stationary Stokes equation in
an efficient and distributed-parallel manner. As such, we circumvent the
convergence issues of LBM that frequently are observed on complex pore
geometries, and therefore, improve on the generality and accuracy of our
training data set. Using the DNS-computed permeabilities, a physics-informed
CNN PhyCNN) is trained by additionally providing a tailored characteristic
quantity of the pore space. More precisely, by exploiting the connection to
flow problems on a graph representation of the pore space, additional
information about confined structures is provided to the network in terms of
the maximum flow value, which is the key innovative component of our workflow.
As a result, unprecedented prediction accuracy and robustness are observed for
a variety of sandstone samples from archetypal rock formations.]]></summary>

function between two random variables, correntropy has been successfully
applied in robust machine learning and signal processing to combat large
outliers. The kernel function in correntropy is usually a zero-mean Gaussian
kernel. In a recent work, the concept of mixture correntropy (MC) was proposed
to improve the learning performance, where the kernel function is a mixture
Gaussian kernel, namely a linear combination of several zero-mean Gaussian
kernels with different widths. In both correntropy and mixture correntropy, the
center of the kernel function is, however, always located at zero. In the
present work, to further improve the learning performance, we propose the
concept of multi-kernel correntropy (MKC), in which each component of the
mixture Gaussian kernel can be centered at a different location. The properties
of the MKC are investigated and an efficient approach is proposed to determine
the free parameters in MKC. Experimental results show that the learning
algorithms under the maximum multi-kernel correntropy criterion (MMKCC) can
outperform those under the original maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) and the
maximum mixture correntropy criterion (MMCC).]]></summary>

segmentation from both MRI and CT scans. More specifically, the proposed model
consists of a 3D encoder that learns to extract volume features at different
scales; features taken at different points of the encoder hierarchy are then
sent to multiple 3D decoders that individually predict intermediate
segmentation maps. Finally, all segmentation maps are combined to obtain a
unique detailed segmentation mask. We test our model on both CT and MRI imaging
data: the publicly available NIH Pancreas-CT dataset (consisting of 82
contrast-enhanced CTs) and a private MRI dataset (consisting of 40 MRI scans).
Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing methods on CT
pancreas segmentation, obtaining an average Dice score of about 88%, and yields
promising segmentation performance on a very challenging MRI data set (average
Dice score is about 77%). Additional control experiments demonstrate that the
achieved performance is due to the combination of our 3D fully-convolutional
deep network and the hierarchical representation decoding, thus substantiating
our architectural design.]]></summary>

square-integrable variables in $\mathbb{R}^d$, with common expectation $\mu$
and covariance matrix $\Sigma$, both unknown. We consider the problem of
testing if $\mu$ is $\eta$-close to zero, i.e. $\|\mu\| \leq \eta $ against
$\|\mu\| \geq (\eta + \delta)$; we also tackle the more general two-sample mean
closeness testing problem. The aim of this paper is to obtain nonasymptotic
upper and lower bounds on the minimal separation distance $\delta$ such that we
can control both the Type I and Type II errors at a given level. The main
technical tools are concentration inequalities, first for a suitable estimator
of $\|\mu\|^2$ used a test statistic, and secondly for estimating the operator
and Frobenius norms of $\Sigma$ coming into the quantiles of said test
statistic. These properties are obtained for Gaussian and bounded
distributions. A particular attention is given to the dependence in the
pseudo-dimension $d_*$ of the distribution, defined as $d_* :=
\|\Sigma\|_2^2/\|\Sigma\|_\infty^2$. In particular, for $\eta=0$, the minimum
separation distance is ${\Theta}(d_*^{\frac{1}{4}}\sqrt{\|\Sigma\|_\infty/n})$,
in contrast with the minimax estimation distance for $\mu$, which is
${\Theta}(d_e^{\frac{1}{2}}\sqrt{\|\Sigma\|_\infty/n})$ (where
$d_e:=\|\Sigma\|_1/\|\Sigma\|_\infty$). This generalizes a phenomenon spelled

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vision-and-language (V\&L) reasoning necessitates perception of visual
concepts such as objects and actions, understanding semantics and language
grounding, and reasoning about the interplay between the two modalities. One
crucial aspect of visual reasoning is spatial understanding, which involves
understanding relative locations of objects, i.e.\ implicitly learning the
geometry of the scene. In this work, we evaluate the faithfulness of V\&L
models to such geometric understanding, by formulating the prediction of
pair-wise relative locations of objects as a classification as well as a
regression task. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art transformer-based
V\&L models lack sufficient abilities to excel at this task. Motivated by this,
we design two objectives as proxies for 3D spatial reasoning (SR) -- object
centroid estimation, and relative position estimation, and train V\&L with weak
supervision from off-the-shelf depth estimators. This leads to considerable
improvements in accuracy for the "GQA" visual question answering challenge (in
fully supervised, few-shot, and O.O.D settings) as well as improvements in
relative spatial reasoning. Code and data will be released

and is usually performed using crowd motion algorithms for which appropriate
parameter values need to be found. The study of the relation between parametric
values for simulation techniques and the quality of the resulting trajectories
has been studied either through perceptual experiments or by comparison with
real crowd trajectories. In this paper, we integrate both strategies. A quality
metric, QF, is proposed to abstract from reference data while capturing the
most salient features that affect the perception of trajectory realism. QF
weights and combines cost functions that are based on several individual, local
and global properties of trajectories. These trajectory features are selected
from the literature and from interviews with experts. To validate the capacity
of QF to capture perceived trajectory quality, we conduct an online experiment
that demonstrates the high agreement between the automatic quality score and
non-expert users. To further demonstrate the usefulness of QF, we use it in a
data-free parameter tuning application able to tune any parametric microscopic
crowd simulation model that outputs independent trajectories for characters.
The learnt parameters for the tuned crowd motion model maintain the influence
of the reference data which was used to weight the terms of QF.]]></summary>

generalization ability of neural networks. The companion baseline Transformers,
typically trained with default hyper-parameters from standard tasks, are shown
to fail dramatically. Here we demonstrate that by revisiting model
configurations as basic as scaling of embeddings, early stopping, relative
positional embedding, and Universal Transformer variants, we can drastically
improve the performance of Transformers on systematic generalization. We report
improvements on five popular datasets: SCAN, CFQ, PCFG, COGS, and Mathematics
dataset. Our models improve accuracy from 50% to 85% on the PCFG productivity
split, and from 35% to 81% on COGS. On SCAN, relative positional embedding
largely mitigates the EOS decision problem (Newman et al., 2020), yielding 100%
accuracy on the length split with a cutoff at 26. Importantly, performance
differences between these models are typically invisible on the IID data split.
This calls for proper generalization validation sets for developing neural
networks that generalize systematically. We publicly release the code to
reproduce our results.]]></summary>

partially observed systems. Our framework is based on the fundamental notion of
information state. We provide two equivalent definitions of information state
-- i) a function of history which is sufficient to compute the expected reward
and predict its next value; ii) equivalently, a function of the history which
can be recursively updated and is sufficient to compute the expected reward and
predict the next observation. An information state always leads to a dynamic
programming decomposition. Our key result is to show that if a function of the
history (called approximate information state (AIS)) approximately satisfies
the properties of the information state, then there is a corresponding
approximate dynamic program. We show that the policy computed using this is
approximately optimal with bounded loss of optimality. We show that several
approximations in state, observation and action spaces in literature can be
viewed as instances of AIS. In some of these cases, we obtain tighter bounds. A
salient feature of AIS is that it can be learnt from data. We present AIS based
multi-time scale policy gradient algorithms. and detailed numerical experiments

the complexity of previously developed basic models. However, it is unclear
whether there is a way to boost performance by decreasing the complexity of
such models. Here, based on an optimization method, we investigate the
feasibility of improving graph classification performance while simplifying the
model learning process. Inspired by progress in structural information
assessment, we optimize the given data sample from graphs to encoding trees. In
particular, we minimize the structural entropy of the transformed encoding tree
to decode the key structure underlying a graph. This transformation is denoted
as structural optimization. Furthermore, we propose a novel feature combination
scheme, termed hierarchical reporting, for encoding trees. In this scheme,
features are transferred from leaf nodes to root nodes by following the
hierarchical structures of encoding trees. We then present an implementation of
the scheme in a tree kernel and a convolutional network to perform graph
classification. The tree kernel follows label propagation in the
Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) subtree kernel, but it has a lower runtime complexity
$O(n)$. The convolutional network is a special implementation of our tree
kernel in the deep learning field and is called Encoding Tree Learning (ETL).
We empirically validate our tree kernel and convolutional network with several
graph classification benchmarks and demonstrate that our methods achieve better
performance and lower computational consumption than competing approaches.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using only a model that was trained to predict where people look at images,
and no additional training data, we can produce a range of powerful editing
effects for reducing distraction in images. Given an image and a mask
specifying the region to edit, we backpropagate through a state-of-the-art
saliency model to parameterize a differentiable editing operator, such that the
saliency within the masked region is reduced. We demonstrate several operators,
including: a recoloring operator, which learns to apply a color transform that
camouflages and blends distractors into their surroundings; a warping operator,
which warps less salient image regions to cover distractors, gradually
collapsing objects into themselves and effectively removing them (an effect
akin to inpainting); a GAN operator, which uses a semantic prior to fully
replace image regions with plausible, less salient alternatives. The resulting
effects are consistent with cognitive research on the human visual system
(e.g., since color mismatch is salient, the recoloring operator learns to
harmonize objects' colors with their surrounding to reduce their saliency),
and, importantly, are all achieved solely through the guidance of the
pretrained saliency model, with no additional supervision. We present results
on a variety of natural images and conduct a perceptual study to evaluate and
validate the changes in viewers' eye-gaze between the original images and our
edited results.]]></summary>

individual students as they go through online courses. This student performance
(SP) modeling problem, also known as knowledge tracing, is a critical step for
building adaptive online teaching systems. Specifically, we conduct a study of
how to utilize various types and large amounts of students log data to train
accurate machine learning models that predict the knowledge state of future
students. This study is the first to use four very large datasets made
available recently from four distinct intelligent tutoring systems. Our results
include a new machine learning approach that defines a new state of the art for
SP modeling, improving over earlier methods in several ways: First, we achieve
improved accuracy by introducing new features that can be easily computed from
conventional question-response logs (e.g., the pattern in the student's most
recent answers). Second, we take advantage of features of the student history
that go beyond question-response pairs (e.g., which video segments the student
watched, or skipped) as well as information about prerequisite structure in the
curriculum. Third, we train multiple specialized modeling models for different
aspects of the curriculum (e.g., specializing in early versus later segments of
the student history), then combine these specialized models to create a group
prediction of student knowledge. Taken together, these innovations yield an
average AUC score across these four datasets of 0.807 compared to the previous
best logistic regression approach score of 0.766, and also outperforming
state-of-the-art deep neural net approaches. Importantly, we observe consistent
improvements from each of our three methodological innovations, in each
dataset, suggesting that our methods are of general utility and likely to
produce improvements for other online tutoring systems as well.]]></summary>

long-tail problem, mainly in object classification tasks. In this paper, we
make the first large-scale study concerning the task of Long-Tail Visual
Relationship Recognition (LTVRR). LTVRR aims at improving the learning of
structured visual relationships that come from the long-tail (e.g., "rabbit
grazing on grass"). In this setup, the subject, relation, and object classes
each follow a long-tail distribution. To begin our study and make a future
benchmark for the community, we introduce two LTVRR-related benchmarks, dubbed
VG8K-LT and GQA-LT, built upon the widely used Visual Genome and GQA datasets.
We use these benchmarks to study the performance of several state-of-the-art
long-tail models on the LTVRR setup. Lastly, we propose a visiolinguistic
hubless (VilHub) loss and a Mixup augmentation technique adapted to LTVRR
setup, dubbed as RelMix. Both VilHub and RelMix can be easily integrated on top
of existing models and despite being simple, our results show that they can
remarkably improve the performance, especially on tail classes. Benchmarks,

automated fashion. The best general AI algorithm designed by one individual is
different from that devised by another. The best performance records achieved
by different users are also different. An inevitable component of general AI is
tacit knowledge that depends upon user-specific comprehension of task
information and individual model design preferences that are related to user
technical experiences. Tacit knowledge affects model performance but cannot be
automatically optimized in general AI algorithms. In this paper, we propose
User-Oriented Smart General AI System under Causal Inference, abbreviated as
UOGASuCI, where UOGAS represents User-Oriented General AI System and uCI means
under the framework of causal inference. User characteristics that have a
significant influence upon tacit knowledge can be extracted from observed model
training experiences of many users in external memory modules. Under the
framework of causal inference, we manage to identify the optimal value of user
characteristics that are connected with the best model performance designed by
users. We make suggestions to users about how different user characteristics
can improve the best model performance achieved by users. By recommending
updating user characteristics associated with individualized tacit knowledge
comprehension and technical preferences, UOGAS helps users design models with

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Autonomous vehicles must reason about spatial occlusions in urban
environments to ensure safety without being overly cautious. Prior work
explored occlusion inference from observed social behaviors of road agents.
Inferring occupancy from agent behaviors is an inherently multimodal problem; a
driver may behave in the same manner for different occupancy patterns ahead of
them (e.g., a driver may move at constant speed in traffic or on an open road).
Past work, however, does not account for this multimodality, thus neglecting to
model this source of aleatoric uncertainty in the relationship between driver
behaviors and their environment. We propose an occlusion inference method that
characterizes observed behaviors of human agents as sensor measurements, and
fuses them with those from a standard sensor suite. To capture the aleatoric
uncertainty, we train a conditional variational autoencoder with a discrete
latent space to learn a multimodal mapping from observed driver trajectories to
an occupancy grid representation of the view ahead of the driver. Our method
handles multi-agent scenarios, combining measurements from multiple observed
drivers using evidential theory to solve the sensor fusion problem. Our
approach is validated on a real-world dataset, outperforming baselines and
demonstrating real-time capable performance. Our code is available at

models using image-level annotations. Despite of the success of previous works,
explorations on an effective training strategy for the saliency network and
accurate matches between image-level annotations and salient objects are still
inadequate. In this work, 1) we propose a self-calibrated training strategy by
explicitly establishing a mutual calibration loop between pseudo labels and
network predictions, liberating the saliency network from error-prone
propagation caused by pseudo labels. 2) we prove that even a much smaller
dataset (merely 1.8% of ImageNet) with well-matched annotations can facilitate
models to achieve better performance as well as generalizability. This sheds
new light on the development of WSOD and encourages more contributions to the
community. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
all the existing WSOD methods by adopting the self-calibrated strategy only.
Steady improvements are further achieved by training on the proposed dataset.
Additionally, our method achieves 94.7% of the performance of fully-supervised
methods on average. And what is more, the fully supervised models adopting our
predicted results as "ground truths" achieve successful results (95.6% for
BASNet and 97.3% for ITSD on F-measure), while costing only 0.32% of labeling
time for pixel-level annotation.]]></summary>

networks has been a fruitful source of improvement in machine learning. Adding
auxiliary losses to the main objective function is a general way of encoding
biases that can help networks learn better representations. However, since
auxiliary losses are minimized only on training data, they suffer from the same
generalization gap as regular task losses. Moreover, by adding a term to the
loss function, the model optimizes a different objective than the one we care
about. In this work we address both problems: first, we take inspiration from
\textit{transductive learning} and note that after receiving an input but
before making a prediction, we can fine-tune our networks on any unsupervised
loss. We call this process {\em tailoring}, because we customize the model to
each input to ensure our prediction satisfies the inductive bias. Second, we
formulate {\em meta-tailoring}, a nested optimization similar to that in
meta-learning, and train our models to perform well on the task objective after
adapting them using an unsupervised loss. The advantages of tailoring and
meta-tailoring are discussed theoretically and demonstrated empirically on a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Glioma is a common malignant brain tumor that shows distinct survival among
patients. The isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene mutation status provides
critical diagnostic and prognostic value for glioma and is now accepted as the
standard of care. A non-invasive prediction of IDH mutation based on the
pre-treatment MRI has crucial clinical significance. Machine learning and deep
learning models show reasonable performance in predicting IDH mutation status.
However, most models neglect the systematic brain alterations caused by tumor
invasion, where the infiltration along white matter tracts throughout the brain
is identified as a hallmark of glioma. Structural brain network provides an
effective tool to characterise brain organisation, which could be captured by
the graph neural networks (GNN) for a more accurate prediction of IDH mutation
status.

Here we propose a method to predict the IDH mutation using GNN, based on the
structural brain network of patients. Specifically, we firstly construct a
network template of healthy subjects, which consists of atlases of edges (white
matter tracts) and nodes (cortical and subcortical brain regions) to provide
regions of interest (ROI). Next, we employ autoencoders to extract the latent
multi-modal MRI features from the ROIs of the edge and node in patients. These
features of edge and node of brain networks are used to train a GNN
architecture in predicting IDH mutation status. The results show that the
proposed method outperforms the baseline models using 3D-CNN and 3D-DenseNet.
In addition, the model interpretation suggests its ability to identify the
tracts infiltrated by tumor and corresponds to clinical prior knowledge. In
conclusion, integrating brain networks with GNN offers a new avenue to study
brain lesions using computational neuroscience and computer vision approaches.]]></summary>

to act using only supervised learning techniques. Unlike traditional
algorithms, UDRL does not use reward prediction or search for an optimal
policy. Instead, it trains agents to follow commands such as "obtain so much
total reward in so much time." Many of its general principles are outlined in a
companion report; the goal of this paper is to develop a practical learning
algorithm and show that this conceptually simple perspective on agent training
can produce a range of rewarding behaviors for multiple episodic environments.
Experiments show that on some tasks UDRL's performance can be surprisingly
competitive with, and even exceed that of some traditional baseline algorithms
developed over decades of research. Based on these results, we suggest that
alternative approaches to expected reward maximization have an important role

traditional cloud based approach that requires data upload may not be feasible
due to communication bandwidth limitation as well as privacy and security
concerns of end users. To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving
edge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.
Specifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device
individually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge
server for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the
communications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to
federated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework
does not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder
can be trained independently at each edge device without any server
involvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users' data is protected by
transmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption. Experimental
results provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various
design parameters such as the data compression ratio of the autoencoder and the
model complexity.]]></summary>

networks has been a fruitful source of improvement in machine learning. Adding
auxiliary losses to the main objective function is a general way of encoding
biases that can help networks learn better representations. However, since
auxiliary losses are minimized only on training data, they suffer from the same
generalization gap as regular task losses. Moreover, by adding a term to the
loss function, the model optimizes a different objective than the one we care
about. In this work we address both problems: first, we take inspiration from
\textit{transductive learning} and note that after receiving an input but
before making a prediction, we can fine-tune our networks on any unsupervised
loss. We call this process {\em tailoring}, because we customize the model to
each input to ensure our prediction satisfies the inductive bias. Second, we
formulate {\em meta-tailoring}, a nested optimization similar to that in
meta-learning, and train our models to perform well on the task objective after
adapting them using an unsupervised loss. The advantages of tailoring and
meta-tailoring are discussed theoretically and demonstrated empirically on a
diverse set of examples.]]></summary>

pretraining. In the cross-modal setting, tokens in the sentence are masked at
random, and the model predicts the masked tokens given the image and the text.
In this paper, we observe several key disadvantages of MLM in this setting.
First, as captions tend to be short, in a third of the sentences no token is
sampled. Second, the majority of masked tokens are stop-words and punctuation,
leading to under-utilization of the image. We investigate a range of
alternative masking strategies specific to the cross-modal setting that address
these shortcomings, aiming for better fusion of text and image in the learned
representation. When pre-training the LXMERT model, our alternative masking
strategies consistently improve over the original masking strategy on three
downstream tasks, especially in low resource settings. Further, our
pre-training approach substantially outperforms the baseline model on a
prompt-based probing task designed to elicit image objects. These results and
our analysis indicate that our method allows for better utilization of the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Segmenting each moving object instance in a scene is essential for many
applications. But like many other computer vision tasks, this task performs
well in optimal weather, but then adverse weather tends to fail. To be robust
in weather conditions, the usual way is to train network in data of given
weather pattern or to fuse multiple sensors. We focus on a new possibility,
that is, to improve its resilience to weather interference through the
network's structural design. First, we propose a novel FPN structure called
RiWFPN with a progressive top-down interaction and attention refinement module.
RiWFPN can directly replace other FPN structures to improve the robustness of
the network in non-optimal weather conditions. Then we extend SOLOV2 to capture
temporal information in video to learn motion information, and propose a moving
object instance segmentation network with RiWFPN called RiWNet. Finally, in
order to verify the effect of moving instance segmentation in different weather
disturbances, we propose a VKTTI-moving dataset which is a moving instance
segmentation dataset based on the VKTTI dataset, taking into account different
weather scenes such as rain, fog, sunset, morning as well as overcast. The
experiment proves how RiWFPN improves the network's resilience to adverse
weather effects compared to other FPN structures. We compare RiWNet to several
other state-of-the-art methods in some challenging datasets, and RiWNet shows
better performance especially under adverse weather conditions.]]></summary>

using deep learning technologies, its misuse is a well-known issue now.
Deepfakes can cause severe security and privacy issues as they can be used to
impersonate a person's identity in a video by replacing his/her face with
another person's face. Recently, a new problem of generating synthesized human
voice of a person is emerging, where AI-based deep learning models can
synthesize any person's voice requiring just a few seconds of audio. With the
emerging threat of impersonation attacks using deepfake audios and videos, a
new generation of deepfake detectors is needed to focus on both video and audio
collectively. A large amount of good quality datasets is typically required to
capture the real-world scenarios to develop a competent deepfake detector.
Existing deepfake datasets either contain deepfake videos or audios, which are
racially biased as well. Hence, there is a crucial need for creating a good
video as well as an audio deepfake dataset, which can be used to detect audio
and video deepfake simultaneously. To fill this gap, we propose a novel
Audio-Video Deepfake dataset (FakeAVCeleb) that contains not only deepfake
videos but also respective synthesized lip-synced fake audios. We generate this
dataset using the current most popular deepfake generation methods. We selected
real YouTube videos of celebrities with four racial backgrounds (Caucasian,
Black, East Asian, and South Asian) to develop a more realistic multimodal
dataset that addresses racial bias and further help develop multimodal deepfake
detectors. We performed several experiments using state-of-the-art detection
methods to evaluate our deepfake dataset and demonstrate the challenges and
usefulness of our multimodal Audio-Video deepfake dataset.]]></summary>

To support learning from pre-recorded logs, we assume that the world is on
rails, meaning neither the agent nor its actions influence the environment.
This assumption greatly simplifies the learning problem, factorizing the
dynamics into a nonreactive world model and a low-dimensional and compact
forward model of the ego-vehicle. Our approach computes action-values for each
training trajectory using a tabular dynamic-programming evaluation of the
Bellman equations; these action-values in turn supervise the final vision-based
driving policy. Despite the world-on-rails assumption, the final driving policy
acts well in a dynamic and reactive world. At the time of writing, our method
ranks first on the CARLA leaderboard, attaining a 25% higher driving score
while using 40 times less data. Our method is also an order of magnitude more

applications. Over the last few years, the methods based on convolution neural
networks have made substantial progress. However, because of the large variety
of object scales, densities, and arbitrary orientations, the current detectors
struggle with the extraction of semantically strong features for small-scale
objects by a predefined convolution kernel. To address this problem, we propose
the rotation equivariant feature image pyramid network (REFIPN), an image
pyramid network based on rotation equivariance convolution. The proposed model
adopts single-shot detector in parallel with a lightweight image pyramid module
to extract representative features and generate regions of interest in an
optimization approach. The proposed network extracts feature in a wide range of
scales and orientations by using novel convolution filters. These features are
used to generate vector fields and determine the weight and angle of the
highest-scoring orientation for all spatial locations on an image. By this
approach, the performance for small-sized object detection is enhanced without
sacrificing the performance for large-sized object detection. The performance
of the proposed model is validated on two commonly used aerial benchmarks and
the results show our proposed model can achieve state-of-the-art performance
with satisfactory efficiency.]]></summary>

tremendous amount of work in detecting coughs from audio but there has been no
effort to identify coughs from solely inertial measurement unit (IMU). Coughing
causes motion across the whole body and especially on the neck and head.
Therefore, head motion data during coughing captured by a head-worn IMU sensor
could be leveraged to detect coughs using a template matching algorithm. In
time series template matching problems, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) combined with
elastic distance measurement (esp. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)) achieves
outstanding performance. However, it is often regarded as prohibitively
time-consuming. Nearest Centroid Classifier is thereafter proposed. But the
accuracy is comprised of only one centroid obtained for each class.
Centroid-based Classifier performs clustering and averaging for each cluster,
but requires manually setting the number of clusters. We propose a novel
self-tuning multi-centroid template-matching algorithm, which can automatically
adjust the number of clusters to balance accuracy and inference time. Through
experiments conducted on synthetic datasets and a real-world earbud-based cough
dataset, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm and present

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Network quantization, which aims to reduce the bit-lengths of the network
weights and activations, has emerged for their deployments to resource-limited
devices. Although recent studies have successfully discretized a full-precision
network, they still incur large quantization errors after training, thus giving
rise to a significant performance gap between a full-precision network and its
quantized counterpart. In this work, we propose a novel quantization method for
neural networks, Cluster-Promoting Quantization (CPQ) that finds the optimal
quantization grids while naturally encouraging the underlying full-precision
weights to gather around those quantization grids cohesively during training.
This property of CPQ is thanks to our two main ingredients that enable
differentiable quantization: i) the use of the categorical distribution
designed by a specific probabilistic parametrization in the forward pass and
ii) our proposed multi-class straight-through estimator (STE) in the backward
pass. Since our second component, multi-class STE, is intrinsically biased, we
additionally propose a new bit-drop technique, DropBits, that revises the
standard dropout regularization to randomly drop bits instead of neurons. As a
natural extension of DropBits, we further introduce the way of learning
heterogeneous quantization levels to find proper bit-length for each layer by
imposing an additional regularization on DropBits. We experimentally validate
our method on various benchmark datasets and network architectures, and also
support a new hypothesis for quantization: learning heterogeneous quantization
levels outperforms the case using the same but fixed quantization levels from

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The optic nerve head represents the intraocular section of the optic nerve
(ONH), which is prone to damage by intraocular pressure. The advent of optical
coherence tomography (OCT) has enabled the evaluation of novel optic nerve head
parameters, namely the depth and curvature of the lamina cribrosa (LC).
Together with the Bruch's membrane opening minimum-rim-width, these seem to be
promising optic nerve head parameters for diagnosis and monitoring of retinal
diseases such as glaucoma. Nonetheless, these optical coherence tomography
derived biomarkers are mostly extracted through manual segmentation, which is
time-consuming and prone to bias, thus limiting their usability in clinical
practice. The automatic segmentation of optic nerve head in OCT scans could
further improve the current clinical management of glaucoma and other diseases.

This review summarizes the current state-of-the-art in automatic segmentation
of the ONH in OCT. PubMed and Scopus were used to perform a systematic review.
Additional works from other databases (IEEE, Google Scholar and ARVO IOVS) were
also included, resulting in a total of 27 reviewed studies.

For each algorithm, the methods, the size and type of dataset used for
validation, and the respective results were carefully analyzed. The results
show that deep learning-based algorithms provide the highest accuracy,
sensitivity and specificity for segmenting the different structures of the ONH
including the LC. However, a lack of consensus regarding the definition of
segmented regions, extracted parameters and validation approaches has been
observed, highlighting the importance and need of standardized methodologies
for ONH segmentation.]]></summary>

applicability to classical datasets (cifar10 and MNIST) as well. The approach

a crucial step for cardiac morphology and function analysis. However, automatic
RV segmentation from MRI is still challenging, mainly due to the heterogeneous
intensity, the complex variable shapes, and the unclear RV boundary. Moreover,
current methods for the RV segmentation tend to suffer from performance
degradation at the basal and apical slices of MRI. In this work, we propose an
automatic RV segmentation framework, where the information from long-axis (LA)
views is utilized to assist the segmentation of short-axis (SA) views via
information transition. Specifically, we employed the transformed segmentation
from LA views as a prior information, to extract the ROI from SA views for
better segmentation. The information transition aims to remove the surrounding
ambiguous regions in the SA views. %, such as the tricuspid valve regions. We
tested our model on a public dataset with 360 multi-center, multi-vendor and
multi-disease subjects that consist of both LA and SA MRIs. Our experimental
results show that including LA views can be effective to improve the accuracy
of the SA segmentation. Our model is publicly available at

indispensable strategy to speed up training large-scale Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs). However, existing sampling methods are mostly based on the graph
structural information and ignore the dynamicity of optimization, which leads
to high variance in estimating the stochastic gradients. The high variance
issue can be very pronounced in extremely large graphs, where it results in
slow convergence and poor generalization. In this paper, we theoretically
analyze the variance of sampling methods and show that, due to the composite
structure of empirical risk, the variance of any sampling method can be
decomposed into \textit{embedding approximation variance} in the forward stage
and \textit{stochastic gradient variance} in the backward stage that
necessities mitigating both types of variance to obtain faster convergence
rate. We propose a decoupled variance reduction strategy that employs
(approximate) gradient information to adaptively sample nodes with minimal
variance, and explicitly reduces the variance introduced by embedding
approximation. We show theoretically and empirically that the proposed method,
even with smaller mini-batch sizes, enjoys a faster convergence rate and
entails a better generalization compared to the existing methods.]]></summary>

explanation that deduces not only the important features of an input space but
also how those features should be modified to classify input as a target class
has gained an increasing interest. The patterns that deep networks have learned
from a training dataset can be grasped by observing the feature variation among
various classes. However, current approaches perform the feature modification
to increase the classification probability for the target class irrespective of
the internal characteristics of deep networks. This often leads to unclear
explanations that deviate from real-world data distributions. To address this
problem, we propose a counterfactual explanation method that exploits the
statistics learned from a training dataset. Especially, we gradually construct
an explanation by iterating over masking and composition steps. The masking
step aims to select an important feature from the input data to be classified
as a target class. Meanwhile, the composition step aims to optimize the
previously selected feature by ensuring that its output score is close to the
logit space of the training data that are classified as the target class.
Experimental results show that our method produces human-friendly
interpretations on various classification datasets and verify that such
interpretations can be achieved with fewer feature modification.]]></summary>

is possible to achieve high levels of compression with surprisingly little
degradation to test set accuracy. However, this measure of performance conceals
significant differences in how different classes and images are impacted by

numbers of weights have comparable top-line performance metrics but diverge
considerably in behavior on a narrow subset of the dataset. This small subset
of data points, which we term Pruning Identified Exemplars (PIEs) are
systematically more impacted by the introduction of sparsity. Compression
disproportionately impacts model performance on the underrepresented long-tail
of the data distribution. PIEs over-index on atypical or noisy images that are
far more challenging for both humans and algorithms to classify. Our work
provides intuition into the role of capacity in deep neural networks and the
trade-offs incurred by compression. An understanding of this disparate impact
is critical given the widespread deployment of compressed models in the wild.]]></summary>

processing on near-term quantum computers, aka QNLP. The language-modelling
framework we employ is that of compositional distributional semantics

pregroup grammars. Within this model, the grammatical reduction of a sentence
is interpreted as a diagram, encoding a specific interaction of words according
to the grammar. It is this interaction which, together with a specific choice
of word embedding, realises the meaning (or "semantics") of a sentence.
Building on the formal quantum-like nature of such interactions, we present a
method for mapping DisCoCat diagrams to quantum circuits. Our methodology is
compatible both with NISQ devices and with established Quantum Machine Learning
techniques, paving the way to near-term applications of quantum technology to

between pairs of columns of a table. Generally, RE models for this task require
labelled tables for training. These labelled tables can also be generated
artificially from a Knowledge Graph (KG), which makes the cost to acquire them
much lower in comparison to manual annotations. However, unlike real tables,
these synthetic tables lack associated metadata, such as, column-headers,

not store such metadata. Meanwhile, previous works have shown that metadata is
important for accurate RE from tables. To address this issue, we propose
methods to artificially create some of this metadata for synthetic tables.
Afterward, we experiment with a BERT-based model, in line with recently
published works, that takes as input a combination of proposed artificial
metadata and table content. Our empirical results show that this leads to an

heuristically ranking the features by importance and selecting the top few, or
by performing a full backward feature elimination routine. On-the-fly feature
selection methods proposed previously scale suboptimally with the number of
features, which can be daunting in high dimensional settings. We develop a
scalable forward feature selection variant for GBDT, via a novel group testing

performance and computational guarantees. We show via extensive experiments on
both public and proprietary datasets that the proposed method offers
significant speedups in training time, while being as competitive as existing
GBDT methods in terms of model performance metrics. We also extend the method
to the multitask setting, allowing the practitioner to select common features
across tasks, as well as selecting task-specific features.]]></summary>

open web acquire systemic biases, prejudices, and harmful views from their
training data. We present a methodology for programmatically identifying and
removing harmful text from web-scale datasets. A pretrained language model is
used to calculate the log-likelihood of researcher-written trigger phrases
conditioned on a specific document, which is used to identify and filter
documents from the dataset. We demonstrate that models trained on this filtered
dataset exhibit lower propensity to generate harmful text, with a marginal
decrease in performance on standard language modeling benchmarks compared to
unfiltered baselines. We provide a partial explanation for this performance gap
by surfacing examples of hate speech and other undesirable content from
standard language modeling benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the generalization
of this method and how trigger phrases which reflect specific values can be
used by researchers to build language models which are more closely aligned

its readability. It is essential desirable for outputs from text generation
systems like summarization, question answering, machine translation, question
generation, table-to-text, etc. An automated coherence scoring model is also
helpful in essay scoring or providing writing feedback. A large body of
previous work has leveraged entity-based methods, syntactic patterns, discourse
relations, and more recently traditional deep learning architectures for text
coherence assessment. Previous work suffers from drawbacks like the inability
to handle long-range dependencies, out-of-vocabulary words, or model sequence
information. We hypothesize that coherence assessment is a cognitively complex
task that requires deeper models and can benefit from other related tasks.
Accordingly, in this paper, we propose four different Transformer-based
architectures for the task: vanilla Transformer, hierarchical Transformer,
multi-task learning-based model, and a model with fact-based input
representation. Our experiments with popular benchmark datasets across multiple
domains on four different coherence assessment tasks demonstrate that our
models achieve state-of-the-art results outperforming existing models by a good
margin.]]></summary>

defense methods against various adversarial attacks. To our knowledge, existing
AT-based methods usually train with the locally most adversarial perturbed
points and treat all the perturbed points equally, which may lead to
considerably weaker adversarial robust generalization on test data. In this
work, we introduce a new adversarial training framework that considers the
diversity as well as characteristics of the perturbed points in the vicinity of
benign samples. To realize the framework, we propose a Regional Adversarial
Training (RAT) defense method that first utilizes the attack path generated by
the typical iterative attack method of projected gradient descent (PGD), and
constructs an adversarial region based on the attack path. Then, RAT samples
diverse perturbed training points efficiently inside this region, and utilizes
a distance-aware label smoothing mechanism to capture our intuition that
perturbed points at different locations should have different impact on the
model performance. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show
that RAT consistently makes significant improvement on standard adversarial
training (SAT), and exhibits better robust generalization.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SARS-CoV-2, like any other virus, continues to mutate as it spreads,
according to an evolutionary process. Unlike any other virus, the number of
currently available sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in public databases such as GISAID
is already several million. This amount of data has the potential to uncover
the evolutionary dynamics of a virus like never before. However, a million is
already several orders of magnitude beyond what can be processed by the
traditional methods designed to reconstruct a virus's evolutionary history,
such as those that build a phylogenetic tree. Hence, new and scalable methods
will need to be devised in order to make use of the ever increasing number of
viral sequences being collected.

Since identifying variants is an important part of understanding the
evolution of a virus, in this paper, we propose an approach based on clustering
sequences to identify the current major SARS-CoV-2 variants. Using a $k$-mer
based feature vector generation and efficient feature selection methods, our
approach is effective in identifying variants, as well as being efficient and
scalable to millions of sequences. Such a clustering method allows us to show
the relative proportion of each variant over time, giving the rate of spread of
each variant in different locations -- something which is important for vaccine
development and distribution. We also compute the importance of each amino acid
position of the spike protein in identifying a given variant in terms of
information gain. Positions of high variant-specific importance tend to agree
with those reported by the USA's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), further demonstrating our approach.]]></summary>

(DGP) regression. We construct the DGP by hierarchically putting transformed
Gaussian process (GP) priors on the length scales and magnitudes of the next
level of Gaussian processes in the hierarchy. The idea of the state-space
approach is to represent the DGP as a non-linear hierarchical system of linear
stochastic differential equations (SDEs), where each SDE corresponds to a
conditional GP. The DGP regression problem then becomes a state estimation
problem, and we can estimate the state efficiently with sequential methods by
using the Markov property of the state-space DGP. The computational complexity
scales linearly with respect to the number of measurements. Based on this, we
formulate state-space MAP as well as Bayesian filtering and smoothing solutions
to the DGP regression problem. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed
models and methods on synthetic non-stationary signals and apply the
state-space DGP to detection of the gravitational waves from LIGO measurements.]]></summary>

demand prediction and utilize the model further to define a generalized index
to measure quality of fire service in urban settings. Our model is built upon
spatial data collected from multiple different sources. Efficacy of proper
facility planning depends on choice of candidates where fire stations can be
located along with existing stations, if any. Also, the travel time from these
candidates to demand locations need to be taken care of to maintain fire safety
standard. Here, we propose a travel time based clustering technique to identify
suitable candidates. Finally, we develop an optimization problem to select best
locations to install new fire stations. Our optimization problem is built upon
maximum coverage problem, based on integer programming. We present a detailed
experimental study of our proposed approach in collaboration with city of

tackling several problems in computer vision, computer-aided diagnosis, and
related fields. While prior studies have focused on boosting the model
accuracy, quantifying the reproducibility of the most discriminative features
identified by GNNs is still an intact problem that yields concerns about their
reliability in clinical applications in particular. Specifically, the
reproducibility of biological markers across clinical datasets and distribution
shifts across classes (e.g., healthy and disordered brains) is of paramount
importance in revealing the underpinning mechanisms of diseases as well as
propelling the development of personalized treatment. Motivated by these
issues, we propose, for the first time, reproducibility-based GNN selection
(RG-Select), a framework for GNN reproducibility assessment via the
quantification of the most discriminative features (i.e., biomarkers) shared
between different models. To ascertain the soundness of our framework, the
reproducibility assessment embraces variations of different factors such as
training strategies and data perturbations. Despite these challenges, our
framework successfully yielded replicable conclusions across different training
strategies and various clinical datasets. Our findings could thus pave the way
for the development of biomarker trustworthiness and reliability assessment
methods for computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis tasks. RG-Select code is
available on GitHub at https://github.com/basiralab/RG-Select.]]></summary>

computational solutions that are both effective and efficient. A common
approach is to represent data objects as binary vectors, denoted \textit{hash
codes}, which require little storage and enable efficient similarity search
through direct indexing into a hash table or through similarity computations in
an appropriate space. Due to the limited expressibility of hash codes, compared
to real-valued representations, a core open challenge is how to generate hash
codes that well capture semantic content or latent properties using a small
number of bits, while ensuring that the hash codes are distributed in a way
that does not reduce their search efficiency. State of the art methods use
representation learning for generating such hash codes, focusing on neural
autoencoder architectures where semantics are encoded into the hash codes by
learning to reconstruct the original inputs of the hash codes. This thesis
addresses the above challenge and makes a number of contributions to
representation learning that (i) improve effectiveness of hash codes through
more expressive representations and a more effective similarity measure than
the current state of the art, namely the Hamming distance, and (ii) improve
efficiency of hash codes by learning representations that are especially suited
to the choice of search method. The contributions are empirically validated on
several tasks related to similarity search and recommendation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purpose: Echocardiography is commonly used as a non-invasive imaging tool in
clinical practice for the assessment of cardiac function. However, delineation
of the left ventricle is challenging due to the inherent properties of
ultrasound imaging, such as the presence of speckle noise and the low
signal-to-noise ratio. Methods: We propose a semi-automated segmentation
algorithm for the delineation of the left ventricle in temporal 3D
echocardiography sequences. The method requires minimal user interaction and
relies on a diffeomorphic registration approach. Advantages of the method
include no dependence on prior geometrical information, training data, or
registration from an atlas. Results: The method was evaluated using
three-dimensional ultrasound scan sequences from 18 patients from the
Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, Edmonton, Canada, and compared to manual
delineations provided by an expert cardiologist and four other registration
algorithms. The segmentation approach yielded the following results over the
cardiac cycle: a mean absolute difference of 1.01 (0.21) mm, a Hausdorff
distance of 4.41 (1.43) mm, and a Dice overlap score of 0.93 (0.02).
Conclusions: The method performed well compared to the four other registration
algorithms.]]></summary>

of key importance and relevance to a real-world setting. For question answering
(QA), the current state-of-the-art pre-trained models typically need
fine-tuning on tens of thousands of examples to obtain good results. Their
performance degrades significantly in a few-shot setting (< 100 examples). To
address this, we propose a simple fine-tuning framework that leverages
pre-trained text-to-text models and is directly aligned with their pre-training
framework. Specifically, we construct the input as a concatenation of the
question, a mask token representing the answer span and a context. Given this
input, the model is fine-tuned using the same objective as that of its
pre-training objective. Through experimental studies on various few-shot
configurations, we show that this formulation leads to significant gains on
multiple QA benchmarks (an absolute gain of 34.2 F1 points on average when
there are only 16 training examples). The gains extend further when used with
larger models (Eg:- 72.3 F1 on SQuAD using BART-large with only 32 examples)
and translate well to a multilingual setting . On the multilingual TydiQA
benchmark, our model outperforms the XLM-Roberta-large by an absolute margin of
upto 40 F1 points and an average of 33 F1 points in a few-shot setting (<= 64
training examples). We conduct detailed ablation studies to analyze factors
contributing to these gains.]]></summary>

automotive perception, to trigger a safe fallback mode. NNs often rely on
softmax normalization for confidence estimation, which can lead to high
confidences being assigned to OOD samples, thus hindering the detection of

pretraining. In the cross-modal setting, tokens in the sentence are masked at
random, and the model predicts the masked tokens given the image and the text.
In this paper, we observe several key disadvantages of MLM in this setting.
First, as captions tend to be short, in a third of the sentences no token is
sampled. Second, the majority of masked tokens are stop-words and punctuation,
leading to under-utilization of the image. We investigate a range of
alternative masking strategies specific to the cross-modal setting that address
these shortcomings, aiming for better fusion of text and image in the learned
representation. When pre-training the LXMERT model, our alternative masking
strategies consistently improve over the original masking strategy on three
downstream tasks, especially in low resource settings. Further, our
pre-training approach substantially outperforms the baseline model on a
prompt-based probing task designed to elicit image objects. These results and
our analysis indicate that our method allows for better utilization of the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We propose CX-ToM, short for counterfactual explanations with theory-of mind,
a new explainable AI (XAI) framework for explaining decisions made by a deep
convolutional neural network (CNN). In contrast to the current methods in XAI
that generate explanations as a single shot response, we pose explanation as an
iterative communication process, i.e. dialog, between the machine and human
user. More concretely, our CX-ToM framework generates sequence of explanations
in a dialog by mediating the differences between the minds of machine and human
user. To do this, we use Theory of Mind (ToM) which helps us in explicitly
modeling human's intention, machine's mind as inferred by the human as well as
human's mind as inferred by the machine. Moreover, most state-of-the-art XAI
frameworks provide attention (or heat map) based explanations. In our work, we
show that these attention based explanations are not sufficient for increasing
human trust in the underlying CNN model. In CX-ToM, we instead use
counterfactual explanations called fault-lines which we define as follows:
given an input image I for which a CNN classification model M predicts class
c_pred, a fault-line identifies the minimal semantic-level features (e.g.,
stripes on zebra, pointed ears of dog), referred to as explainable concepts,
that need to be added to or deleted from I in order to alter the classification
category of I by M to another specified class c_alt. We argue that, due to the
iterative, conceptual and counterfactual nature of CX-ToM explanations, our
framework is practical and more natural for both expert and non-expert users to
understand the internal workings of complex deep learning models. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments verify our hypotheses, demonstrating
that our CX-ToM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art explainable AI
models.]]></summary>

is to represent the input with a shared pre-trained language model, and add a

the behaviour of non-target heads, that is, the output of heads when given
input that belongs to a different task than the one they were trained for. We
find that non-target heads exhibit emergent behaviour, which may either explain
the target task, or generalize beyond their original task. For example, in a
numerical reasoning task, a span extraction head extracts from the input the
arguments to a computation that results in a number generated by a target
generative head. In addition, a summarization head that is trained with a
target question answering head, outputs query-based summaries when given a
question and a context from which the answer is to be extracted. This emergent
behaviour suggests that multi-task training leads to non-trivial extrapolation

roots/soil or due to increased transpiration. These factors adversely affect
plant physiology and photosynthetic ability to the extent that it has been
shown to have inhibitory effects in both growth and yield [18]. Early
identification of plant water stress status enables suitable corrective
measures to be applied to obtain the expected crop yield. Further, improving
crop yield through precision agriculture methods is a key component of climate
policy and the UN sustainable development goals [1]. Leaf water content (LWC)
is a measure that can be used to estimate water content and identify stressed
plants. LWC during the early crop growth stages is an important indicator of
plant productivity and yield. The effect of water stress can be instantaneous
[15], affecting gaseous exchange or long-term, significantly reducing [9, 18,
22]. It is thus necessary to identify potential plant water stress during the
early stages of growth [15] to introduce corrective irrigation and alleviate
stress. LWC is also useful for identifying plant genotypes that are tolerant to

estimate LWC from UAV-based hyperspectral data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In federated learning (FL), reducing the communication overhead is one of the
most critical challenges since the parameter server and the mobile devices
share the training parameters over wireless links. With such consideration, we
adopt the idea of SignSGD in which only the signs of the gradients are
exchanged. Moreover, most of the existing works assume Channel State
Information (CSI) available at both the mobile devices and the parameter
server, and thus the mobile devices can adopt fixed transmission rates dictated
by the channel capacity. In this work, only the parameter server side CSI is
assumed, and channel capacity with outage is considered. In this case, an
essential problem for the mobile devices is to select appropriate local
processing and communication parameters (including the transmission rates) to
achieve a desired balance between the overall learning performance and their
energy consumption. Two optimization problems are formulated and solved, which
optimize the learning performance given the energy consumption requirement, and
vice versa. Furthermore, considering that the data may be distributed across
the mobile devices in a highly uneven fashion in FL, a stochastic sign-based
algorithm is proposed. Extensive simulations are performed to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Targets are essential in problems such as object tracking in cluttered or
textureless environments, camera (and multi-sensor) calibration tasks, and
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Target shapes for these tasks
typically are symmetric (square, rectangular, or circular) and work well for
structured, dense sensor data such as pixel arrays (i.e., image). However,
symmetric shapes lead to pose ambiguity when using sparse sensor data such as
LiDAR point clouds and suffer from the quantization uncertainty of the LiDAR.
This paper introduces the concept of optimizing target shape to remove pose
ambiguity for LiDAR point clouds. A target is designed to induce large
gradients at edge points under rotation and translation relative to the LiDAR
to ameliorate the quantization uncertainty associated with point cloud
sparseness. Moreover, given a target shape, we present a means that leverages
the target's geometry to estimate the target's vertices while globally
estimating the pose. Both the simulation and the experimental results (verified
by a motion capture system) confirm that by using the optimal shape and the
global solver, we achieve centimeter error in translation and a few degrees in
rotation even when a partially illuminated target is placed 30 meters away. All
the implementations and datasets are available at

mixed-integer programming (MIP) problems. Proper selection of cuts would remove
infeasible solutions in the early stage, thus largely reducing the
computational burden without hurting the solution accuracy. However, the major
cut selection approaches heavily rely on heuristics, which strongly depend on
the specific problem at hand and thus limit their generalization capability. In
this paper, we propose a data-driven and generalizable cut selection approach,
named Cut Ranking, in the settings of multiple instance learning. To measure
the quality of the candidate cuts, a scoring function, which takes the
instance-specific cut features as inputs, is trained and applied in cut ranking
and selection. In order to evaluate our method, we conduct extensive
experiments on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets. Compared with
commonly used heuristics for cut selection, the learning-based policy has shown
to be more effective, and is capable of generalizing over multiple problems
with different properties. Cut Ranking has been deployed in an industrial
solver for large-scale MIPs. In the online A/B testing of the product planning
problems with more than $10^7$ variables and constraints daily, Cut Ranking has
achieved the average speedup ratio of 12.42% over the production solver without
any accuracy loss of solution.]]></summary>

paper, we show that a deep temporal-coded SNN can be trained easily and
directly over the benchmark datasets CIFAR10 and ImageNet, with testing
accuracy within 1% of the DNN of equivalent size and architecture. Training
becomes similar to DNN thanks to the closed-form solution to the spiking
waveform dynamics. Considering that SNNs should be implemented in practical
neuromorphic hardwares, we train the deep SNN with weights quantized to 8, 4, 2
bits and with weights perturbed by random noise to demonstrate its robustness
in practical applications. In addition, we develop a phase-domain signal

logs via a model-based approach. A forward model of the world supervises a
driving policy that predicts the outcome of any potential driving trajectory.
To support learning from pre-recorded logs, we assume that the world is on
rails, meaning neither the agent nor its actions influence the environment.
This assumption greatly simplifies the learning problem, factorizing the
dynamics into a nonreactive world model and a low-dimensional and compact
forward model of the ego-vehicle. Our approach computes action-values for each
training trajectory using a tabular dynamic-programming evaluation of the
Bellman equations; these action-values in turn supervise the final vision-based
driving policy. Despite the world-on-rails assumption, the final driving policy
acts well in a dynamic and reactive world. At the time of writing, our method
ranks first on the CARLA leaderboard, attaining a 25% higher driving score

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modern neural networks are powerful predictive models. However, when it comes
to recognizing that they may be wrong about their predictions, they perform
poorly. For example, for one of the most common activation functions, the ReLU
and its variants, even a well-calibrated model can produce incorrect but high
confidence predictions. In the related task of action recognition, most current
classification methods are based on clip-level classifiers that densely sample
a given video for non-overlapping, same-sized clips and aggregate the results
using an aggregation function - typically averaging - to achieve video level
predictions. While this approach has shown to be effective, it is sub-optimal
in recognition accuracy and has a high computational overhead. To mitigate both
these issues, we propose the confidence distillation framework to teach a
representation of uncertainty of the teacher to the student sampler and divide
the task of full video prediction between the student and the teacher models.
We conduct extensive experiments on three action recognition datasets and
demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements in action
recognition accuracy (up to 20%) and computational efficiency (more than 40%).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Instance-level image retrieval is the task of searching in a large database
for images that match an object in a query image. To address this task, systems
usually rely on a retrieval step that uses global image descriptors, and a
subsequent step that performs domain-specific refinements or reranking by
leveraging operations such as geometric verification based on local features.
In this work, we propose Reranking Transformers (RRTs) as a general model to
incorporate both local and global features to rerank the matching images in a
supervised fashion and thus replace the relatively expensive process of
geometric verification. RRTs are lightweight and can be easily parallelized so
that reranking a set of top matching results can be performed in a single
forward-pass. We perform extensive experiments on the Revisited Oxford and
Paris datasets, and the Google Landmarks v2 dataset, showing that RRTs
outperform previous reranking approaches while using much fewer local
descriptors. Moreover, we demonstrate that, unlike existing approaches, RRTs
can be optimized jointly with the feature extractor, which can lead to feature
representations tailored to downstream tasks and further accuracy improvements.

environments to ensure safety without being overly cautious. Prior work
explored occlusion inference from observed social behaviors of road agents.
Inferring occupancy from agent behaviors is an inherently multimodal problem; a
driver may behave in the same manner for different occupancy patterns ahead of
them (e.g., a driver may move at constant speed in traffic or on an open road).
Past work, however, does not account for this multimodality, thus neglecting to
model this source of aleatoric uncertainty in the relationship between driver
behaviors and their environment. We propose an occlusion inference method that
characterizes observed behaviors of human agents as sensor measurements, and
fuses them with those from a standard sensor suite. To capture the aleatoric
uncertainty, we train a conditional variational autoencoder with a discrete
latent space to learn a multimodal mapping from observed driver trajectories to
an occupancy grid representation of the view ahead of the driver. Our method
handles multi-agent scenarios, combining measurements from multiple observed
drivers using evidential theory to solve the sensor fusion problem. Our
approach is validated on a real-world dataset, outperforming baselines and
demonstrating real-time capable performance. Our code is available at

combine non-invasive image analysis and machine learning, have been
successfully applied to identify and quantify plant health and diseases.
However, these techniques usually do not consider the progressive nature of
plant stress and often require images showing severe signs of stress to ensure
high confidence detection, thereby reducing the feasibility for early detection
and recovery of plants under stress. To overcome the problem mentioned above,
we propose a deep learning pipeline for the temporal analysis of the visual
changes induced in the plant due to stress and apply it to the specific water
stress identification case in Chickpea plant shoot images. For this, we have
considered an image dataset of two chickpea varieties JG-62 and Pusa-372, under
three water stress conditions; control, young seedling, and before flowering,
captured over five months. We have employed a variant of Convolutional Neural
Network - Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) network to learn spatio-temporal
patterns from the chickpea plant dataset and use them for water stress
classification. Our model has achieved ceiling level classification performance
of 98.52% on JG-62 and 97.78% on Pusa-372 chickpea plant data and has
outperformed the best reported time-invariant technique by at least 14% for
both JG-62 and Pusa-372 species, to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, our
CNN-LSTM model has demonstrated robustness to noisy input, with a less than
2.5% dip in average model accuracy and a small standard deviation about the
mean for both species. Lastly, we have performed an ablation study to analyze
the performance of the CNN-LSTM model by decreasing the number of temporal
session data used for training.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We propose CX-ToM, short for counterfactual explanations with theory-of mind,
a new explainable AI (XAI) framework for explaining decisions made by a deep
convolutional neural network (CNN). In contrast to the current methods in XAI
that generate explanations as a single shot response, we pose explanation as an
iterative communication process, i.e. dialog, between the machine and human
user. More concretely, our CX-ToM framework generates sequence of explanations
in a dialog by mediating the differences between the minds of machine and human
user. To do this, we use Theory of Mind (ToM) which helps us in explicitly
modeling human's intention, machine's mind as inferred by the human as well as
human's mind as inferred by the machine. Moreover, most state-of-the-art XAI
frameworks provide attention (or heat map) based explanations. In our work, we
show that these attention based explanations are not sufficient for increasing
human trust in the underlying CNN model. In CX-ToM, we instead use
counterfactual explanations called fault-lines which we define as follows:
given an input image I for which a CNN classification model M predicts class
c_pred, a fault-line identifies the minimal semantic-level features (e.g.,
stripes on zebra, pointed ears of dog), referred to as explainable concepts,
that need to be added to or deleted from I in order to alter the classification
category of I by M to another specified class c_alt. We argue that, due to the
iterative, conceptual and counterfactual nature of CX-ToM explanations, our
framework is practical and more natural for both expert and non-expert users to
understand the internal workings of complex deep learning models. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments verify our hypotheses, demonstrating
that our CX-ToM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art explainable AI
models.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Convolution neural networks have been successful in solving many socially
important and economically significant problems. Their ability to learn complex
high-dimensional functions hierarchically can be attributed to the use of
nonlinear activation functions. A key discovery that made training deep
networks feasible was the adoption of the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
activation function to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem caused by using
saturating activation functions. Since then many improved variants of the ReLU
activation have been proposed. However a majority of activation functions used
today are non-oscillatory and monotonically increasing due to their biological
plausibility. This paper demonstrates that oscillatory activation functions can
improve gradient flow and reduce network size. It is shown that oscillatory
activation functions allow neurons to switch classification (sign of output)
within the interior of neuronal hyperplane positive and negative half-spaces
allowing complex decisions with fewer neurons. A new oscillatory activation
function C(z) = z cos z that outperforms Sigmoids, Swish, Mish and ReLU on a
variety of architectures and benchmarks is presented. This new activation
function allows even single neurons to exhibit nonlinear decision boundaries.
This paper presents a single neuron solution to the famous XOR problem.
Experimental results indicate that replacing the activation function in the
convolutional layers with C(z) significantly improves performance on CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100 and Imagenette.]]></summary>

(OPF) problems in electric power distribution systems. However, the use of
largely model-free reinforcement learning algorithms that completely ignore the
physics-based modeling of the power grid compromises the optimizer performance
and poses scalability challenges. This paper proposes a novel approach to
synergistically combine the physics-based models with learning-based algorithms
using imitation learning to solve distribution-level OPF problems.
Specifically, we propose imitation learning based improvements in deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) methods to solve the OPF problem for a specific
case of battery storage dispatch in the power distribution systems. The
proposed imitation learning algorithm uses the approximate optimal solutions
obtained from a linearized model-based OPF solver to provide a good initial
policy for the DRL algorithms while improving the training efficiency. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using IEEE 34-bus and
123-bus distribution feeders with numerous distribution-level battery storage

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-variate time series (MTS) data is a ubiquitous class of data
abstraction in the real world. Any instance of MTS is generated from a hybrid
dynamical system and their specific dynamics are usually unknown. The hybrid
nature of such a dynamical system is a result of complex external attributes,
such as geographic location and time of day, each of which can be categorized
into either spatial attributes or temporal attributes. Therefore, there are two
fundamental views which can be used to analyze MTS data, namely the spatial
view and the temporal view. Moreover, from each of these two views, we can
partition the set of data samples of MTS into disjoint forecasting tasks in
accordance with their associated attribute values. Then, samples of the same
task will manifest similar forthcoming pattern, which is less sophisticated to
be predicted in comparison with the original single-view setting. Considering
this insight, we propose a novel multi-view multi-task (MVMT) learning
framework for MTS forecasting. Instead of being explicitly presented in most
scenarios, MVMT information is deeply concealed in the MTS data, which severely
hinders the model from capturing it naturally. To this end, we develop two
kinds of basic operations, namely task-wise affine transformation and task-wise
normalization, respectively. Applying these two operations with prior knowledge
on the spatial and temporal view allows the model to adaptively extract MVMT
information while predicting. Extensive experiments on three datasets are
conducted to illustrate that canonical architectures can be greatly enhanced by
the MVMT learning framework in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. In
addition, we design rich case studies to reveal the properties of
representations produced at different phases in the entire prediction
procedure.]]></summary>

many researchers study the topic under a Q-Bot-A-Bot image-guessing game
setting, where the Questioner needs to raise a series of questions to collect
information of an undisclosed image. Despite progress has been made in
Supervised Learning (SL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), issues still exist.
Firstly, previous methods do not provide explicit and effective guidance for
Questioner to generate visually related and informative questions. Secondly,
the effect of RL is hampered by an incompetent component, i.e., the Guesser,
who makes image predictions based on the generated dialogs and assigns rewards
accordingly. To enhance VD Questioner: 1) we propose a Related entity enhanced
Questioner (ReeQ) that generates questions under the guidance of related
entities and learns entity-based questioning strategy from human dialogs; 2) we
propose an Augmented Guesser (AugG) that is strong and is optimized for the VD

our approach achieves state-of-theart performance on both image-guessing task

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Network quantization, which aims to reduce the bit-lengths of the network
weights and activations, has emerged for their deployments to resource-limited
devices. Although recent studies have successfully discretized a full-precision
network, they still incur large quantization errors after training, thus giving
rise to a significant performance gap between a full-precision network and its
quantized counterpart. In this work, we propose a novel quantization method for
neural networks, Cluster-Promoting Quantization (CPQ) that finds the optimal
quantization grids while naturally encouraging the underlying full-precision
weights to gather around those quantization grids cohesively during training.
This property of CPQ is thanks to our two main ingredients that enable
differentiable quantization: i) the use of the categorical distribution
designed by a specific probabilistic parametrization in the forward pass and
ii) our proposed multi-class straight-through estimator (STE) in the backward
pass. Since our second component, multi-class STE, is intrinsically biased, we
additionally propose a new bit-drop technique, DropBits, that revises the
standard dropout regularization to randomly drop bits instead of neurons. As a
natural extension of DropBits, we further introduce the way of learning
heterogeneous quantization levels to find proper bit-length for each layer by
imposing an additional regularization on DropBits. We experimentally validate
our method on various benchmark datasets and network architectures, and also
support a new hypothesis for quantization: learning heterogeneous quantization
levels outperforms the case using the same but fixed quantization levels from
scratch.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Growing use of machine learning in policy and social impact settings have
raised concerns for fairness implications, especially for racial minorities.
These concerns have generated considerable interest among machine learning and
artificial intelligence researchers, who have developed new methods and
established theoretical bounds for improving fairness, focusing on the source
data, regularization and model training, or post-hoc adjustments to model
scores. However, little work has studied the practical trade-offs between
fairness and accuracy in real-world settings to understand how these bounds and
methods translate into policy choices and impact on society. Our empirical
study fills this gap by investigating the impact of mitigating disparities on
accuracy, focusing on the common context of using machine learning to inform
benefit allocation in resource-constrained programs across education, mental
health, criminal justice, and housing safety. Here we describe applied work in
which we find fairness-accuracy trade-offs to be negligible in practice. In
each setting studied, explicitly focusing on achieving equity and using our
proposed post-hoc disparity mitigation methods, fairness was substantially
improved without sacrificing accuracy. This observation was robust across
policy contexts studied, scale of resources available for intervention, time,
and relative size of the protected groups. These empirical results challenge a
commonly held assumption that reducing disparities either requires accepting an
appreciable drop in accuracy or the development of novel, complex methods,
making reducing disparities in these applications more practical.]]></summary>

divergence between two distributions have been proposed and applied in
large-scale machine learning models. While they have been found to be unstable,
the theoretical root cause of the problem is not clear. In this paper, we study
a generative adversarial network based approach that uses a neural network
discriminator to estimate KL divergence. We argue that, in such case, high
fluctuations in the estimates are a consequence of not controlling the
complexity of the discriminator function space. We provide a theoretical
underpinning and remedy for this problem by first constructing a discriminator
in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). This enables us to leverage
sample complexity and mean embedding to theoretically relate the error
probability bound of the KL estimates to the complexity of the discriminator in
RKHS. Based on this theory, we then present a scalable way to control the
complexity of the discriminator for a reliable estimation of KL divergence. We
support both our proposed theory and method to control the complexity of the
RKHS discriminator through controlled experiments.]]></summary>

linguistics rely on unary modalities to allow for the controlled application of
structural rules affecting word order and phrase structure. These controlled
structural operations give rise to derivational ambiguities that are missed by
the original Lambek Calculus or its pregroup simplification. Proposals for
compositional interpretation of extended Lambek Calculus in the compact closed
category of FVect and linear maps have been made, but in these proposals the
syntax-semantics mapping ignores the control modalities, effectively
restricting their role to the syntax. Our aim is to turn the modalities into
first-class citizens of the vectorial interpretation. Building on the
directional density matrix semantics, we extend the interpretation of the type
system with an extra spin density matrix space. The interpretation of proofs
then results in ambiguous derivations being tensored with orthogonal spin
states. Our method introduces a way of simultaneously representing co-existing
interpretations of ambiguous utterances, and provides a uniform framework for
the integration of lexical and derivational ambiguity.]]></summary>

probabilities, we predict the label. Our refinement process corresponds to
recent findings of the adversarial subspace properties. We extensively evaluate
our approach on 16 adversarial attack benchmarks using ResNet-50,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Online continual learning for image classification studies the problem of
learning to classify images from an online stream of data and tasks, where
tasks may include new classes (class incremental) or data nonstationarity
(domain incremental). One of the key challenges of continual learning is to
avoid catastrophic forgetting (CF), i.e., forgetting old tasks in the presence
of more recent tasks. Over the past few years, many methods and tricks have
been introduced to address this problem, but many have not been fairly and
systematically compared under a variety of realistic and practical settings. To
better understand the relative advantages of various approaches and the
settings where they work best, this survey aims to (1) compare state-of-the-art
methods such as MIR, iCARL, and GDumb and determine which works best at
different experimental settings; (2) determine if the best class incremental
methods are also competitive in domain incremental setting; (3) evaluate the
performance of 7 simple but effective trick such as "review" trick and nearest
class mean (NCM) classifier to assess their relative impact. Regarding (1), we
observe iCaRL remains competitive when the memory buffer is small; GDumb
outperforms many recently proposed methods in medium-size datasets and MIR
performs the best in larger-scale datasets. For (2), we note that GDumb
performs quite poorly while MIR -- already competitive for (1) -- is also
strongly competitive in this very different but important setting. Overall,
this allows us to conclude that MIR is overall a strong and versatile method
across a wide variety of settings. For (3), we find that all 7 tricks are
beneficial, and when augmented with the "review" trick and NCM classifier, MIR
produces performance levels that bring online continual learning much closer to
its ultimate goal of matching offline training.]]></summary>

thousands of exoplanets and the possibility of the existence of billions of
them in our Galaxy. The biggest goal in these searches is whether there are
other life-harbouring planets. However, the question which of these detected
planets are habitable, potentially-habitable, or maybe even inhabited, is still
not answered. Some potentially habitable exoplanets have been hypothesized, but
since Earth is the only known habitable planet, measures of habitability are
necessarily determined with Earth as the reference. Several recent works
introduced new habitability metrics based on optimization methods.
Classification of potentially habitable exoplanets using supervised learning is
another emerging area of study. However, both modeling and supervised learning
approaches suffer from drawbacks. We propose an anomaly detection method, the
Multi-Stage Memetic Algorithm (MSMA), to detect anomalies and extend it to an
unsupervised clustering algorithm MSMVMCA to use it to detect potentially
habitable exoplanets as anomalies. The algorithm is based on the postulate that
Earth is an anomaly, with the possibility of existence of few other anomalies
among thousands of data points. We describe an MSMA-based clustering approach
with a novel distance function to detect habitable candidates as anomalies
(including Earth). The results are cross-matched with the habitable exoplanet
catalog (PHL-HEC) of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory (PHL) with both
optimistic and conservative lists of potentially habitable exoplanets.]]></summary>

image to resist potential noises while ensuring the embedded image has few
perceptual perturbations from the original one. Recently, with the tremendous
successes gained by deep neural networks in various fields, the researches of
data hiding with deep learning models have attracted an increasing number of
attentions. In the data hiding task, each pixel of cover images should be
treated differently since they have divergent tolerabilities. The neglect of
considering the sensitivity of each pixel will inevitably affect the model
robustness for information hiding. Targeting this problem, we propose a novel
deep data hiding scheme with Inverse Gradient Attention (IGA), combing the
ideas of adversarial learning and attention mechanism to endow different
sensitivities for different pixels. With the proposed component, the model can
spotlight pixels with more robustness for data hiding. Empirically, extensive
experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art

event-based cameras are noise sensitive and have low resolution. Moreover, the
task of moving object detection in these cameras is difficult, as event-based
sensors capture only the binary changes in brightness of a scene, lacking
useful visual features like texture and color. In this paper, we investigate

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning multilingual and multi-domain translation model is challenging as
the heterogeneous and imbalanced data make the model converge inconsistently
over different corpora in real world. One common practice is to adjust the
share of each corpus in the training, so that the learning process is balanced
and low-resource cases can benefit from the high resource ones. However,
automatic balancing methods usually depend on the intra- and inter-dataset
characteristics, which is usually agnostic or requires human priors. In this
work, we propose an approach, MultiUAT, that dynamically adjusts the training
data usage based on the model's uncertainty on a small set of trusted clean
data for multi-corpus machine translation. We experiments with two classes of
uncertainty measures on multilingual (16 languages with 4 settings) and
multi-domain settings (4 for in-domain and 2 for out-of-domain on
English-German translation) and demonstrate our approach MultiUAT substantially
outperforms its baselines, including both static and dynamic strategies. We
analyze the cross-domain transfer and show the deficiency of static and
similarity based methods.]]></summary>

geometric deep learning, it remains arduous to capture the complex topologies
of point cloud data with a learning model. Given a point cloud dataset
containing objects with various genera, or scenes with multiple objects, we
propose an autoencoder, TearingNet, which tackles the challenging task of
representing the point clouds using a fixed-length descriptor. Unlike existing
works directly deforming predefined primitives of genus zero (e.g., a 2D square
patch) to an object-level point cloud, our TearingNet is characterized by a
proposed Tearing network module and a Folding network module interacting with
each other iteratively. Particularly, the Tearing network module learns the
point cloud topology explicitly. By breaking the edges of a primitive graph, it
tears the graph into patches or with holes to emulate the topology of a target
point cloud, leading to faithful reconstructions. Experimentation shows the
superiority of our proposal in terms of reconstructing point clouds as well as
generating more topology-friendly representations than benchmarks.]]></summary>

to the new reality, where people may wear surgical masks to cover their noses
and mouths. Traditional data sets (e.g., CelebA, CASIA-WebFace) used for
training these systems were released before the pandemic, so they now seem
unsuited due to the lack of examples of people wearing masks. We propose a
method for enhancing data sets containing faces without masks by creating
synthetic masks and overlaying them on faces in the original images. Our method
relies on Spark AR Studio, a developer program made by Facebook that is used to
create Instagram face filters. In our approach, we use 9 masks of different
colors, shapes and fabrics. We employ our method to generate a number of
445,446 (90%) samples of masks for the CASIA-WebFace data set and 196,254
(96.8%) masks for the CelebA data set, releasing the mask images at
https://github.com/securifai/masked_faces. We show that our method produces
significantly more realistic training examples of masks overlaid on faces by
asking volunteers to qualitatively compare it to other methods or data sets
designed for the same task. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our method by
evaluating state-of-the-art face recognition systems (FaceNet, VGG-face,
ArcFace) trained on the enhanced data sets and showing that they outperform
equivalent systems trained on the original data sets (containing faces without
masks), when the test benchmark contains masked faces.]]></summary>

recognition tasks, yet is currently limited to visual features or individual
visual concepts such as objects. In this paper, we propose one of the first
methods that learn from image-sentence pairs to extract a graphical
representation of localized objects and their relationships within an image,
known as scene graph. To bridge the gap between images and texts, we leverage
an off-the-shelf object detector to identify and localize object instances,
match labels of detected regions to concepts parsed from captions, and thus
create "pseudo" labels for learning scene graph. Further, we design a
Transformer-based model to predict these "pseudo" labels via a masked token
prediction task. Learning from only image-sentence pairs, our model achieves
30% relative gain over a latest method trained with human-annotated unlocalized
scene graphs. Our model also shows strong results for weakly and fully
supervised scene graph generation. In addition, we explore an open-vocabulary
setting for detecting scene graphs, and present the first result for open-set
scene graph generation. Our code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Objective: To propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) architecture -- the
filter bank convolutional neural network (FBCNN) -- to improve SSVEP
classification in single-channel BCIs with small data lengths.

Methods: We propose two models: the FBCNN-2D and the FBCNN-3D. The FBCNN-2D
utilizes a filter bank to create sub-band components of the
electroencephalography (EEG) signal, which it transforms using the fast Fourier
transform (FFT) and analyzes with a 2D CNN. The FBCNN-3D utilizes the same
filter bank, but it transforms the sub-band components into spectrograms via
short-time Fourier transform (STFT), and analyzes them with a 3D CNN. We made
use of transfer learning. To train the FBCNN-3D, we proposed a new technique,
called inter-dimensional transfer learning, to transfer knowledge from a 2D DNN
to a 3D DNN. Our BCI was conceived so as not to require calibration from the
final user: therefore, the test subject data was separated from training and
validation.

Results: The mean test accuracy was 85.7% for the FBCCA-2D and 85% for the
FBCCA-3D. Mean F1-Scores were 0.858 and 0.853. Alternative classification
methods, SVM, FBCCA and a CNN, had mean accuracy of 79.2%, 80.1% and 81.4%,
respectively.

Conclusion: The FBCNNs surpassed traditional SSVEP classification methods in
our simulated BCI, by a considerable margin (about 5% higher accuracy).
Transfer learning and inter-dimensional transfer learning made training much
faster and more predictable.

Significance: We proposed a new and flexible type of DNN, which had a better
performance than standard methods in SSVEP classification for portable and fast
BCIs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dialogue summarization has drawn much attention recently. Especially in the
customer service domain, agents could use dialogue summaries to help boost
their works by quickly knowing customer's issues and service progress. These
applications require summaries to contain the perspective of a single speaker
and have a clear topic flow structure, while neither are available in existing
datasets. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel Chinese dataset for
Customer Service Dialogue Summarization (CSDS). CSDS improves the abstractive
summaries in two aspects: (1) In addition to the overall summary for the whole
dialogue, role-oriented summaries are also provided to acquire different
speakers' viewpoints. (2) All the summaries sum up each topic separately, thus
containing the topic-level structure of the dialogue. We define tasks in CSDS
as generating the overall summary and different role-oriented summaries for a
given dialogue. Next, we compare various summarization methods on CSDS, and
experiment results show that existing methods are prone to generate redundant
and incoherent summaries. Besides, the performance becomes much worse when
analyzing the performance on role-oriented summaries and topic structures. We
hope that this study could benchmark Chinese dialogue summarization and benefit
further studies.]]></summary>

defense methods against various adversarial attacks. To our knowledge, existing
AT-based methods usually train with the locally most adversarial perturbed
points and treat all the perturbed points equally, which may lead to
considerably weaker adversarial robust generalization on test data. In this
work, we introduce a new adversarial training framework that considers the
diversity as well as characteristics of the perturbed points in the vicinity of
benign samples. To realize the framework, we propose a Regional Adversarial
Training (RAT) defense method that first utilizes the attack path generated by
the typical iterative attack method of projected gradient descent (PGD), and
constructs an adversarial region based on the attack path. Then, RAT samples
diverse perturbed training points efficiently inside this region, and utilizes
a distance-aware label smoothing mechanism to capture our intuition that
perturbed points at different locations should have different impact on the
model performance. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show
that RAT consistently makes significant improvement on standard adversarial
training (SAT), and exhibits better robust generalization.]]></summary>

concerns in recent years. Following the success of deep learning, existing
methods always formulate DeepFake video detection as a binary classification
problem and develop frame-based and video-based solutions. However, little

forged videos. To address this issue, we term this task as a Spatial-Temporal
Inconsistency Learning (STIL) process and instantiate it into a novel STIL
block, which consists of a Spatial Inconsistency Module (SIM), a Temporal
Inconsistency Module (TIM), and an Information Supplement Module (ISM).
Specifically, we present a novel temporal modeling paradigm in TIM by
exploiting the temporal difference over adjacent frames along with both
horizontal and vertical directions. And the ISM simultaneously utilizes the
spatial information from SIM and temporal information from TIM to establish a
more comprehensive spatial-temporal representation. Moreover, our STIL block is
flexible and could be plugged into existing 2D CNNs. Extensive experiments and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning hierarchical structures in sequential data -- from simple
algorithmic patterns to natural language -- in a reliable, generalizable way
remains a challenging problem for neural language models. Past work has shown
that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) struggle to generalize on held-out
algorithmic or syntactic patterns without supervision or some inductive bias.
To remedy this, many papers have explored augmenting RNNs with various
differentiable stacks, by analogy with finite automata and pushdown automata.
In this paper, we present a stack RNN model based on the recently proposed
Nondeterministic Stack RNN (NS-RNN) that achieves lower cross-entropy than all
previous stack RNNs on five context-free language modeling tasks (within 0.05
nats of the information-theoretic lower bound), including a task in which the
NS-RNN previously failed to outperform a deterministic stack RNN baseline. Our
model assigns arbitrary positive weights instead of probabilities to stack
actions, and we provide an analysis of why this improves training. We also
propose a restricted version of the NS-RNN that makes it practical to use for
language modeling on natural language and present results on the Penn Treebank
corpus.]]></summary>

ability to capture high-level semantic information, such as relations between
entities in text, is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive
learning framework that trains sentence embeddings to encode the relations in a
graph structure. Given a sentence (unstructured text) and its graph, we use
contrastive learning to impose relation-related structure on the token-level
representations of the sentence obtained with a CharacterBERT (El Boukkouri et
al.,2020) model. The resulting relation-aware sentence embeddings achieve
state-of-the-art results on the relation extraction task using only a simple
KNN classifier, thereby demonstrating the success of the proposed method.
Additional visualization by a tSNE analysis shows the effectiveness of the
learned representation space compared to baselines. Furthermore, we show that
we can learn a different space for named entity recognition, again using a
contrastive learning objective, and demonstrate how to successfully combine
both representation spaces in an entity-relation task.]]></summary>

extensively used in online chatting scenarios since they manage to make
dialogues vivid, moving, and interesting. However, most current dialogue
researches focus on text-only dialogue tasks. In this paper, we propose a new
task named as \textbf{M}eme incorporated \textbf{O}pen-domain \textbf{D}ialogue

it requires the model to understand the multimodal elements as well as the
emotions behind them. To facilitate the MOD research, we construct a
large-scale open-domain multimodal dialogue dataset incorporating abundant
Internet memes into utterances. The dataset consists of $\sim$45K Chinese
conversations with $\sim$606K utterances. Each conversation contains about $13$
utterances with about $4$ Internet memes on average and each utterance equipped
with an Internet meme is annotated with the corresponding emotion. In addition,
we present a simple and effective method, which utilizes a unified generation
network to solve the MOD task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
trained on the proposed corpus is able to achieve expressive communication

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Humans (e.g., crowdworkers) have a remarkable ability in solving different
tasks, by simply reading textual instructions that define them and looking at a
few examples. NLP models built with the conventional paradigm, however, often
struggle with generalization across tasks (e.g., a question-answering system
cannot solve classification tasks). A long-standing challenge in AI is to build
a model that is equipped with the understanding of human-readable instructions
that define the tasks, and can generalize to new tasks. To study this, we
introduce NATURAL INSTRUCTIONS, a dataset of 61 distinct tasks, their
human-authored instructions and 193k task instances. The instructions are
obtained from crowdsourcing instructions used to collect existing NLP datasets
and mapped to a unified schema. We adopt generative pre-trained language models
to encode task-specific instructions along with input and generate task output.
Our results indicate that models can benefit from instructions to generalize
across tasks. These models, however, are far behind supervised task-specific
models, indicating significant room for more progress in this direction.]]></summary>

applications. However, it is difficult to tell beforehand if a DNN receiving an
input will deliver the correct output since their decision criteria are usually
nontransparent. A DNN delivers the correct output if the input is within the
area enclosed by its generalization envelope. In this case, the information
contained in the input sample is processed reasonably by the network. It is of
large practical importance to assess at inference time if a DNN generalizes
correctly. Currently, the approaches to achieve this goal are investigated in
different problem set-ups rather independently from one another, leading to
three main research and literature fields: predictive uncertainty,
out-of-distribution detection and adversarial example detection. This survey
connects the three fields within the larger framework of investigating the
generalization performance of machine learning methods and in particular DNNs.
We underline the common ground, point at the most promising approaches and give
a structured overview of the methods that provide at inference time means to
establish if the current input is within the generalization envelope of a DNN.]]></summary>

existing attacks are often assessed using different SR models, recognition
tasks and datasets, and only few adversarial defenses borrowed from computer
vision are considered. Yet,these defenses have not been thoroughly evaluated
against adaptive attacks. Thus, there is still a lack of quantitative
understanding about the strengths and limitations of adversarial attacks and
defenses. More effective defenses are also required for securing SR systems. To
bridge this gap, we present SEC4SR, the first platform enabling researchers to
systematically and comprehensively evaluate adversarial attacks and defenses in
SR. SEC4SR incorporates 4 white-box and 2 black-box attacks, 24 defenses
including our novel feature-level transformations. It also contains techniques
for mounting adaptive attacks. Using SEC4SR, we conduct thus far the
largest-scale empirical study on adversarial attacks and defenses in SR,
involving 23 defenses, 15 attacks and 4 attack settings. Our study provides
lots of useful findings that may advance future research: such as (1) all the
transformations slightly degrade accuracy on benign examples and their
effectiveness vary with attacks; (2) most transformations become less effective
under adaptive attacks, but some transformations become more effective; (3) few
transformations combined with adversarial training yield stronger defenses over
some but not all attacks, while our feature-level transformation combined with
adversarial training yields the strongest defense over all the attacks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate capabilities and advantages of SEC4SR which
can benefit future research in SR.]]></summary>

weighted-decoding methods: re-ranking beam candidates from pre-trained models

weighted-decoding methods are inherently constrained by the low-variance
high-bias pre-trained model. In this work, we propose a novel approach to
control the generation of Transformer-based pre-trained language models: the
SideControl framework, which leverages a novel control attributes loss to
incorporate useful control signals, and is shown to perform well with very

diversity of AI and non-AI modules with huge code sizes and long and
complicated execution paths, which raises serious benchmarking or evaluating
challenges. Using AI components or micro benchmarks alone can lead to
error-prone conclusions. This paper presents a methodology to attack the above
challenge. We formalize a real-world application scenario as a Directed Acyclic
Graph-based model and propose the rules to distill it into a permutation of
essential AI and non-AI tasks, which we call a scenario benchmark. Together
with seventeen industry partners, we extract nine typical scenario benchmarks.
We design and implement an extensible, configurable, and flexible benchmark
framework. We implement two Internet service AI scenario benchmarks based on
the framework as proxies to two real-world application scenarios. We consider
scenario, component, and micro benchmarks as three indispensable parts for
evaluating. Our evaluation shows the advantage of our methodology against using

occurrence of a future accident from dashcam videos, which is vital for a
safety-guaranteed self-driving system. To encourage an early and accurate
decision, existing approaches typically focus on capturing the cues of spatial
and temporal context before a future accident occurs. However, their
decision-making lacks visual explanation and ignores the dynamic interaction
with the environment. In this paper, we propose Deep ReInforced accident
anticipation with Visual Explanation, named DRIVE. The method simulates both
the bottom-up and top-down visual attention mechanism in a dashcam observation
environment so that the decision from the proposed stochastic multi-task agent
can be visually explained by attentive regions. Moreover, the proposed dense
anticipation reward and sparse fixation reward are effective in training the
DRIVE model with our improved reinforcement learning algorithm. Experimental
results show that the DRIVE model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
multiple real-world traffic accident datasets. Code and pre-trained model are

dynamical systems in recent years. Modern dynamical systems are becoming
increasingly non-linear and complex, and there is a need for a framework to
model these systems in a compact and comprehensive representation for
prediction and control. The central problem in applying Koopman theory to a
system of interest is that the choice of finite-dimensional basis functions is
typically done apriori, using expert knowledge of the systems dynamics. Our
approach learns these basis functions using a supervised learning approach
where a combination of autoencoders and deep neural networks learn the basis
functions for any given system. We demonstrate this approach on a simple
pendulum example in which we obtain a linear representation of the non-linear
system and then predict the future state trajectories given some initial
conditions. We also explore how changing the input representation of the
dynamic systems time series data can impact the quality of learned basis
functions. This alternative representation is compared to the traditional raw
time series data approach to determine which method results in lower
reconstruction and prediction error of the true non-linear dynamics of the
system.]]></summary>

multiple views of a shared context. Recent works intuitively apply contrastive
learning (CL) to learn representations, regarded as a pairwise manner, which is
still scalable: view-specific noise is not filtered in learning view-shared
representations; the fake negative pairs, where the negative terms are actually
within the same class as the positive, and the real negative pairs are
coequally treated; and evenly measuring the similarities between terms might
interfere with optimization. Importantly, few works research the theoretical
framework of generalized self-supervised multi-view learning, especially for
more than two views. To this end, we rethink the existing multi-view learning
paradigm from the information theoretical perspective and then propose a novel
information theoretical framework for generalized multi-view learning. Guided
by it, we build a multi-view coding method with a three-tier progressive
architecture, namely Information theory-guided heuristic Progressive Multi-view
Coding (IPMC). In the distribution-tier, IPMC aligns the distribution between
views to reduce view-specific noise. In the set-tier, IPMC builds self-adjusted
pools for contrasting, which utilizes a view filter to adaptively modify the
pools. Lastly, in the instance-tier, we adopt a designed unified loss to learn
discriminative representations and reduce the gradient interference.
Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate the superiority of IPMC over
state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

to exploit auditory information to aid the visual models, however, the
performance is limited due to the lack of an effective approach for feature

network to address the critical challenges in crowd counting by effectively
utilizing both visual and audio inputs for better modalities association and
productive feature extraction. The proposed network introduces the notion of
auxiliary and explicit image patch-importance ranking (PIR) and patch-wise
crowd estimate (PCE) information to produce a third (run-time) modality. These
modalities (audio, visual, run-time) undergo a transformer-inspired
cross-modality co-attention mechanism to finally output the crowd estimate. To
acquire rich visual features, we propose a multi-branch structure with
transformer-style fusion in-between. Extensive experimental evaluations show
that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art networks under all
evaluation settings with up to 33.8% improvement. We also analyze and compare

which can potentially be used for several applications. However, noise, band
correlations and high dimensionality restrict the applicability of such data.
This is recently addressed using creative deep learning network architectures
such as ResNet, SSRN, and A2S2K. However, the last layer, i.e the
classification layer, remains unchanged and is taken to be the softmax
classifier. In this article, we propose to use a watershed classifier.
Watershed classifier extends the watershed operator from Mathematical
Morphology for classification. In its vanilla form, the watershed classifier
does not have any trainable parameters. In this article, we propose a novel
approach to train deep learning networks to obtain representations suitable for
the watershed classifier. The watershed classifier exploits the connectivity
patterns, a characteristic of HSI datasets, for better inference. We show that
exploiting such characteristics allows the Triplet-Watershed to achieve
state-of-art results in supervised and semi-supervised contexts. These results
are validated on Indianpines (IP), University of Pavia (UP), Kennedy Space
Center (KSC) and University of Houston (UH) datasets, relying on simple convnet
architecture using a quarter of parameters compared to previous
state-of-the-art networks. The source code for reproducing the experiments and

as it enables them to properly perceive the surrounding environment and to
carry out targeted operations. The most recent methods make use of
state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to learn a valid model for the
target task. However, those techniques need a large amount of labeled data for
training. A recent approach to deal with this issue is data augmentation
through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), where entire synthetic scenes
are added to the training data, thus enlarging and diversifying their
informative content. In this work, we propose an alternative solution with
respect to the common data augmentation methods, applying it to the fundamental
problem of crop/weed segmentation in precision farming. Starting from real
images, we create semi-artificial samples by replacing the most relevant object
classes (i.e., crop and weeds) with their synthesized counterparts. To do that,
we employ a conditional GAN (cGAN), where the generative model is trained by
conditioning the shape of the generated object. Moreover, in addition to RGB
data, we take into account also near-infrared (NIR) information, generating
four channel multi-spectral synthetic images. Quantitative experiments, carried
out on three publicly available datasets, show that (i) our model is capable of
generating realistic multi-spectral images of plants and (ii) the usage of such
synthetic images in the training process improves the segmentation performance
of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation convolutional networks.]]></summary>

applications in computer vision and robotics for solving non-convex
optimization problems involving rotations? In studying the empirical
performance we note that there are few failure cases reported in the
literature, in particular for estimation problems with a single rotation,
motivating us to gain further theoretical understanding.

A general framework based on tools from algebraic geometry is introduced for
analyzing the power of semidefinite relaxations of problems with quadratic
objective functions and rotational constraints. Applications include
registration, hand-eye calibration and rotation averaging. We characterize the
extreme points, and show that there exist failure cases for which the
relaxation is not tight, even in the case of a single rotation. We also show
that some problem classes are always tight given an appropriate

implicit 3D representations and addressing different tasks such as novel-view
synthesis or depth-map estimation. However, in downstream applications where
decisions need to be made based on automatic predictions, it is critical to
leverage the confidence associated with the model estimations. Whereas
uncertainty quantification is a long-standing problem in Machine Learning, it
has been largely overlooked in the recent NeRF literature. In this context, we
propose Stochastic Neural Radiance Fields (S-NeRF), a generalization of
standard NeRF that learns a probability distribution over all the possible
radiance fields modeling the scene. This distribution allows to quantify the
uncertainty associated with the scene information provided by the model. S-NeRF
optimization is posed as a Bayesian learning problem which is efficiently
addressed using the Variational Inference framework. Exhaustive experiments
over benchmark datasets demonstrate that S-NeRF is able to provide more
reliable predictions and confidence values than generic approaches previously
proposed for uncertainty estimation in other domains.]]></summary>

for images, the GeneAnnotator. This software allows human annotators to
describe the existing relationships between participators in the visual scene
in the form of directed graphs, hence enabling the learning and reasoning on
visual relationships, e.g., image captioning, VQA and scene graph generation,
etc. The annotations for certain image datasets could either be merged in a
single VG150 data-format file to support most existing models for scene graph
learning or transformed into a separated annotation file for each single image
to build customized datasets. Moreover, GeneAnnotator provides a rule-based
relationship recommending algorithm to reduce the heavy annotation workload.
With GeneAnnotator, we propose Traffic Genome, a comprehensive scene graph
dataset with 1000 diverse traffic images, which in return validates the
effectiveness of the proposed software for scene graph annotation. The project

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Online continual learning for image classification studies the problem of
learning to classify images from an online stream of data and tasks, where
tasks may include new classes (class incremental) or data nonstationarity
(domain incremental). One of the key challenges of continual learning is to
avoid catastrophic forgetting (CF), i.e., forgetting old tasks in the presence
of more recent tasks. Over the past few years, many methods and tricks have
been introduced to address this problem, but many have not been fairly and
systematically compared under a variety of realistic and practical settings. To
better understand the relative advantages of various approaches and the
settings where they work best, this survey aims to (1) compare state-of-the-art
methods such as MIR, iCARL, and GDumb and determine which works best at
different experimental settings; (2) determine if the best class incremental
methods are also competitive in domain incremental setting; (3) evaluate the
performance of 7 simple but effective trick such as "review" trick and nearest
class mean (NCM) classifier to assess their relative impact. Regarding (1), we
observe iCaRL remains competitive when the memory buffer is small; GDumb
outperforms many recently proposed methods in medium-size datasets and MIR
performs the best in larger-scale datasets. For (2), we note that GDumb
performs quite poorly while MIR -- already competitive for (1) -- is also
strongly competitive in this very different but important setting. Overall,
this allows us to conclude that MIR is overall a strong and versatile method
across a wide variety of settings. For (3), we find that all 7 tricks are
beneficial, and when augmented with the "review" trick and NCM classifier, MIR
produces performance levels that bring online continual learning much closer to
its ultimate goal of matching offline training.]]></summary>

vasculatures from fundus images help identify early signs of many crucial
illnesses such as diabetic retinopathy. Due to the varying shape, size, and
patterns of retinal vessels, along with artefacts and noises in fundus images,
no one-stage method can accurately segment retinal vessels. In this work, we
propose a multi-scale, multi-level attention embedded CNN architecture
((M)SLAe-Net) to address the issue of multi-stage processing for robust and
precise segmentation of retinal vessels. We do this by extracting features at
multiple scales and multiple levels of the network, enabling our model to
holistically extracts the local and global features. Multi-scale features are
extracted using our novel dynamic dilated pyramid pooling (D-DPP) module. We
also aggregate the features from all the network levels. These effectively
resolved the issues of varying shapes and artefacts and hence the need for
multiple stages. To assist in better pixel-level classification, we use the
Squeeze and Attention(SA) module, a smartly adapted version of the Squeeze and
Excitation(SE) module for segmentation tasks in our network to facilitate
pixel-group attention. Our unique network design and novel D-DPP module with
efficient task-specific loss function for thin vessels enabled our model for
better cross data performance. Exhaustive experimental results on DRIVE, STARE,

of key importance and relevance to a real-world setting. For question answering
(QA), the current state-of-the-art pre-trained models typically need
fine-tuning on tens of thousands of examples to obtain good results. Their
performance degrades significantly in a few-shot setting (< 100 examples). To
address this, we propose a simple fine-tuning framework that leverages
pre-trained text-to-text models and is directly aligned with their pre-training
framework. Specifically, we construct the input as a concatenation of the
question, a mask token representing the answer span and a context. Given this
input, the model is fine-tuned using the same objective as that of its
pre-training objective. Through experimental studies on various few-shot
configurations, we show that this formulation leads to significant gains on
multiple QA benchmarks (an absolute gain of 34.2 F1 points on average when
there are only 16 training examples). The gains extend further when used with
larger models (Eg:- 72.3 F1 on SQuAD using BART-large with only 32 examples)
and translate well to a multilingual setting . On the multilingual TydiQA
benchmark, our model outperforms the XLM-Roberta-large by an absolute margin of
upto 40 F1 points and an average of 33 F1 points in a few-shot setting (<= 64
training examples). We conduct detailed ablation studies to analyze factors
contributing to these gains.]]></summary>

learning hierarchical reasoning graph networks. Conventional methods usually
focus on learning discriminative features for each facial image of a paired
sample and neglect how to fuse the obtained two facial image features and
reason about the relations between them. To address this, we propose a
Star-shaped Reasoning Graph Network (S-RGN). Our S-RGN first constructs a
star-shaped graph where each surrounding node encodes the information of
comparisons in a feature dimension and the central node is employed as the
bridge for the interaction of surrounding nodes. Then we perform relational
reasoning on this star graph with iterative message passing. The proposed S-RGN
uses only one central node to analyze and process information from all
surrounding nodes, which limits its reasoning capacity. We further develop a
Hierarchical Reasoning Graph Network (H-RGN) to exploit more powerful and
flexible capacity. More specifically, our H-RGN introduces a set of latent
reasoning nodes and constructs a hierarchical graph with them. Then bottom-up
comparative information abstraction and top-down comprehensive signal
propagation are iteratively performed on the hierarchical graph to update the
node features. Extensive experimental results on four widely used kinship
databases show that the proposed methods achieve very competitive results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The goal of object navigation is to reach the expected objects according to
visual information in the unseen environments. Previous works usually implement
deep models to train an agent to predict actions in real-time. However, in the
unseen environment, when the target object is not in egocentric view, the agent
may not be able to make wise decisions due to the lack of guidance. In this
paper, we propose a hierarchical object-to-zone (HOZ) graph to guide the agent
in a coarse-to-fine manner, and an online-learning mechanism is also proposed
to update HOZ according to the real-time observation in new environments. In
particular, the HOZ graph is composed of scene nodes, zone nodes and object
nodes. With the pre-learned HOZ graph, the real-time observation and the target
goal, the agent can constantly plan an optimal path from zone to zone. In the
estimated path, the next potential zone is regarded as sub-goal, which is also
fed into the deep reinforcement learning model for action prediction. Our
methods are evaluated on the AI2-Thor simulator. In addition to widely used
evaluation metrics SR and SPL, we also propose a new evaluation metric of SAE
that focuses on the effective action rate. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.]]></summary>

or 3-D coronary angiography require prior information, e.g., the phase during a
cardiac cycle with least motion, called resting phase (RP). The purpose of this
work is to propose a fully automated framework that allows the detection of the
right coronary artery (RCA) RP within CINE series. Methods: The proposed
prototype system consists of three main steps. First, the localization of the
regions of interest (ROI) is performed. Second, as CINE series are
time-resolved, the cropped ROI series over all time points are taken for
tracking motions quantitatively. Third, the output motion values are used to
classify RPs. In this work, we focused on the detection of the area with the
outer edge of the cross-section of the RCA as our target. The proposed
framework was evaluated on 102 clinically acquired dataset at 1.5T and 3T. The
automatically classified RPs were compared with the ground truth RPs annotated
manually by a medical expert for testing the robustness and feasibility of the
framework. Results: The predicted RCA RPs showed high agreement with the
experts annotated RPs with 92.7% accuracy, 90.5% sensitivity and 95.0%
specificity for the unseen study dataset. The mean absolute difference of the
start and end RP was 13.6 ${\pm}$ 18.6 ms for the validation study dataset
(n=102). Conclusion: In this work, automated RP detection has been introduced
by the proposed framework and demonstrated feasibility, robustness, and
applicability for diverse static imaging acquisitions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Model compression techniques are recently gaining explosive attention for
obtaining efficient AI models for various real-time applications. Channel
pruning is one important compression strategy and is widely used in slimming
various DNNs. Previous gate-based or importance-based pruning methods aim to
remove channels whose importance is smallest. However, it remains unclear what
criteria the channel importance should be measured on, leading to various
channel selection heuristics. Some other sampling-based pruning methods deploy
sampling strategies to train sub-nets, which often causes the training
instability and the compressed model's degraded performance. In view of the
research gaps, we present a new module named Gates with Differentiable
Polarization (GDP), inspired by principled optimization ideas. GDP can be
plugged before convolutional layers without bells and whistles, to control the
on-and-off of each channel or whole layer block. During the training process,
the polarization effect will drive a subset of gates to smoothly decrease to
exact zero, while other gates gradually stay away from zero by a large margin.
When training terminates, those zero-gated channels can be painlessly removed,
while other non-zero gates can be absorbed into the succeeding convolution
kernel, causing completely no interruption to training nor damage to the
trained model. Experiments conducted over CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets show
that the proposed GDP algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance on
various benchmark DNNs at a broad range of pruning ratios. We also apply GDP to
DeepLabV3Plus-ResNet50 on the challenging Pascal VOC segmentation task, whose
test performance sees no drop (even slightly improved) with over 60% FLOPs
saving.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM) has been a popular
algorithmic framework for separable optimization problems with linear
constraints. For numerical ADMM fail to exploit the particular structure of the
problem at hand nor the input data information, leveraging task-specific
modules (e.g., neural networks and other data-driven architectures) to extend
ADMM is a significant but challenging task. This work focuses on designing a
flexible algorithmic framework to incorporate various task-specific modules
(with no additional constraints) to improve the performance of ADMM in
real-world applications. Specifically, we propose Guidance from Optimality
(GO), a new customization strategy, to embed task-specific modules into ADMM
(GO-ADMM). By introducing an optimality-based criterion to guide the
propagation, GO-ADMM establishes an updating scheme agnostic to the choice of
additional modules. The existing task-specific methods just plug their
task-specific modules into the numerical iterations in a straightforward
manner. Even with some restrictive constraints on the plug-in modules, they can
only obtain some relatively weaker convergence properties for the resulted ADMM
iterations. Fortunately, without any restrictions on the embedded modules, we
prove the convergence of GO-ADMM regarding objective values and constraint
violations, and derive the worst-case convergence rate measured by iteration
complexity. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical
results and demonstrate the efficiency of GO-ADMM.]]></summary>

Recent studies propose supervised PQ, where the embedding and quantization
models can be jointly trained with supervised learning. However, there is a
lack of appropriate formulation of the joint training objective; thus, the
improvements over previous non-supervised baselines are limited in reality. In
this work, we propose the Matching-oriented Product Quantization (MoPQ), where
a novel objective Multinoulli Contrastive Loss (MCL) is formulated. With the
minimization of MCL, we are able to maximize the matching probability of query
and ground-truth key, which contributes to the optimal retrieval accuracy.
Given that the exact computation of MCL is intractable due to the demand of
vast contrastive samples, we further propose the Differentiable Cross-device
Sampling (DCS), which significantly augments the contrastive samples for
precise approximation of MCL. We conduct extensive experimental studies on four
real-world datasets, whose results verify the effectiveness of MoPQ.]]></summary>

generation, which leads to unrealistic video results. To tackle this problem,
we propose a model named FGLA to generate high-quality and realistic videos by

consists of two parts: (1) a motion encoder which embeds time-lapse motion in a
fine-grained way. (2) a motion generator which generates realistic motion to
animate input images. To train and evaluate on diverse time-lapse videos, we
build the largest high-resolution Time-lapse video dataset with Diverse scenes,
namely Time-lapse-D, which includes 16,874 video clips with over 10 million

completion problem and proposes a new multi-layer neural network architecture
for tensor factorization and completion (MLCTR). The network architecture
entails multiple advantages: a series of low-rank matrix factorizations (MF)
building blocks to minimize overfitting, interleaved transfer functions in each
layer for non-linearity, and by-pass connections to reduce the gradient
diminishing problem and increase the depths of neural networks. Furthermore,
the model employs Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) based optimization for fast
convergence in training. Our algorithm is highly efficient for imputing missing
values in the EPS data. Experiments confirm that our strategy of incorporating
non-linearity in factor matrices demonstrates impressive performance in
embedding learning and end-to-end tensor models, and outperforms approaches
with non-linearity in the phase of reconstructing tensors from factor matrices.]]></summary>

challenges to current ensemble clustering research. To deal with the curse of
dimensionality, recently considerable efforts in ensemble clustering have been
made by means of different subspace-based techniques. However, besides the
emphasis on subspaces, rather limited attention has been paid to the potential
diversity in similarity/dissimilarity metrics. It remains a surprisingly open
problem in ensemble clustering how to create and aggregate a large population
of diversified metrics, and furthermore, how to jointly investigate the
multi-level diversity in the large populations of metrics, subspaces, and
clusters in a unified framework. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a
novel multidiversified ensemble clustering approach. In particular, we create a
large number of diversified metrics by randomizing a scaled exponential
similarity kernel, which are then coupled with random subspaces to form a large
set of metric-subspace pairs. Based on the similarity matrices derived from
these metric-subspace pairs, an ensemble of diversified base clusterings can
thereby be constructed. Further, an entropy-based criterion is utilized to
explore the cluster-wise diversity in ensembles, based on which three specific
ensemble clustering algorithms are presented by incorporating three types of
consensus functions. Extensive experiments are conducted on 30 high-dimensional
datasets, including 18 cancer gene expression datasets and 12 image/speech
datasets, which demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms over the
state-of-the-art. The source code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the Domain Generalization (DG) problem where the hypotheses are composed
of a common representation function followed by a labeling function, we point
out a shortcoming in existing approaches that fail to explicitly optimize for a
term, appearing in a well-known and widely adopted upper bound to the risk on
the unseen domain, that is dependent on the representation to be learned. To
this end, we first derive a novel upper bound to the prediction risk. We show
that imposing a mild assumption on the representation to be learned, namely
manifold restricted invertibility, is sufficient to deal with this issue.
Further, unlike existing approaches, our novel upper bound doesn't require the
assumption of Lipschitzness of the loss function. In addition, the
distributional discrepancy in the representation space is handled via the
Wasserstein-2 barycenter cost. In this context, we creatively leverage old and
recent transport inequalities, which link various optimal transport metrics, in
particular the $L^1$ distance (also known as the total variation distance) and
the Wasserstein-2 distances, with the Kullback-Liebler divergence. These
analyses and insights motivate a new representation learning cost for DG that
additively balances three competing objectives: 1) minimizing classification
error across seen domains via cross-entropy, 2) enforcing domain-invariance in
the representation space via the Wasserstein-2 barycenter cost, and 3)
promoting non-degenerate, nearly-invertible representation via one of two
mechanisms, viz., an autoencoder-based reconstruction loss or a mutual
information loss. It is to be noted that the proposed algorithms completely
bypass the use of any adversarial training mechanism that is typical of many
current domain generalization approaches. Simulation results on several
standard datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to several
well-known DG algorithms.]]></summary>

suitable for real-time odometry applications. The square root formulation
pervades three major aspects of our optimization-based sliding-window
estimator: for bundle adjustment we eliminate landmark variables with nullspace
projection; to store the marginalization prior we employ a matrix square root
of the Hessian; and when marginalizing old poses we avoid forming normal
equations and update the square root prior directly with a specialized QR
decomposition. We show that the proposed square root marginalization is
algebraically equivalent to the conventional use of Schur complement (SC) on
the Hessian. Moreover, it elegantly deals with rank-deficient Jacobians
producing a prior equivalent to SC with Moore-Penrose inverse. Our evaluation
of visual and visual-inertial odometry on real-world datasets demonstrates that
the proposed estimator is 36% faster than the baseline. It furthermore shows
that in single precision, conventional Hessian-based marginalization leads to
numeric failures and reduced accuracy. We analyse numeric properties of the
marginalization prior to explain why our square root form does not suffer from
the same effect and therefore entails superior performance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Relation Extraction (RE) from tables is the task of identifying relations
between pairs of columns of a table. Generally, RE models for this task require
labelled tables for training. These labelled tables can also be generated
artificially from a Knowledge Graph (KG), which makes the cost to acquire them
much lower in comparison to manual annotations. However, unlike real tables,
these synthetic tables lack associated metadata, such as, column-headers,
captions, etc; this is because synthetic tables are created out of KGs that do
not store such metadata. Meanwhile, previous works have shown that metadata is
important for accurate RE from tables. To address this issue, we propose
methods to artificially create some of this metadata for synthetic tables.
Afterward, we experiment with a BERT-based model, in line with recently
published works, that takes as input a combination of proposed artificial
metadata and table content. Our empirical results show that this leads to an
improvement of 9\%-45\% in F1 score, in absolute terms, over 2 tabular
datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Visual emotion analysis (VEA) has attracted great attention recently, due to
the increasing tendency of expressing and understanding emotions through images
on social networks. Different from traditional vision tasks, VEA is inherently
more challenging since it involves a much higher level of complexity and
ambiguity in human cognitive process. Most of the existing methods adopt deep
learning techniques to extract general features from the whole image,
disregarding the specific features evoked by various emotional stimuli.
Inspired by the \textit{Stimuli-Organism-Response (S-O-R)} emotion model in
psychological theory, we proposed a stimuli-aware VEA method consisting of
three stages, namely stimuli selection (S), feature extraction (O) and emotion
prediction (R). First, specific emotional stimuli (i.e., color, object, face)
are selected from images by employing the off-the-shelf tools. To the best of
our knowledge, it is the first time to introduce stimuli selection process into
VEA in an end-to-end network. Then, we design three specific networks, i.e.,
Global-Net, Semantic-Net and Expression-Net, to extract distinct emotional
features from different stimuli simultaneously. Finally, benefiting from the
inherent structure of Mikel's wheel, we design a novel hierarchical
cross-entropy loss to distinguish hard false examples from easy ones in an
emotion-specific manner. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on four public visual
emotion datasets. Ablation study and visualizations further prove the validity
and interpretability of our method.]]></summary>

in distribution to the training data. In an ideal case, Deep Learning models
would achieve Out-of-Distribution (OoD) Generalization, i.e. reliably make

to generalize well when facing a shift in distribution. Several methods were
thereby designed to improve the robustness of the features learned by a model
through Regularization- or Domain-Prediction-based schemes. Segmenting medical
images such as MRIs of the hippocampus is essential for the diagnosis and
treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. But these brain images often suffer
from distribution shift due to the patient's age and various pathologies
affecting the shape of the organ. In this work, we evaluate OoD Generalization
solutions for the problem of hippocampus segmentation in MR data using both
fully- and semi-supervised training. We find that no method performs reliably

and output asynchronous event streams with high dynamic range and less motion
blur. It has been shown that events alone can be used for end-task learning,
\eg, semantic segmentation, based on encoder-decoder-like networks. However, as
events are sparse and mostly reflect edge information, it is difficult to
recover original details merely relying on the decoder. Moreover, most methods
resort to pixel-wise loss alone for supervision, which might be insufficient to
fully exploit the visual details from sparse events, thus leading to less
optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet flexible two-stream
framework named Dual Transfer Learning (DTL) to effectively enhance the
performance on the end-tasks without adding extra inference cost. The proposed
approach consists of three parts: event to end-task learning (EEL) branch,
event to image translation (EIT) branch, and transfer learning (TL) module that
simultaneously explores the feature-level affinity information and pixel-level
knowledge from the EIT branch to improve the EEL branch. This simple yet novel
method leads to strong representation learning from events and is evidenced by
the significant performance boost on the end-tasks such as semantic
segmentation and depth estimation.]]></summary>

diagnosis. Although previous attempts to classify sleep stages have achieved
high classification performance, several challenges remain open: 1) How to
effectively utilize time-varying spatial and temporal features from
multi-channel brain signals remains challenging. Prior works have not been able
to fully utilize the spatial topological information among brain regions. 2)
Due to the many differences found in individual biological signals, how to
overcome the differences of subjects and improve the generalization of deep
neural networks is important. 3) Most deep learning methods ignore the
interpretability of the model to the brain. To address the above challenges, we
propose a multi-view spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks (MSTGCN)
with domain generalization for sleep stage classification. Specifically, we
construct two brain view graphs for MSTGCN based on the functional connectivity
and physical distance proximity of the brain regions. The MSTGCN consists of
graph convolutions for extracting spatial features and temporal convolutions
for capturing the transition rules among sleep stages. In addition, attention
mechanism is employed for capturing the most relevant spatial-temporal
information for sleep stage classification. Finally, domain generalization and
MSTGCN are integrated into a unified framework to extract subject-invariant
sleep features. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that the
proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.]]></summary>

including augmented reality (AR). However, this requires not only real-time
speed and accurate hand pose and shape but also plausible mesh-image alignment.
While existing works already achieve promising results, meeting all three
requirements is very challenging. This paper presents a novel pipeline by
decoupling the hand-mesh reconstruction task into three stages: a joint stage
to predict hand joints and segmentation; a mesh stage to predict a rough hand
mesh; and a refine stage to fine-tune it with an offset mesh for mesh-image
alignment. With careful design in the network structure and in the loss
functions, we can promote high-quality finger-level mesh-image alignment and
drive the models together to deliver real-time predictions. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
quality of our results outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on
hand-mesh/pose precision and hand-image alignment. In the end, we also showcase
several real-time AR scenarios.]]></summary>

single image, and then rendered from new viewpoints or their shape and texture

tasks is a widely observed limitation of contemporary neural networks. Although
many continual learning methods are proposed to mitigate this drawback, the
main question remains unanswered: what is the root cause of catastrophic
forgetting? In this work, we aim at answering this question by posing and
validating a set of research hypotheses related to the specificity of
representations built internally by neural models. More specifically, we design
a set of empirical evaluations that compare the robustness of representations
in discriminative and generative models against catastrophic forgetting. We
observe that representations learned by discriminative models are more prone to
catastrophic forgetting than their generative counterparts, which sheds new
light on the advantages of developing generative models for continual learning.
Finally, our work opens new research pathways and possibilities to adopt
generative models in continual learning beyond mere replay mechanisms.]]></summary>

automatically extracts categorical and numerical parameters such as (i) the
plant species from which active molecules are extracted, (ii) the
microorganisms species for which active molecules can act against, and (iii)
the values of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against these
microorganisms. The parameters are extracted without part-of-speech tagging
(POS) and named entity recognition (NER) approaches (i.e. without the need of
text annotation), and the models training is performed with unsupervised
approaches. In this way, a.RIX can be essentially used on articles from any

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Personalized video highlight detection aims to shorten a long video to
interesting moments according to a user's preference, which has recently raised
the community's attention. Current methods regard the user's history as
holistic information to predict the user's preference but negating the inherent
diversity of the user's interests, resulting in vague preference
representation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient preference
reasoning framework (PR-Net) to explicitly take the diverse interests into
account for frame-level highlight prediction. Specifically, distinct
user-specific preferences for each input query frame are produced, presented as
the similarity weighted sum of history highlights to the corresponding query
frame. Next, distinct comprehensive preferences are formed by the user-specific
preferences and a learnable generic preference for more overall highlight
measurement. Lastly, the degree of highlight and non-highlight for each query
frame is calculated as semantic similarity to its comprehensive and
non-highlight preferences, respectively. Besides, to alleviate the ambiguity
due to the incomplete annotation, a new bi-directional contrastive loss is
proposed to ensure a compact and differentiable metric space. In this way, our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a relative
improvement of 12% in mean accuracy precision.]]></summary>

range of professional medical services, i.e., diagnosis, consultation, and
treatment. However, one-stop MDS is still unexplored because: (1) no dataset
has so large-scale dialogues contains both multiple medical services and
fine-grained medical labels (i.e., intents, slots, values); (2) no model has
addressed a MDS based on multiple-service conversations in a unified framework.
In this work, we first build a Multiple-domain Multiple-service medical
dialogue (M^2-MedDialog)dataset, which contains 1,557 conversations between
doctors and patients, covering 276 types of diseases, 2,468 medical entities,
and 3 specialties of medical services. To the best of our knowledge, it is the
only medical dialogue dataset that includes both multiple medical services and
fine-grained medical labels. Then, we formulate a one-stop MDS as a
sequence-to-sequence generation problem. We unify a MDS with causal language
modeling and conditional causal language modeling, respectively. Specifically,
we employ several pretrained models (i.e., BERT-WWM, BERT-MED, GPT2, and MT5)
and their variants to get benchmarks on M^2-MedDialog dataset. We also propose
pseudo labeling and natural perturbation methods to expand M2-MedDialog dataset
and enhance the state-of-the-art pretrained models. We demonstrate the results
achieved by the benchmarks so far through extensive experiments on
M2-MedDialog. We release the dataset, the code, as well as the evaluation
scripts to facilitate future research in this important research direction.]]></summary>

employ recommender systems in their online businesses, e.g., personalized
purchase prediction of shopping baskets. While most previous techniques have
focused on leveraging a user's history, the study of combining it with others'
histories remains untapped potential. This paper proposes Global-Local Item
Embedding (GLOIE) that learns to utilize the temporal properties of sets across
whole users as well as within a user by coining the names as global and local
information to distinguish the two temporal patterns. GLOIE uses Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) and dynamic graph-based model to capture global and local
information and then applies attention to integrate resulting item embeddings.
Additionally, we propose to use Tweedie output for the decoder of VAE as it can
easily model zero-inflated and long-tailed distribution, which is more suitable
for several real-world data distributions than Gaussian or multinomial
counterparts. When evaluated on three public benchmarks, our algorithm
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in most ranking

operators and nonlinear activation functions, so that the composed operator can

theorem for our construction. Furthermore, we introduce four classes of
operator parameterizations: graph-based operators, low-rank operators,
multipole graph-based operators, and Fourier operators and describe efficient
algorithms for computing with each one. The proposed neural operators are
resolution-invariant: they share the same network parameters between different
discretizations of the underlying function spaces and can be used for zero-shot
super-resolutions. Numerically, the proposed models show superior performance
compared to existing machine learning based methodologies on Burgers' equation,
Darcy flow, and the Navier-Stokes equation, while being several order of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rapid recent progress in machine learning (ML) has raised a number of
scientific questions that challenge the longstanding dogma of the field. One of
the most important riddles is the good empirical generalization of
overparameterized models. Overparameterized models are excessively complex with
respect to the size of the training dataset, which results in them perfectly
fitting (i.e., interpolating) the training data, which is usually noisy. Such
interpolation of noisy data is traditionally associated with detrimental
overfitting, and yet a wide range of interpolating models -- from simple linear
models to deep neural networks -- have recently been observed to generalize
extremely well on fresh test data. Indeed, the recently discovered double
descent phenomenon has revealed that highly overparameterized models often
improve over the best underparameterized model in test performance.

Understanding learning in this overparameterized regime requires new theory
and foundational empirical studies, even for the simplest case of the linear
model. The underpinnings of this understanding have been laid in very recent
analyses of overparameterized linear regression and related statistical
learning tasks, which resulted in precise analytic characterizations of double
descent. This paper provides a succinct overview of this emerging theory of
overparameterized ML (henceforth abbreviated as TOPML) that explains these
recent findings through a statistical signal processing perspective. We
emphasize the unique aspects that define the TOPML research area as a subfield
of modern ML theory and outline interesting open questions that remain.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is notoriously difficult to control the behavior of reinforcement learning
agents. Agents often learn to exploit the environment or reward signal and need
to be retrained multiple times. The multi-objective reinforcement learning
(MORL) framework separates a reward function into several objectives. An ideal
MORL agent learns to generalize to novel combinations of objectives allowing
for better control of an agent's behavior without requiring retraining. Many
MORL approaches use a weight vector to parameterize the importance of each
objective. However, this approach suffers from lack of expressiveness and
interpretability. We propose using propositional logic to specify the
importance of multiple objectives. By using a logic where predicates correspond
directly to objectives, specifications are inherently more interpretable.
Additionally the set of specifications that can be expressed with formal
languages is a superset of what can be expressed by weight vectors. In this
paper, we define a formal language based on propositional logic with
quantitative semantics. We encode logical specifications using a recurrent
neural network and show that MORL agents parameterized by these encodings are
able to generalize to novel specifications over objectives and achieve
performance comparable to single objective baselines.]]></summary>

the omnipresent sensing systems (or IoT in general) has numerous applications
in diverse use cases. Existing purely supervised end-to-end deep learning
techniques depend on the availability of a massive amount of well-curated data,
acquiring which is notoriously difficult but required to achieve a sufficient
level of generalization on a task of interest. In this work, we leverage the
self-supervised learning paradigm towards realizing the vision of continual
learning from unlabeled inputs. We present a generalized framework named Sense
and Learn for representation or feature learning from raw sensory data. It
consists of several auxiliary tasks that can learn high-level and broadly
useful features entirely from unannotated data without any human involvement in
the tedious labeling process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on
several publicly available datasets from different domains and in various
settings, including linear separability, semi-supervised or few shot learning,
and transfer learning. Our methodology achieves results that are competitive
with the supervised approaches and close the gap through fine-tuning a network
while learning the downstream tasks in most cases. In particular, we show that
the self-supervised network can be utilized as initialization to significantly
boost the performance in a low-data regime with as few as 5 labeled instances
per class, which is of high practical importance to real-world problems.
Likewise, the learned representations with self-supervision are found to be
highly transferable between related datasets, even when few labeled instances
are available from the target domains. The self-learning nature of our
methodology opens up exciting possibilities for on-device continual learning.]]></summary>

perspective of GANs leads to a GAN-based computational method (MFGANs) to solve
MFGs: one neural network for the backward Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and
one neural network for the forward Fokker-Planck equation, with the two neural
networks trained in an adversarial way. Numerical experiments demonstrate
superior performance of this proposed algorithm, especially in the higher
dimensional case, when compared with existing neural network approaches.]]></summary>

applications, such as market research and situational awareness. We identify
two lines of approaches to the problem of opinion prediction. One uses
topic-based sentiment analysis with time-series modeling, while the other uses
static embedding of text. The latter approaches seek user-specific solutions by
generating user fingerprints. Such approaches are useful in predicting user's
reactions to unseen content. In this work, we propose a novel dynamic
fingerprinting method that leverages contextual embedding of user's comments
conditioned on relevant user's reading history. We integrate BERT variants with
a recurrent neural network to generate predictions. The results show up to 13\%
improvement in micro F1-score compared to previous approaches. Experimental
results show novel insights that were previously unknown such as better
predictions for an increase in dynamic history length, the impact of the nature
of the article on performance, thereby laying the foundation for further
research.]]></summary>

forums. However, there still exists invalid comments which are not informative
for users. Moreover, those comments are also quite toxic and harmful to people.
In this paper, we create a dataset for constructive and toxic speech detection,
named UIT-ViCTSD (Vietnamese Constructive and Toxic Speech Detection dataset)
with 10,000 human-annotated comments. For these tasks, we propose a system for
constructive and toxic speech detection with the state-of-the-art transfer
learning model in Vietnamese NLP as PhoBERT. With this system, we obtain
F1-scores of 78.59% and 59.40% for classifying constructive and toxic comments,
respectively. Besides, we implement various baseline models as traditional
Machine Learning and Deep Neural Network-Based models to evaluate the dataset.
With the results, we can solve several tasks on the online discussions and
develop the framework for identifying constructiveness and toxicity of
Vietnamese social media comments automatically.]]></summary>

of combinatorial optimization tasks that have natural encodings as Ising
models. However, recent experiments on QA hardware platforms have demonstrated
that, in the operating regime corresponding to weak interactions, the QA
hardware behaves like a noisy Gibbs sampler at a hardware-specific effective
temperature. This work builds on those insights and identifies a class of small
hardware-native Ising models that are robust to noise effects and proposes a
novel procedure for executing these models on QA hardware to maximize Gibbs
sampling performance. Experimental results indicate that the proposed protocol
results in high-quality Gibbs samples from a hardware-specific effective
temperature and that the QA annealing time can be used to adjust the effective
temperature of the output distribution. The procedure proposed in this work
provides a new approach to using QA hardware for Ising model sampling
presenting potential new opportunities for applications in machine learning and

identify named entities from user queries as diverse surface form attribute
values and afterward transform them into formally canonical forms. Such a
problem consists of two phases: {named entity recognition (NER)} and {attribute
value normalization (AVN)}. However, existing works only focus on the NER phase
but neglect equally important AVN. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a
unified query attribute value extraction system in e-commerce search named
QUEACO, which involves both two phases. Moreover, by leveraging large-scale
weakly-labeled behavior data, we further improve the extraction performance
with less supervision cost. Specifically, for the NER phase, QUEACO adopts a
novel teacher-student network, where a teacher network that is trained on the
strongly-labeled data generates pseudo-labels to refine the weakly-labeled data
for training a student network. Meanwhile, the teacher network can be
dynamically adapted by the feedback of the student's performance on
strongly-labeled data to maximally denoise the noisy supervisions from the weak
labels. For the AVN phase, we also leverage the weakly-labeled
query-to-attribute behavior data to normalize surface form attribute values
from queries into canonical forms from products. Extensive experiments on a
real-world large-scale E-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
QUEACO.]]></summary>

object shapes and textures across a category and can be trained, from a set of
posed images, to synthesize novel views of unseen objects. Unlike the original
NeRF, which is scene specific, CodeNeRF learns to disentangle shape and texture
by learning separate embeddings. At test time, given a single unposed image of
an unseen object, CodeNeRF jointly estimates camera viewpoint, and shape and
appearance codes via optimization. Unseen objects can be reconstructed from a
single image, and then rendered from new viewpoints or their shape and texture
edited by varying the latent codes. We conduct experiments on the SRN
benchmark, which show that CodeNeRF generalises well to unseen objects and
achieves on-par performance with methods that require known camera pose at test

introduce hypergraph to the framework of NTR to further enhance the feature
extraction, upon which a hypergraph regularized nonnegative tensor ring

complexity and suppress the noise, we apply the low-rank approximation trick to
accelerate HGNTR (called LraHGNTR). Our experimental results show that compared

success in recent years. However, these models didn't consider the
personalization issue of segmentation though it is important in practice. In
this paper, we address the problem of personalized image segmentation. The
objective is to generate more accurate segmentation results on unlabeled
personalized images by investigating the data's personalized traits. To open up
future research in this area, we collect a large dataset containing various
users' personalized images called PIS (Personalized Image Semantic
Segmentation). We also survey some recent researches related to this problem
and report their performance on our dataset. Furthermore, by observing the
correlation among a user's personalized images, we propose a baseline method
that incorporates the inter-image context when segmenting certain images.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the existing methods on
the proposed dataset. The code and the PIS dataset will be made publicly
available.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Biomedical entity linking is the task of linking entity mentions in a
biomedical document to referent entities in a knowledge base. Recently, many
BERT-based models have been introduced for the task. While these models have
achieved competitive results on many datasets, they are computationally
expensive and contain about 110M parameters. Little is known about the factors
contributing to their impressive performance and whether the
over-parameterization is needed. In this work, we shed some light on the inner
working mechanisms of these large BERT-based models. Through a set of probing
experiments, we have found that the entity linking performance only changes
slightly when the input word order is shuffled or when the attention scope is
limited to a fixed window size. From these observations, we propose an
efficient convolutional neural network with residual connections for biomedical
entity linking. Because of the sparse connectivity and weight sharing
properties, our model has a small number of parameters and is highly efficient.
On five public datasets, our model achieves comparable or even better linking
accuracy than the state-of-the-art BERT-based models while having about 60
times fewer parameters.]]></summary>

applications over large-scale networks. To alleviate the communication burden,
sign-based optimization algorithms have gained popularity recently in both
industrial and academic communities, which is shown to be closely related to
adaptive gradient methods, such as Adam. Along this line, this paper
investigates faster convergence for a variant of sign-based gradient descent,
called scaled signGD, in three cases: 1) the objective function is strongly
convex; 2) the objective function is nonconvex but satisfies the
Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequality; 3) the gradient is stochastic, called
scaled signGD in this case. For the first two cases, it can be shown that the
scaled signGD converges at a linear rate. For case 3), the algorithm is shown
to converge linearly to a neighborhood of the optimal value when a constant
learning rate is employed, and the algorithm converges at a rate of $O(1/k)$
when using a diminishing learning rate, where $k$ is the iteration number. The
results are also extended to the distributed setting by majority vote in a
parameter-server framework. Finally, numerical experiments on logistic
regression are performed to corroborate the theoretical findings.]]></summary>

have gradually become the code-base of building stronger artificial
intelligence(AI). The RL algorithm design firstly needs to adapt to the
specific environment, so the designed environment guides the rapid and profound
development of RL algorithms. However, the existing environments, which can be
divided into real world games and customized toy environments, have obvious
shortcomings. For real world games, it is designed for human entertainment, and
too much difficult for most of RL researchers. For customized toy environments,
there is no widely accepted unified evaluation standard for all RL algorithms.
Therefore, we introduce the first virtual user-friendly environment framework
for RL. In this framework, the environment can be easily configured to realize
all kinds of RL tasks in the mainstream research. Then all the mainstream
state-of-the-art(SOTA) RL algorithms can be conveniently evaluated and
compared. Therefore, our contributions mainly includes the following aspects:
1.single configured environment for all classification of SOTA RL algorithms;
2.combined environment of more than one classification RL algorithms; 3.the
evaluation standard for all kinds of RL algorithms. With all these efforts, a
possibility for breeding an AI with capability of general competency in a

tasks is a widely observed limitation of contemporary neural networks. Although
many continual learning methods are proposed to mitigate this drawback, the
main question remains unanswered: what is the root cause of catastrophic
forgetting? In this work, we aim at answering this question by posing and
validating a set of research hypotheses related to the specificity of
representations built internally by neural models. More specifically, we design
a set of empirical evaluations that compare the robustness of representations
in discriminative and generative models against catastrophic forgetting. We
observe that representations learned by discriminative models are more prone to
catastrophic forgetting than their generative counterparts, which sheds new
light on the advantages of developing generative models for continual learning.
Finally, our work opens new research pathways and possibilities to adopt
generative models in continual learning beyond mere replay mechanisms.]]></summary>

sentences in a randomly ordered document. Correctly ordering the sentences
requires an understanding of coherence with respect to the chronological

essential in uncovering this coherence and predicting the exact chronological
order. In this paper, we introduce STaCK -- a framework based on graph neural

predict the relative order of sentences. Our graph network accumulates temporal
evidence using knowledge of `past' and `future' and formulates sentence
ordering as a constrained edge classification problem. We report results on
five different datasets, and empirically show that the proposed method is
naturally suitable for order prediction. The implementation of this work is

systems: there is indeed inconsistency between training and testing.
Constructing a high-quality co-saliency detection dataset involves
time-consuming and labor-intensive pixel-level labeling, which has forced most
recent works to rely instead on semantic segmentation or saliency detection
datasets for training. However, the lack of proper co-saliency and the absence
of multiple foreground objects in these datasets can lead to spurious
variations and inherent biases learned by models. To tackle this, we introduce
the idea of counterfactual training through context adjustment, and propose a
"cost-free" group-cut-paste (GCP) procedure to leverage images from
off-the-shelf saliency detection datasets and synthesize new samples. Following
GCP, we collect a novel dataset called Context Adjustment Training (CAT). CAT
consists of 33,500 images, making it four times larger than the current
co-saliency detection datasets. All images are automatically annotated with
high-quality mask annotations, object categories, and edge maps. Extensive
experiments with state-of-the-art models are conducted to demonstrate the
superiority of our dataset. We hope that the scale, diversity, and quality of
our dataset can benefit researchers in this area and beyond. The dataset and

extraction from medical images with a wide array of applications in clinical
practice, such as clinical decision support in oncology. However, noise in low
dose computed tomography (CT) scans can impair the accurate extraction of
radiomic features. In this article, we investigate the possibility of using
deep learning generative models to improve the performance of radiomics from
low dose CTs. We used two datasets of low dose CT scans -NSCLC Radiogenomics
and LIDC-IDRI - as test datasets for two tasks - pre-treatment survival
prediction and lung cancer diagnosis. We used encoder-decoder networks and
conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) trained in a previous study
as generative models to transform low dose CT images into full dose CT images.
Radiomic features extracted from the original and improved CT scans were used
to build two classifiers - a support vector machine (SVM) and a deep attention
based multiple instance learning model - for survival prediction and lung
cancer diagnosis respectively. Finally, we compared the performance of the
models derived from the original and improved CT scans. Encoder-decoder
networks and CGANs improved the area under the curve (AUC) of survival
prediction from 0.52 to 0.57 (p-value<0.01). On the other hand, Encoder-decoder
network and CGAN can improve the AUC of lung cancer diagnosis from 0.84 to 0.88
and 0.89 respectively (p-value<0.01). Moreover, there are no statistically
significant differences in improving AUC by using encoder-decoder network and
CGAN (p-value=0.34) when networks trained at 75 and 100 epochs. Generative
models can improve the performance of low dose CT-based radiomics in different
tasks. Hence, denoising using generative models seems to be a necessary
pre-processing step for calculating radiomic features from low dose CTs.]]></summary>

Nevertheless, registration of multi-modal images remains challenging, chiefly
due to the entirely different image contrast rendered by these modalities.
Previously reported registration algorithms mostly relied on manual
user-dependent brain segmentation, which compromised data interpretation and
accurate quantification. Here we propose a fully automated registration method
for MSOT-MRI multimodal imaging empowered by deep learning. The automated
workflow includes neural network-based image segmentation to generate suitable
masks, which are subsequently registered using an additional neural network.
Performance of the algorithm is showcased with datasets acquired by
cross-sectional MSOT and high-field MRI preclinical scanners. The automated

physiological changes. Nonetheless during dynamic MRI, while achieving a high
temporal resolution, the spatial resolution is compromised. To overcome this
spatio-temporal trade-off, this research presents a super-resolution (SR) MRI
reconstruction with prior knowledge based fine-tuning to maximise spatial
information while reducing the required scan-time for dynamic MRIs. An U-Net
based network with perceptual loss is trained on a benchmark dataset and
fine-tuned using one subject-specific static high resolution MRI as prior
knowledge to obtain high resolution dynamic images during the inference stage.
3D dynamic data for three subjects were acquired with different parameters to
test the generalisation capabilities of the network. The method was tested for
different levels of in-plane undersampling for dynamic MRI. The reconstructed
dynamic SR results after fine-tuning showed higher similarity with the high
resolution ground-truth, while quantitatively achieving statistically
significant improvement. The average SSIM of the lowest resolution experimented
during this research (6.25~\% of the k-space) before and after fine-tuning were
0.939 $\pm$ 0.008 and 0.957 $\pm$ 0.006 respectively. This could theoretically
result in an acceleration factor of 16, which can potentially be acquired in
less than half a second. The proposed approach shows that the super-resolution
MRI reconstruction with prior-information can alleviate the spatio-temporal
trade-off in dynamic MRI, even for high acceleration factors.]]></summary>

models trained on a certain source domain and hope to directly apply the most
appropriate ones to different target domains based on the models' relative
performance. Ideally we should annotate a validation set for model performance
assessment on each new target environment, but such annotations are often very
expensive. Under this circumstance, we introduce the problem of ranking models
in unlabeled new environments. For this problem, we propose to adopt a proxy
dataset that 1) is fully labeled and 2) well reflects the true model rankings
in a given target environment, and use the performance rankings on the proxy
sets as surrogates. We first select labeled datasets as the proxy.
Specifically, datasets that are more similar to the unlabeled target domain are
found to better preserve the relative performance rankings. Motivated by this,
we further propose to search the proxy set by sampling images from various
datasets that have similar distributions as the target. We analyze the problem
and its solutions on the person re-identification (re-ID) task, for which
sufficient datasets are publicly available, and show that a carefully
constructed proxy set effectively captures relative performance ranking in new
environments. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/sxzrt/Proxy-Set}.]]></summary>

taking model complexity into account. However, designing of the search space
suitable for specific hardware is still a challenging task. To address this
problem we propose a measure of hardware efficiency of neural architecture
search space - matrix efficiency measure (MEM); a search space comprising of
hardware-efficient operations; a latency-aware scaling method; and ISyNet - a
set of architectures designed to be fast on the specialized neural processing

our daily lives, but also in the medical and rehabilitation fields. The
development of deep learning has also contributed to the advancement of human
activity recognition, but the large amount of data annotation work required to
train deep learning models is a major obstacle to the development of human
activity recognition. Contrastive learning has started to be used in the field
of sensor-based human activity recognition due to its ability to avoid the cost
of labeling large datasets and its ability to better distinguish between sample
representations of different instances. Among them, data augmentation, an
important part of contrast learning, has a significant impact on model
effectiveness, but current data augmentation methods do not perform too
successfully in contrast learning frameworks for wearable sensor-based activity
recognition. To optimize the effect of contrast learning models, in this paper,
we investigate the sampling frequency of sensors and propose a resampling data
augmentation method. In addition, we also propose a contrast learning framework
based on human activity recognition and apply the resampling augmentation
method to the data augmentation phase of contrast learning. The experimental
results show that the resampling augmentation method outperforms supervised
learning by 9.88% on UCI HAR and 7.69% on Motion Sensor in the fine-tuning
evaluation of contrast learning with a small amount of labeled data, and also
reveal that not all data augmentation methods will have positive effects in the
contrast learning framework. Finally, we explored the influence of the
combination of different augmentation methods on contrastive learning, and the
experimental results showed that the effect of most combination augmentation
methods was better than that of single augmentation.]]></summary>

severe social concerns and security problems. Existing methods for detecting
GAN-generated faces can perform well on limited public datasets. However,
images from existing public datasets do not represent real-world scenarios well
enough in terms of view variations and data distributions (where real faces
largely outnumber synthetic faces). The state-of-the-art methods do not
generalize well in real-world problems and lack the interpretability of
detection results. Performance of existing GAN-face detection models degrades
significantly when facing imbalanced data distributions. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a robust, attentive, end-to-end network that can spot
GAN-generated faces by analyzing their eye inconsistencies. Specifically, our
model learns to identify inconsistent eye components by localizing and
comparing the iris artifacts between the two eyes automatically. Our deep
network addresses the imbalance learning issues by considering the AUC loss and
the traditional cross-entropy loss jointly. Comprehensive evaluations of the
FFHQ dataset in terms of both balanced and imbalanced scenarios demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method.]]></summary>

in the fact that we make no assumptions about the input other than that it

access to 3D or pseudo 3D. In the process, we contribute towards a) a cheap yet
effective method to synthesise a sufficiently large high fidelity dataset,
pertinent to task; b) creating a pipeline with conditional generative

trade-off is one of the most common criteria. However, in reinforcement
learning (RL) for sequential decision making under uncertainty, most of the
existing methods for MV control suffer from computational difficulties caused
by the double sampling problem. In this paper, in contrast to strict MV
control, we consider learning MV efficient policies that achieve Pareto
efficiency regarding MV trade-off. To achieve this purpose, we train an agent
to maximize the expected quadratic utility function, a common objective of risk
management in finance and economics. We call our approach direct expected
quadratic utility maximization (EQUM). The EQUM does not suffer from the double
sampling issue because it does not include gradient estimation of variance. We
confirm that the maximizer of the objective in the EQUM directly corresponds to
an MV efficient policy under a certain condition. We conduct experiments with

can detect a sub-image with a relatively high concentration of information from
this Vietoris-Rips complex. The parameter $\varepsilon$ of the Vietoris-Rips

task due to its ill-posed nature. One approach is to utilize the plentiful
photos of the same object category to learn a strong 3D shape prior for the
object. This approach has successfully been demonstrated by a recent work of Wu
et al. (2020), which obtained impressive 3D reconstruction networks with
unsupervised learning. However, their algorithm is only applicable to symmetric
objects. In this paper, we eliminate the symmetry requirement with a novel
unsupervised algorithm that can learn a 3D reconstruction network from a
multi-image dataset. Our algorithm is more general and covers the
symmetry-required scenario as a special case. Besides, we employ a novel albedo
loss that improves the reconstructed details and realisticity. Our method
surpasses the previous work in both quality and robustness, as shown in
experiments on datasets of various structures, including single-view,
multi-view, image-collection, and video sets.]]></summary>

in the wild. In contrast to existing studies that mainly focus on parsing
well-aligned tabular images with simple layouts from scanned PDF documents, we
aim to establish a practical table structure parsing system for real-world
scenarios where tabular input images are taken or scanned with severe
deformation, bending or occlusions. For designing such a system, we propose an
approach named Cycle-CenterNet on the top of CenterNet with a novel
cycle-pairing module to simultaneously detect and group tabular cells into
structured tables. In the cycle-pairing module, a new pairing loss function is
proposed for the network training. Alongside with our Cycle-CenterNet, we also
present a large-scale dataset, named Wired Table in the Wild (WTW), which
includes well-annotated structure parsing of multiple style tables in several
scenes like the photo, scanning files, web pages, \emph{etc.}. In experiments,
we demonstrate that our Cycle-CenterNet consistently achieves the best accuracy
of table structure parsing on the new WTW dataset by 24.6\% absolute
improvement evaluated by the TEDS metric. A more comprehensive experimental
analysis also validates the advantages of our proposed methods for the TSP

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In practice, and more especially when training deep neural networks, visual
recognition rules are often learned based on various sources of information. On
the other hand, the recent deployment of facial recognition systems with uneven
predictive performances on different population segments highlights the
representativeness issues possibly induced by a naive aggregation of image
datasets. Indeed, sampling bias does not vanish simply by considering larger
datasets, and ignoring its impact may completely jeopardize the generalization
capacity of the learned prediction rules. In this paper, we show how biasing
models, originally introduced for nonparametric estimation in (Gill et al.,
1988), and recently revisited from the perspective of statistical learning
theory in (Laforgue and Cl\'emen\c{c}on, 2019), can be applied to remedy these
problems in the context of visual recognition. Based on the (approximate)
knowledge of the biasing mechanisms at work, our approach consists in
reweighting the observations, so as to form a nearly debiased estimator of the
target distribution. One key condition for our method to be theoretically valid
is that the supports of the distributions generating the biased datasets at
disposal must overlap, and cover the support of the target distribution. In
order to meet this requirement in practice, we propose to use a low dimensional
image representation, shared across the image databases. Finally, we provide
numerical experiments highlighting the relevance of our approach whenever the
biasing functions are appropriately chosen.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anomaly detection in computer vision is the task of identifying images which
deviate from a set of normal images. A common approach is to train deep
convolutional autoencoders to inpaint covered parts of an image and compare the
output with the original image. By training on anomaly-free samples only, the
model is assumed to not being able to reconstruct anomalous regions properly.
For anomaly detection by inpainting we suggest it to be beneficial to
incorporate information from potentially distant regions. In particular we pose
anomaly detection as a patch-inpainting problem and propose to solve it with a
purely self-attention based approach discarding convolutions. The proposed
Inpainting Transformer (InTra) is trained to inpaint covered patches in a large
sequence of image patches, thereby integrating information across large regions
of the input image. When training from scratch, in comparison to other methods
not using extra training data, InTra achieves results on par with the current
state-of-the-art on the MVTec AD dataset for detection and surpassing them on

design a network based on the transformer for fusing the low-resolution
hyperspectral images and high-resolution multispectral images to obtain the
high-resolution hyperspectral images. Thanks to the representing ability of the
transformer, our approach is able to explore the intrinsic relationships of
features globally. Furthermore, considering the LR-HSIs hold the main spectral
structure, the network focuses on the spatial detail estimation releasing from
the burden of reconstructing the whole data. It reduces the mapping space of

analysis, which is widely used in many 3D applications. However, existing
methods cannot simultaneously capture the relations at multiple levels,

make accurate predictions in some hard scenarios when there is cluttered
background, occlusion, or extreme pose. To this end, we propose Multi-level
Attention Encoder-Decoder Network (MAED), including a Spatial-Temporal Encoder
(STE) and a Kinematic Topology Decoder (KTD) to model multi-level attentions in
a unified framework. STE consists of a series of cascaded blocks based on
Multi-Head Self-Attention, and each block uses two parallel branches to learn
spatial and temporal attention respectively. Meanwhile, KTD aims at modeling
the joint level attention. It regards pose estimation as a top-down
hierarchical process similar to SMPL kinematic tree. With the training set of
3DPW, MAED outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 6.2, 7.2, and 2.4

"How should the network learn a variable number of bounding boxes in different

density estimation of bounding boxes. Instead of assigning each ground truth to
specific locations of network's output, we train a network by estimating the
probability density of bounding boxes in an input image using a mixture model.
For this purpose, we propose a novel network for object detection called
Mixture Density Object Detector (MDOD), and the corresponding objective
function for the density-estimation-based training. We applied MDOD to MS COCO

resulting weight-space ensembles provide large accuracy improvements
out-of-distribution, while matching or improving in-distribution accuracy. On
ImageNet and five derived distribution shifts, weight-space ensembles improve

adaptive fusion mechanism is proposed to further improve small object detection
performance. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using only a model that was trained to predict where people look at images,
and no additional training data, we can produce a range of powerful editing
effects for reducing distraction in images. Given an image and a mask
specifying the region to edit, we backpropagate through a state-of-the-art
saliency model to parameterize a differentiable editing operator, such that the
saliency within the masked region is reduced. We demonstrate several operators,
including: a recoloring operator, which learns to apply a color transform that
camouflages and blends distractors into their surroundings; a warping operator,
which warps less salient image regions to cover distractors, gradually
collapsing objects into themselves and effectively removing them (an effect
akin to inpainting); a GAN operator, which uses a semantic prior to fully
replace image regions with plausible, less salient alternatives. The resulting
effects are consistent with cognitive research on the human visual system
(e.g., since color mismatch is salient, the recoloring operator learns to
harmonize objects' colors with their surrounding to reduce their saliency),
and, importantly, are all achieved solely through the guidance of the
pretrained saliency model, with no additional supervision. We present results
on a variety of natural images and conduct a perceptual study to evaluate and
validate the changes in viewers' eye-gaze between the original images and our
edited results.]]></summary>

consisting of a Mask-RCNN detector, followed by a classification ensemble
consisting of ResNet50 and DenseNet201 to refine detected mitotic candidates.
The MIDOG training data consists of 200 frames originating from four scanners,
three of which are annotated for mitotic instances with centroid annotations.
Our main algorithmic choices are as follows: first, to enhance the
generalizability of our detector and classification networks, we use a
state-of-the-art residual Cycle-GAN to transform each scanner domain to every
other scanner domain. During training, we then randomly load, for each image,
one of the four domains. In this way, our networks can learn from the fourth
non-annotated scanner domain even if we don't have annotations for it. Second,
for training the detector network, rather than using centroid-based fixed-size
bounding boxes, we create mitosis-specific bounding boxes. We do this by
manually annotating a small selection of mitoses, training a Mask-RCNN on this
small dataset, and applying it to the rest of the data to obtain full
annotations. We trained the follow-up classification ensemble using only the
challenge-provided positive and hard-negative examples. On the preliminary test
set, the algorithm scores an F1 score of 0.7578, putting us as the second-place
team on the leaderboard.]]></summary>

correlation clustering) problem, a classical graph clustering problem widely
used in machine learning and computer vision. Our algorithm consists of three
steps executed recursively: (1) Finding conflicted cycles that correspond to
violated inequalities of the underlying multicut relaxation, (2) Performing
message passing between the edges and cycles to optimize the Lagrange
relaxation coming from the found violated cycles producing reduced costs and
(3) Contracting edges with high reduced costs through matrix-matrix
multiplications.

Our algorithm produces primal solutions and dual lower bounds that estimate
the distance to optimum. We implement our algorithm on GPUs and show resulting
one to two order-of-magnitudes improvements in execution speed without
sacrificing solution quality compared to traditional serial algorithms that run
on CPUs. We can solve very large scale benchmark problems with up to
$\mathcal{O}(10^8)$ variables in a few seconds with small primal-dual gaps. We

the guidance of the corresponding auxiliary contrast, which provides additional
anatomical information, is a new and effective solution for fast MR imaging.
However, current multi-contrast super-resolution (SR) methods tend to
concatenate different contrasts directly, ignoring their relationships in
different clues, \eg, in the foreground and background. In this paper, we
propose a separable attention network (comprising a foreground priority
attention and background separation attention), named SANet. Our method can
explore the foreground and background areas in the forward and reverse
directions with the help of the auxiliary contrast, enabling it to learn
clearer anatomical structures and edge information for the SR of a
target-contrast MR image. SANet provides three appealing benefits: (1) It is
the first model to explore a separable attention mechanism that uses the
auxiliary contrast to predict the foreground and background regions, diverting
more attention to refining any uncertain details between these regions and
correcting the fine areas in the reconstructed results. (2) A multi-stage
integration module is proposed to learn the response of multi-contrast fusion
at different stages, obtain the dependency between the fused features, and
improve their representation ability. (3) Extensive experiments with various
state-of-the-art multi-contrast SR methods on fastMRI and clinical \textit{in

improvement for a multitude of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
However, their hefty computational and memory demands make them challenging to
deploy to resource-constrained edge platforms with strict latency requirements.
We present EdgeBERT, an in-depth algorithm-hardware co-design for latency-aware
energy optimization for multi-task NLP. EdgeBERT employs entropy-based early
exit predication in order to perform dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS),
at a sentence granularity, for minimal energy consumption while adhering to a
prescribed target latency. Computation and memory footprint overheads are
further alleviated by employing a calibrated combination of adaptive attention
span, selective network pruning, and floating-point quantization. Furthermore,
in order to maximize the synergistic benefits of these algorithms in always-on
and intermediate edge computing settings, we specialize a 12nm scalable
hardware accelerator system, integrating a fast-switching low-dropout voltage
regulator (LDO), an all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL), as well as,
high-density embedded non-volatile memories (eNVMs) wherein the sparse
floating-point bit encodings of the shared multi-task parameters are carefully
stored. Altogether, latency-aware multi-task NLP inference acceleration on the
EdgeBERT hardware system generates up to 7x, 2.5x, and 53x lower energy
compared to the conventional inference without early stopping, the
latency-unbounded early exit approach, and CUDA adaptations on an Nvidia Jetson
Tegra X2 mobile GPU, respectively.]]></summary>

investigate the impact of partial and complete fine-tuning and analyze the

Experiments on two datasets show that PICO span detection results achieve much

sentence detection at least as good as human annotations. By removing the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In joint entity and relation extraction, existing work either sequentially
encode task-specific features, leading to an imbalance in inter-task feature
interaction where features extracted later have no direct contact with those
that come first. Or they encode entity features and relation features in a
parallel manner, meaning that feature representation learning for each task is
largely independent of each other except for input sharing. We propose a
partition filter network to model two-way interaction between tasks properly,
where feature encoding is decomposed into two steps: partition and filter. In
our encoder, we leverage two gates: entity and relation gate, to segment
neurons into two task partitions and one shared partition. The shared partition
represents inter-task information valuable to both tasks and is evenly shared
across two tasks to ensure proper two-way interaction. The task partitions
represent intra-task information and are formed through concerted efforts of
both gates, making sure that encoding of task-specific features is dependent
upon each other. Experiment results on six public datasets show that our model
performs significantly better than previous approaches. In addition, contrary
to what previous work claims, our auxiliary experiments suggest that relation
prediction is contributory to named entity prediction in a non-negligible way.

tasks, by simply reading textual instructions that define them and looking at a
few examples. NLP models built with the conventional paradigm, however, often
struggle with generalization across tasks (e.g., a question-answering system
cannot solve classification tasks). A long-standing challenge in AI is to build
a model that is equipped with the understanding of human-readable instructions
that define the tasks, and can generalize to new tasks. To study this, we
introduce NATURAL INSTRUCTIONS, a dataset of 61 distinct tasks, their
human-authored instructions and 193k task instances. The instructions are
obtained from crowdsourcing instructions used to collect existing NLP datasets
and mapped to a unified schema. We adopt generative pre-trained language models
to encode task-specific instructions along with input and generate task output.
Our results indicate that models can benefit from instructions to generalize
across tasks. These models, however, are far behind supervised task-specific
models, indicating significant room for more progress in this direction.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past few years, various word-level textual attack approaches have
been proposed to reveal the vulnerability of deep neural networks used in
natural language processing. Typically, these approaches involve an important
optimization step to determine which substitute to be used for each word in the
original input. However, current research on this step is still rather limited,
from the perspectives of both problem-understanding and problem-solving. In
this paper, we address these issues by uncovering the theoretical properties of
the problem and proposing an efficient local search algorithm (LS) to solve it.
We establish the first provable approximation guarantee on solving the problem
in general cases. Notably, for adversarial textual attack, it is even better
than the previous bound which only holds in special case. Extensive experiments
involving five NLP tasks, six datasets and eleven NLP models show that LS can
largely reduce the number of queries usually by an order of magnitude to
achieve high attack success rates. Further experiments show that the
adversarial examples crafted by LS usually have higher quality, exhibit better
transferability, and can bring more robustness improvement to victim models by
adversarial training.]]></summary>

model-based design methodologies for dynamical systems with data-driven
approaches to achieve this target. We confine our attention to NNs with
Rectifier Linear Unit (ReLU) nonlinearity which are known to represent
Continuous Piece-Wise Affine (CPWA) functions. Given a mathematical model of
the dynamical system, we compute a finite-state abstract model that captures
the closed-loop behavior under all possible CPWA controllers. Using this
finite-state abstract model, our framework identifies a family of CPWA
functions guaranteed to satisfy the safety requirements. We augment the
learning algorithm with a NN weight projection operator during training that
enforces the resulting NN to represent a CPWA function from the provably safe
family of CPWA functions. Moreover, the proposed framework uses the
finite-state abstract model to identify candidate CPWA functions that may
satisfy the liveness properties. Using such candidate CPWA functions, the
proposed framework biases the NN training to achieve the liveness

output distributions that concentrate probability mass on tokens likely to

This is achieved by constructing an appropriate dataset for fine-tuning, with

equalization, and background synthesis to the source target-object images. Via
experiments in an indoor experimental workplace for waste-sorting, we confirm
that the proposed methods enable quick collection of the training image sets

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper explores the potential for performing temporal semantic
segmentation in the context of agricultural robotics without temporally
labelled data. We achieve this by proposing to generate virtual temporal
samples from labelled still images. By exploiting the relatively static scene
and assuming that the robot (camera) moves we are able to generate virtually
labelled temporal sequences with no extra annotation effort. Normally, to train
a recurrent neural network (RNN), labelled samples from a video (temporal)
sequence are required which is laborious and has stymied work in this
direction. By generating virtual temporal samples, we demonstrate that it is
possible to train a lightweight RNN to perform semantic segmentation on two
challenging agricultural datasets. Our results show that by training a temporal
semantic segmenter using virtual samples we can increase the performance by an
absolute amount of $4.6$ and $4.9$ on sweet pepper and sugar beet datasets,
respectively. This indicates that our virtual data augmentation technique is
able to accurately classify agricultural images temporally without the use of
complicated synthetic data generation techniques nor with the overhead of
labelling large amounts of temporal sequences.]]></summary>

promote peaceful, non-polarized discourse. However, there is a lack of
large-scale longitudinal studies of its effectiveness for reducing hate speech.
To this end, we perform an exploratory analysis of the effectiveness of counter
speech using several different macro- and micro-level measures to analyze
180,000 political conversations that took place on German Twitter over four
years. We report on the dynamic interactions of hate and counter speech over
time and provide insights into whether, as in `classic' bullying situations,
organized efforts are more effective than independent individuals in steering
online discourse. Taken together, our results build a multifaceted picture of
the dynamics of hate and counter speech online. While we make no causal claims
due to the complexity of discourse dynamics, our findings suggest that
organized hate speech is associated with changes in public discourse and that
counter speech -- especially when organized -- may help curb hateful rhetoric
in online discourse.]]></summary>

concepts such as objects and actions, understanding semantics and language
grounding, and reasoning about the interplay between the two modalities. One
crucial aspect of visual reasoning is spatial understanding, which involves
understanding relative locations of objects, i.e.\ implicitly learning the
geometry of the scene. In this work, we evaluate the faithfulness of V\&L
models to such geometric understanding, by formulating the prediction of
pair-wise relative locations of objects as a classification as well as a
regression task. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art transformer-based
V\&L models lack sufficient abilities to excel at this task. Motivated by this,
we design two objectives as proxies for 3D spatial reasoning (SR) -- object
centroid estimation, and relative position estimation, and train V\&L with weak
supervision from off-the-shelf depth estimators. This leads to considerable
improvements in accuracy for the "GQA" visual question answering challenge (in
fully supervised, few-shot, and O.O.D settings) as well as improvements in
relative spatial reasoning. Code and data will be released

this paper, we present a novel neural scene rendering system, which learns an

design a novel two-pathway architecture, in which the scene branch encodes the

object conditioned on learnable object activation codes. To survive the
training in heavily cluttered scenes, we propose a scene-guided training
strategy to solve the 3D space ambiguity in the occluded regions and learn
sharp boundaries for each object. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
system not only achieves competitive performance for static scene novel-view

explanation that deduces not only the important features of an input space but
also how those features should be modified to classify input as a target class
has gained an increasing interest. The patterns that deep networks have learned
from a training dataset can be grasped by observing the feature variation among
various classes. However, current approaches perform the feature modification
to increase the classification probability for the target class irrespective of
the internal characteristics of deep networks. This often leads to unclear
explanations that deviate from real-world data distributions. To address this
problem, we propose a counterfactual explanation method that exploits the
statistics learned from a training dataset. Especially, we gradually construct
an explanation by iterating over masking and composition steps. The masking
step aims to select an important feature from the input data to be classified
as a target class. Meanwhile, the composition step aims to optimize the
previously selected feature by ensuring that its output score is close to the
logit space of the training data that are classified as the target class.
Experimental results show that our method produces human-friendly
interpretations on various classification datasets and verify that such
interpretations can be achieved with fewer feature modification.]]></summary>

express the objects, attributes, and relationships between objects in the
scene. As computer vision technology continues to develop, people are no longer
satisfied with simply detecting and recognizing objects in images; instead,
people look forward to a higher level of understanding and reasoning about
visual scenes. For example, given an image, we want to not only detect and
recognize objects in the image, but also know the relationship between objects
(visual relationship detection), and generate a text description (image
captioning) based on the image content. Alternatively, we might want the
machine to tell us what the little girl in the image is doing (Visual Question
Answering (VQA)), or even remove the dog from the image and find similar images
(image editing and retrieval), etc. These tasks require a higher level of
understanding and reasoning for image vision tasks. The scene graph is just
such a powerful tool for scene understanding. Therefore, scene graphs have
attracted the attention of a large number of researchers, and related research
is often cross-modal, complex, and rapidly developing. However, no relatively
systematic survey of scene graphs exists at present. To this end, this survey
conducts a comprehensive investigation of the current scene graph research.
More specifically, we first summarized the general definition of the scene
graph, then conducted a comprehensive and systematic discussion on the
generation method of the scene graph (SGG) and the SGG with the aid of prior
knowledge. We then investigated the main applications of scene graphs and
summarized the most commonly used datasets. Finally, we provide some insights
into the future development of scene graphs. We believe this will be a very
helpful foundation for future research on scene graphs.]]></summary>

Near-perfect supervised methods have been developed for use in resource-rich

The most recent approaches rely on neural models trained on recorded dialogs
between humans, implementing an end-to-end learning process. These systems are
commonly designed to generate responses given the user's utterances in natural
language. One main challenge is that these generated responses both have to be
appropriate for the given dialog context and must be grammatically and
semantically correct. An alternative to such generation-based approaches is to
retrieve responses from pre-recorded dialog data and to adapt them if needed.
Such retrieval-based approaches were successfully explored in the context of
general conversational systems, but have received limited attention in recent
years for CRS. In this work, we re-assess the potential of such approaches and
design and evaluate a novel technique for response retrieval and ranking. A
user study (N=90) revealed that the responses by our system were on average of
higher quality than those of two recent generation-based systems. We
furthermore found that the quality ranking of the two generation-based
approaches is not aligned with the results from the literature, which points to
open methodological questions. Overall, our research underlines that
retrieval-based approaches should be considered an alternative or complement to

of the serious health effects of COVID-19 and because of public health measures
implemented to slow its spread. Many of these difficulties are fundamentally
information needs; attempts to address these needs have caused an information
overload for both researchers and the public. Natural language processing
(NLP), the branch of artificial intelligence that interprets human language,
can be applied to address many of the information needs made urgent by the
COVID-19 pandemic. This review surveys approximately 150 NLP studies and more
than 50 systems and datasets addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We detail work
on four core NLP tasks: information retrieval, named entity recognition,
literature-based discovery, and question answering. We also describe work that
directly addresses aspects of the pandemic through four additional tasks: topic
modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, caseload forecasting, and
misinformation detection. We conclude by discussing observable trends and
remaining challenges.]]></summary>

techniques can produce more robust models. However, most existing techniques
focus on augmenting in-domain data in low-resource scenarios where annotated
data is quite limited. In contrast, we study cross-domain data augmentation for
the NER task. We investigate the possibility of leveraging data from
high-resource domains by projecting it into the low-resource domains.
Specifically, we propose a novel neural architecture to transform the data
representation from a high-resource to a low-resource domain by learning the
patterns (e.g. style, noise, abbreviations, etc.) in the text that
differentiate them and a shared feature space where both domains are aligned.
We experiment with diverse datasets and show that transforming the data to the
low-resource domain representation achieves significant improvements over only
using data from high-resource domains.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Masked language modeling (MLM), a self-supervised pretraining objective, is
widely used in natural language processing for learning text representations.
MLM trains a model to predict a random sample of input tokens that have been
replaced by a [MASK] placeholder in a multi-class setting over the entire
vocabulary. When pretraining, it is common to use alongside MLM other auxiliary
objectives on the token or sequence level to improve downstream performance
(e.g. next sentence prediction). However, no previous work so far has attempted
in examining whether other simpler linguistically intuitive or not objectives
can be used standalone as main pretraining objectives. In this paper, we
explore five simple pretraining objectives based on token-level classification
tasks as replacements of MLM. Empirical results on GLUE and SQuAD show that our
proposed methods achieve comparable or better performance to MLM using a
BERT-BASE architecture. We further validate our methods using smaller models,
showing that pretraining a model with 41% of the BERT-BASE's parameters,
BERT-MEDIUM results in only a 1% drop in GLUE scores with our best objective.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vision-and-language (V\&L) reasoning necessitates perception of visual
concepts such as objects and actions, understanding semantics and language
grounding, and reasoning about the interplay between the two modalities. One
crucial aspect of visual reasoning is spatial understanding, which involves
understanding relative locations of objects, i.e.\ implicitly learning the
geometry of the scene. In this work, we evaluate the faithfulness of V\&L
models to such geometric understanding, by formulating the prediction of
pair-wise relative locations of objects as a classification as well as a
regression task. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art transformer-based
V\&L models lack sufficient abilities to excel at this task. Motivated by this,
we design two objectives as proxies for 3D spatial reasoning (SR) -- object
centroid estimation, and relative position estimation, and train V\&L with weak
supervision from off-the-shelf depth estimators. This leads to considerable
improvements in accuracy for the "GQA" visual question answering challenge (in
fully supervised, few-shot, and O.O.D settings) as well as improvements in
relative spatial reasoning. Code and data will be released

emotions behind them. To facilitate the MOD research, we construct a
large-scale open-domain multimodal dialogue dataset incorporating abundant
Internet memes into utterances. The dataset consists of $\sim$45K Chinese
conversations with $\sim$606K utterances. Each conversation contains about $13$
utterances with about $4$ Internet memes on average and each utterance equipped
with an Internet meme is annotated with the corresponding emotion. In addition,
we present a simple and effective method, which utilizes a unified generation
network to solve the MOD task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
trained on the proposed corpus is able to achieve expressive communication
including texts and memes. The corpus and models have been publicly available
at https://github.com/lizekang/DSTC10-MOD.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Masked language modeling (MLM) is one of the key sub-tasks in vision-language
pretraining. In the cross-modal setting, tokens in the sentence are masked at
random, and the model predicts the masked tokens given the image and the text.
In this paper, we observe several key disadvantages of MLM in this setting.
First, as captions tend to be short, in a third of the sentences no token is
sampled. Second, the majority of masked tokens are stop-words and punctuation,
leading to under-utilization of the image. We investigate a range of
alternative masking strategies specific to the cross-modal setting that address
these shortcomings, aiming for better fusion of text and image in the learned
representation. When pre-training the LXMERT model, our alternative masking
strategies consistently improve over the original masking strategy on three
downstream tasks, especially in low resource settings. Further, our
pre-training approach substantially outperforms the baseline model on a
prompt-based probing task designed to elicit image objects. These results and
our analysis indicate that our method allows for better utilization of the
training data.]]></summary>

computational solutions that are both effective and efficient. A common
approach is to represent data objects as binary vectors, denoted \textit{hash
codes}, which require little storage and enable efficient similarity search
through direct indexing into a hash table or through similarity computations in
an appropriate space. Due to the limited expressibility of hash codes, compared
to real-valued representations, a core open challenge is how to generate hash
codes that well capture semantic content or latent properties using a small
number of bits, while ensuring that the hash codes are distributed in a way
that does not reduce their search efficiency. State of the art methods use
representation learning for generating such hash codes, focusing on neural
autoencoder architectures where semantics are encoded into the hash codes by
learning to reconstruct the original inputs of the hash codes. This thesis
addresses the above challenge and makes a number of contributions to
representation learning that (i) improve effectiveness of hash codes through
more expressive representations and a more effective similarity measure than
the current state of the art, namely the Hamming distance, and (ii) improve
efficiency of hash codes by learning representations that are especially suited
to the choice of search method. The contributions are empirically validated on
several tasks related to similarity search and recommendation.]]></summary>

on randomly sampled targets, yet the same systems are later used to predict
user behavior sequentially from a fixed point in time. Simulating online
recommender system performance is notoriously difficult and the discrepancy
between online and offline behaviors is typically not accounted for in offline
evaluations. This disparity permits weaknesses to go unnoticed until the model
is deployed in a production setting. In this paper, we first demonstrate how
omitting temporal context when evaluating recommender system performance leads
to false confidence. To overcome this, we postulate that offline evaluation
protocols can only model real-life use-cases if they account for temporal
context. Next, we propose a training procedure to further embed the temporal
context in existing models. We use a multi-objective approach to introduce
temporal context into traditionally time-unaware recommender systems and
confirm its advantage via the proposed evaluation protocol. Finally, we
validate that the Pareto Fronts obtained with the added objective dominate
those produced by state-of-the-art models that are only optimized for accuracy
on three real-world publicly available datasets. The results show that
including our temporal objective can improve recall@20 by up to 20%.]]></summary>

employ recommender systems in their online businesses, e.g., personalized
purchase prediction of shopping baskets. While most previous techniques have

Embedding (GLOIE) that learns to utilize the temporal properties of sets across
whole users as well as within a user by coining the names as global and local
information to distinguish the two temporal patterns. GLOIE uses Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) and dynamic graph-based model to capture global and local
information and then applies attention to integrate resulting item embeddings.
Additionally, we propose to use Tweedie output for the decoder of VAE as it can
easily model zero-inflated and long-tailed distribution, which is more suitable
for several real-world data distributions than Gaussian or multinomial
counterparts. When evaluated on three public benchmarks, our algorithm
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in most ranking

identify named entities from user queries as diverse surface form attribute
values and afterward transform them into formally canonical forms. Such a
problem consists of two phases: {named entity recognition (NER)} and {attribute
value normalization (AVN)}. However, existing works only focus on the NER phase
but neglect equally important AVN. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a
unified query attribute value extraction system in e-commerce search named
QUEACO, which involves both two phases. Moreover, by leveraging large-scale
weakly-labeled behavior data, we further improve the extraction performance
with less supervision cost. Specifically, for the NER phase, QUEACO adopts a
novel teacher-student network, where a teacher network that is trained on the
strongly-labeled data generates pseudo-labels to refine the weakly-labeled data
for training a student network. Meanwhile, the teacher network can be
dynamically adapted by the feedback of the student's performance on
strongly-labeled data to maximally denoise the noisy supervisions from the weak
labels. For the AVN phase, we also leverage the weakly-labeled
query-to-attribute behavior data to normalize surface form attribute values
from queries into canonical forms from products. Extensive experiments on a
real-world large-scale E-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
QUEACO.]]></summary>

Recent studies propose supervised PQ, where the embedding and quantization
models can be jointly trained with supervised learning. However, there is a
lack of appropriate formulation of the joint training objective; thus, the
improvements over previous non-supervised baselines are limited in reality. In
this work, we propose the Matching-oriented Product Quantization (MoPQ), where
a novel objective Multinoulli Contrastive Loss (MCL) is formulated. With the
minimization of MCL, we are able to maximize the matching probability of query
and ground-truth key, which contributes to the optimal retrieval accuracy.
Given that the exact computation of MCL is intractable due to the demand of
vast contrastive samples, we further propose the Differentiable Cross-device
Sampling (DCS), which significantly augments the contrastive samples for
precise approximation of MCL. We conduct extensive experimental studies on four
real-world datasets, whose results verify the effectiveness of MoPQ.]]></summary>

broader lens on fairness reveals that AI can serve a greater aspiration:
rooting out societal inequities from their source. Specifically, we focus on
inequities in health information, and aim to reduce bias in that domain using
AI. The AI algorithms under the hood of search engines and social media, many
of which are based on recommender systems, have an outsized impact on the
quality of medical and health information online. Therefore, embedding bias
detection and reduction into these recommender systems serving up medical and
health content online could have an outsized positive impact on patient
outcomes and wellbeing.

In this position paper, we offer the following contributions: (1) we propose
a novel framework of Fairness via AI, inspired by insights from medical
education, sociology and antiracism; (2) we define a new term, bisinformation,
which is related to, but distinct from, misinformation, and encourage
researchers to study it; (3) we propose using AI to study, detect and mitigate
biased, harmful, and/or false health information that disproportionately hurts
minority groups in society; and (4) we suggest several pillars and pose several
open problems in order to seed inquiry in this new space. While part (3) of
this work specifically focuses on the health domain, the fundamental computer

datasets together in a common site for developing a powerful QA model. On the
other hand, real-world QA datasets are typically distributed in the form of
isolated islands belonging to different parties. Due to the increasing
awareness of privacy security, it is almost impossible to integrate the data
scattered around, or the cost is prohibited. A possible solution to this
dilemma is a new approach known as federated learning, which is a
privacy-preserving machine learning technique over distributed datasets. In
this work, we propose to adopt federated learning for QA with the special
concern on the statistical heterogeneity of the QA data. Here the heterogeneity
refers to the fact that annotated QA data are typically with non-identical and
independent distribution (non-IID) and unbalanced sizes in practice.
Traditional federated learning methods may sacrifice the accuracy of individual
models under the heterogeneous situation. To tackle this problem, we propose a
novel Federated Matching framework for QA, named FedMatch, with a
backbone-patch architecture. The shared backbone is to distill the common
knowledge of all the participants while the private patch is a compact and
efficient module to retain the domain information for each participant. To
facilitate the evaluation, we build a benchmark collection based on several QA
datasets from different domains to simulate the heterogeneous situation in
practice. Empirical studies demonstrate that our model can achieve significant
improvements against the baselines over all the datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How data is represented and operationalized is critical for building
computational solutions that are both effective and efficient. A common
approach is to represent data objects as binary vectors, denoted \textit{hash
codes}, which require little storage and enable efficient similarity search
through direct indexing into a hash table or through similarity computations in
an appropriate space. Due to the limited expressibility of hash codes, compared
to real-valued representations, a core open challenge is how to generate hash
codes that well capture semantic content or latent properties using a small
number of bits, while ensuring that the hash codes are distributed in a way
that does not reduce their search efficiency. State of the art methods use
representation learning for generating such hash codes, focusing on neural
autoencoder architectures where semantics are encoded into the hash codes by
learning to reconstruct the original inputs of the hash codes. This thesis
addresses the above challenge and makes a number of contributions to
representation learning that (i) improve effectiveness of hash codes through
more expressive representations and a more effective similarity measure than
the current state of the art, namely the Hamming distance, and (ii) improve
efficiency of hash codes by learning representations that are especially suited
to the choice of search method. The contributions are empirically validated on
several tasks related to similarity search and recommendation.]]></summary>

systems (RSs), incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs) to supplement auxiliary
information has attracted considerable attention recently. However, simply
integrating KGs in current KG-based RS models is not necessarily a guarantee to
improve the recommendation performance, which may even weaken the holistic
model capability. This is because the construction of these KGs is independent
of the collection of historical user-item interactions; hence, information in
these KGs may not always be helpful for recommendation to all users.

In this paper, we propose attentive Knowledge-aware Graph convolutional
networks with Collaborative Guidance for personalized Recommendation (CG-KGR).
CG-KGR is a novel knowledge-aware recommendation model that enables ample and
coherent learning of KGs and user-item interactions, via our proposed
Collaborative Guidance Mechanism. Specifically, CG-KGR first encapsulates
historical interactions to interactive information summarization. Then CG-KGR
utilizes it as guidance to extract information out of KGs, which eventually
provides more precise personalized recommendation. We conduct extensive
experiments on four real-world datasets over two recommendation tasks, i.e.,
Top-K recommendation and Click-Through rate (CTR) prediction. The experimental
results show that the CG-KGR model significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art models by 4.0-53.2% and 0.4-3.2%, in terms of Recall metric on
Top-K recommendation and AUC on CTR prediction, respectively.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Active learning has emerged as a standard paradigm in areas with scarcity of
labeled training data, such as in the medical domain. Language models have
emerged as the prevalent choice of several natural language tasks due to the
performance boost offered by these models. However, in several domains, such as
medicine, the scarcity of labeled training data is a common issue. Also, these
models may not work well in cases where class imbalance is prevalent. Active
learning may prove helpful in these cases to boost the performance with a
limited label budget. To this end, we propose a novel method using sampling
techniques based on submodular optimization and optimal transport for active
learning in language models, dubbed ALLWAS. We construct a sampling strategy
based on submodular optimization of the designed objective in the gradient
domain. Furthermore, to enable learning from few samples, we propose a novel
strategy for sampling from the Wasserstein barycenters. Our empirical
evaluations on standard benchmark datasets for text classification show that
our methods perform significantly better (>20% relative increase in some cases)
than existing approaches for active learning on language models.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this article, we propose a systematic approach for fire station location
planning. We develop a machine learning model, based on Random Forest, for
demand prediction and utilize the model further to define a generalized index
to measure quality of fire service in urban settings. Our model is built upon
spatial data collected from multiple different sources. Efficacy of proper
facility planning depends on choice of candidates where fire stations can be
located along with existing stations, if any. Also, the travel time from these
candidates to demand locations need to be taken care of to maintain fire safety
standard. Here, we propose a travel time based clustering technique to identify
suitable candidates. Finally, we develop an optimization problem to select best
locations to install new fire stations. Our optimization problem is built upon
maximum coverage problem, based on integer programming. We present a detailed
experimental study of our proposed approach in collaboration with city of
Victoria Fire Department, MN, USA. Our demand prediction model achieves true
positive rate of 70% and false positive rate of 22% approximately. We aid
Victoria Fire Department to select a location for a new fire station using our
approach. We present detailed results on improvement statistics by locating a
new facility, as suggested by our methodology, in the city of Victoria.]]></summary>
