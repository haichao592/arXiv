                    <span>In this work, we describe a full-stack pipeline for natural language
processing on near-term quantum computers, aka QNLP. The language-modelling
framework we employ is that of compositional distributional semantics
(DisCoCat), which extends and complements the compositional structure of
pregroup grammars. Within this model, the grammatical reduction of a sentence
is interpreted as a diagram, encoding a specific interaction of words according
to the grammar. It is this interaction which, together with a specific choice
of word embedding, realises the meaning (or &quot;semantics&quot;) of a sentence.
Building on the formal quantum-like nature of such interactions, we present a
method for mapping DisCoCat diagrams to quantum circuits. Our methodology is
compatible both with NISQ devices and with established Quantum Machine Learning
techniques, paving the way to near-term applications of quantum technology to
natural language processing.</span>

                    <span>Relation Extraction (RE) from tables is the task of identifying relations
between pairs of columns of a table. Generally, RE models for this task require
labelled tables for training. These labelled tables can also be generated
artificially from a Knowledge Graph (KG), which makes the cost to acquire them
much lower in comparison to manual annotations. However, unlike real tables,
these synthetic tables lack associated metadata, such as, column-headers,
captions, etc; this is because synthetic tables are created out of KGs that do
not store such metadata. Meanwhile, previous works have shown that metadata is
important for accurate RE from tables. To address this issue, we propose
methods to artificially create some of this metadata for synthetic tables.
Afterward, we experiment with a BERT-based model, in line with recently
published works, that takes as input a combination of proposed artificial
metadata and table content. Our empirical results show that this leads to an
improvement of 9\%-45\% in F1 score, in absolute terms, over 2 tabular
datasets.</span>

                    <span>Existing technologies expand BERT from different perspectives, e.g. designing
different pre-training tasks, different semantic granularities and different
model architectures. Few models consider expanding BERT from different text
formats. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous knowledge language model
(HKLM), a unified pre-trained language model (PLM) for all forms of text,
including unstructured text, semi-structured text and well-structured text. To
capture the corresponding relations among these multi-format knowledge, our
approach uses masked language model objective to learn word knowledge, uses
triple classification objective and title matching objective to learn entity
knowledge and topic knowledge respectively. To obtain the aforementioned
multi-format text, we construct a corpus in the tourism domain and conduct
experiments on 5 tourism NLP datasets. The results show that our approach
outperforms the pre-training of plain text using only 1/4 of the data. The
code, datasets, corpus and knowledge graph will be released.</span>

                    <span>Coherence is an important aspect of text quality and is crucial for ensuring
its readability. It is essential desirable for outputs from text generation
systems like summarization, question answering, machine translation, question
generation, table-to-text, etc. An automated coherence scoring model is also
helpful in essay scoring or providing writing feedback. A large body of
previous work has leveraged entity-based methods, syntactic patterns, discourse
relations, and more recently traditional deep learning architectures for text
coherence assessment. Previous work suffers from drawbacks like the inability
to handle long-range dependencies, out-of-vocabulary words, or model sequence
information. We hypothesize that coherence assessment is a cognitively complex
task that requires deeper models and can benefit from other related tasks.
Accordingly, in this paper, we propose four different Transformer-based
architectures for the task: vanilla Transformer, hierarchical Transformer,
multi-task learning-based model, and a model with fact-based input
representation. Our experiments with popular benchmark datasets across multiple
domains on four different coherence assessment tasks demonstrate that our
models achieve state-of-the-art results outperforming existing models by a good
margin.</span>

                    <span>The task of learning from only a few examples (called a few-shot setting) is
of key importance and relevance to a real-world setting. For question answering
(QA), the current state-of-the-art pre-trained models typically need
fine-tuning on tens of thousands of examples to obtain good results. Their
performance degrades significantly in a few-shot setting (&lt; 100 examples). To
address this, we propose a simple fine-tuning framework that leverages
pre-trained text-to-text models and is directly aligned with their pre-training
framework. Specifically, we construct the input as a concatenation of the
question, a mask token representing the answer span and a context. Given this
input, the model is fine-tuned using the same objective as that of its
pre-training objective. Through experimental studies on various few-shot
configurations, we show that this formulation leads to significant gains on
multiple QA benchmarks (an absolute gain of 34.2 F1 points on average when
there are only 16 training examples). The gains extend further when used with
larger models (Eg:- 72.3 F1 on SQuAD using BART-large with only 32 examples)
and translate well to a multilingual setting . On the multilingual TydiQA
benchmark, our model outperforms the XLM-Roberta-large by an absolute margin of
upto 40 F1 points and an average of 33 F1 points in a few-shot setting (&lt;&#x3D; 64
training examples). We conduct detailed ablation studies to analyze factors
contributing to these gains.</span>

                    <span>The primary paradigm for multi-task training in natural language processing
is to represent the input with a shared pre-trained language model, and add a
small, thin network (head) per task. Given an input, a target head is the head
that is selected for outputting the final prediction. In this work, we examine
the behaviour of non-target heads, that is, the output of heads when given
input that belongs to a different task than the one they were trained for. We
find that non-target heads exhibit emergent behaviour, which may either explain
the target task, or generalize beyond their original task. For example, in a
numerical reasoning task, a span extraction head extracts from the input the
arguments to a computation that results in a number generated by a target
generative head. In addition, a summarization head that is trained with a
target question answering head, outputs query-based summaries when given a
question and a context from which the answer is to be extracted. This emergent
behaviour suggests that multi-task training leads to non-trivial extrapolation
of skills, which can be harnessed for interpretability and generalization.</span>

                    <span>As the digital news industry becomes the main channel of information
dissemination, the adverse impact of fake news is explosively magnified. The
credibility of a news report should not be considered in isolation. Rather,
previously published news articles on the similar event could be used to assess
the credibility of a news report. Inspired by this, we propose a BERT-based
multimodal unreliable news detection framework, which captures both textual and
visual information from unreliable articles utilising the contrastive learning
strategy. The contrastive learner interacts with the unreliable news classifier
to push similar credible news (or similar unreliable news) closer while moving
news articles with similar content but opposite credibility labels away from
each other in the multimodal embedding space. Experimental results on a
COVID-19 related dataset, ReCOVery, show that our model outperforms a number of
competitive baseline in unreliable news detection.</span>

                    <span>Transformer is a powerful model for text understanding. However, it is
inefficient due to its quadratic complexity to input sequence length. Although
there are many methods on Transformer acceleration, they are still either
inefficient on long sequences or not effective enough. In this paper, we
propose Fastformer, which is an efficient Transformer model based on additive
attention. In Fastformer, instead of modeling the pair-wise interactions
between tokens, we first use additive attention mechanism to model global
contexts, and then further transform each token representation based on its
interaction with global context representations. In this way, Fastformer can
achieve effective context modeling with linear complexity. Extensive
experiments on five datasets show that Fastformer is much more efficient than
many existing Transformer models and can meanwhile achieve comparable or even
better long text modeling performance.</span>

                    <span>Existing Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models have been shown to
incorporate dataset biases leading to strong performance on in-distribution
(ID) test sets but poor performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) ones. We
introduce a simple yet effective debiasing framework whereby the shallow
representations of the main model are used to derive a bias model and both
models are trained simultaneously. We demonstrate on three well studied NLU
tasks that despite its simplicity, our method leads to competitive OOD results.
It significantly outperforms other debiasing approaches on two tasks, while

                    <span>Considering the importance of building a good Visual Dialog (VD) Questioner,
many researchers study the topic under a Q-Bot-A-Bot image-guessing game
setting, where the Questioner needs to raise a series of questions to collect
information of an undisclosed image. Despite progress has been made in
Supervised Learning (SL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), issues still exist.
Firstly, previous methods do not provide explicit and effective guidance for
Questioner to generate visually related and informative questions. Secondly,
the effect of RL is hampered by an incompetent component, i.e., the Guesser,
who makes image predictions based on the generated dialogs and assigns rewards
accordingly. To enhance VD Questioner: 1) we propose a Related entity enhanced
Questioner (ReeQ) that generates questions under the guidance of related
entities and learns entity-based questioning strategy from human dialogs; 2) we
propose an Augmented Guesser (AugG) that is strong and is optimized for the VD
setting especially. Experimental results on the VisDial v1.0 dataset show that
our approach achieves state-of-theart performance on both image-guessing task
and question diversity. Human study further proves that our model generates
more visually related, informative and coherent questions.</span>

                    <span>Extended versions of the Lambek Calculus currently used in computational
linguistics rely on unary modalities to allow for the controlled application of
structural rules affecting word order and phrase structure. These controlled
structural operations give rise to derivational ambiguities that are missed by
the original Lambek Calculus or its pregroup simplification. Proposals for
compositional interpretation of extended Lambek Calculus in the compact closed
category of FVect and linear maps have been made, but in these proposals the
syntax-semantics mapping ignores the control modalities, effectively
restricting their role to the syntax. Our aim is to turn the modalities into
first-class citizens of the vectorial interpretation. Building on the
directional density matrix semantics, we extend the interpretation of the type
system with an extra spin density matrix space. The interpretation of proofs
then results in ambiguous derivations being tensored with orthogonal spin
states. Our method introduces a way of simultaneously representing co-existing
interpretations of ambiguous utterances, and provides a uniform framework for
the integration of lexical and derivational ambiguity.</span>

                    <span>In recent years, world business in online discussions and opinion sharing on
social media is booming. Re-entry prediction task is thus proposed to help
people keep track of the discussions which they wish to continue. Nevertheless,
existing works only focus on exploiting chatting history and context
information, and ignore the potential useful learning signals underlying
conversation data, such as conversation thread patterns and repeated engagement
of target users, which help better understand the behavior of target users in
conversations. In this paper, we propose three interesting and well-founded
auxiliary tasks, namely, Spread Pattern, Repeated Target user, and Turn
Authorship, as the self-supervised signals for re-entry prediction. These
auxiliary tasks are trained together with the main task in a multi-task manner.
Experimental results on two datasets newly collected from Twitter and Reddit
show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-arts with fewer
parameters and faster convergence. Extensive experiments and analysis show the
effectiveness of our proposed models and also point out some key ideas in

led to significant performance gains on a wide range of cross-lingual NLP
tasks, success on many downstream tasks still relies on the availability of
sufficient annotated data. Traditional fine-tuning of pre-trained models using
only a few target samples can cause over-fitting. This can be quite limiting as
most languages in the world are under-resourced. In this work, we investigate
cross-lingual adaptation using a simple nearest neighbor few-shot (&lt;15 samples)

distinct languages across two NLP tasks- XNLI and PAWS-X. Our approach

                    <span>Learning multilingual and multi-domain translation model is challenging as
the heterogeneous and imbalanced data make the model converge inconsistently
over different corpora in real world. One common practice is to adjust the
share of each corpus in the training, so that the learning process is balanced
and low-resource cases can benefit from the high resource ones. However,
automatic balancing methods usually depend on the intra- and inter-dataset
characteristics, which is usually agnostic or requires human priors. In this
work, we propose an approach, MultiUAT, that dynamically adjusts the training
data usage based on the model&#x27;s uncertainty on a small set of trusted clean
data for multi-corpus machine translation. We experiments with two classes of
uncertainty measures on multilingual (16 languages with 4 settings) and
multi-domain settings (4 for in-domain and 2 for out-of-domain on
English-German translation) and demonstrate our approach MultiUAT substantially
outperforms its baselines, including both static and dynamic strategies. We

                    <span>Dialogue summarization has drawn much attention recently. Especially in the
customer service domain, agents could use dialogue summaries to help boost
their works by quickly knowing customer&#x27;s issues and service progress. These
applications require summaries to contain the perspective of a single speaker
and have a clear topic flow structure, while neither are available in existing
datasets. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel Chinese dataset for
Customer Service Dialogue Summarization (CSDS). CSDS improves the abstractive
summaries in two aspects: (1) In addition to the overall summary for the whole
dialogue, role-oriented summaries are also provided to acquire different
speakers&#x27; viewpoints. (2) All the summaries sum up each topic separately, thus
containing the topic-level structure of the dialogue. We define tasks in CSDS
as generating the overall summary and different role-oriented summaries for a
given dialogue. Next, we compare various summarization methods on CSDS, and
experiment results show that existing methods are prone to generate redundant
and incoherent summaries. Besides, the performance becomes much worse when
analyzing the performance on role-oriented summaries and topic structures. We
hope that this study could benchmark Chinese dialogue summarization and benefit
further studies.</span>

                    <span>Learning hierarchical structures in sequential data -- from simple
algorithmic patterns to natural language -- in a reliable, generalizable way
remains a challenging problem for neural language models. Past work has shown
that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) struggle to generalize on held-out
algorithmic or syntactic patterns without supervision or some inductive bias.
To remedy this, many papers have explored augmenting RNNs with various
differentiable stacks, by analogy with finite automata and pushdown automata.
In this paper, we present a stack RNN model based on the recently proposed
Nondeterministic Stack RNN (NS-RNN) that achieves lower cross-entropy than all
previous stack RNNs on five context-free language modeling tasks (within 0.05
nats of the information-theoretic lower bound), including a task in which the
NS-RNN previously failed to outperform a deterministic stack RNN baseline. Our
model assigns arbitrary positive weights instead of probabilities to stack
actions, and we provide an analysis of why this improves training. We also
propose a restricted version of the NS-RNN that makes it practical to use for
language modeling on natural language and present results on the Penn Treebank
corpus.</span>

                    <span>Identifying emotions from text is crucial for a variety of real world tasks.
We consider the two largest now-available corpora for emotion classification:
GoEmotions, with 58k messages labelled by readers, and Vent, with 33M
writer-labelled messages. We design a benchmark and evaluate several feature
spaces and learning algorithms, including two simple yet novel models on top of
BERT that outperform previous strong baselines on GoEmotions. Through an
experiment with human participants, we also analyze the differences between how
writers express emotions and how readers perceive them. Our results suggest
that emotions expressed by writers are harder to identify than emotions that
readers perceive. We share a public web interface for researchers to explore
our models.</span>

                    <span>Though language model text embeddings have revolutionized NLP research, their
ability to capture high-level semantic information, such as relations between
entities in text, is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive
learning framework that trains sentence embeddings to encode the relations in a
graph structure. Given a sentence (unstructured text) and its graph, we use
contrastive learning to impose relation-related structure on the token-level
representations of the sentence obtained with a CharacterBERT (El Boukkouri et
al.,2020) model. The resulting relation-aware sentence embeddings achieve
state-of-the-art results on the relation extraction task using only a simple
KNN classifier, thereby demonstrating the success of the proposed method.
Additional visualization by a tSNE analysis shows the effectiveness of the
learned representation space compared to baselines. Furthermore, we show that
we can learn a different space for named entity recognition, again using a
contrastive learning objective, and demonstrate how to successfully combine
both representation spaces in an entity-relation task.</span>

                    <span>Transformer-based pre-trained language models boost the performance of
open-domain dialogue systems. Prior works leverage Transformer-based
pre-trained language models to generate texts with desired attributes in two
general approaches: (1) gradient-based methods: updating all latent
representations of pre-trained models with gradients from attribute models; (2)
weighted-decoding methods: re-ranking beam candidates from pre-trained models
with attribute functions. However, gradient-based methods lead to high
computation cost and can easily get overfitted on small training sets, while
weighted-decoding methods are inherently constrained by the low-variance
high-bias pre-trained model. In this work, we propose a novel approach to
control the generation of Transformer-based pre-trained language models: the
SideControl framework, which leverages a novel control attributes loss to
incorporate useful control signals, and is shown to perform well with very
limited training samples. We evaluate our proposed method on two benchmark
open-domain dialogue datasets, and results show that the SideControl framework
has better controllability, higher generation quality and better
sample-efficiency than existing gradient-based and weighted-decoding baselines.</span>

                    <span>Distantly supervised relation extraction (RE) automatically aligns
unstructured text with relation instances in a knowledge base (KB). Due to the
incompleteness of current KBs, sentences implying certain relations may be
annotated as N/A instances, which causes the so-called false negative (FN)
problem. Current RE methods usually overlook this problem, inducing improper
biases in both training and testing procedures. To address this issue, we
propose a two-stage approach. First, it finds out possible FN samples by
heuristically leveraging the memory mechanism of deep neural networks. Then, it
aligns those unlabeled data with the training data into a unified feature space
by adversarial training to assign pseudo labels and further utilize the
information contained in them. Experiments on two wildly-used benchmark
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</span>

                    <span>Product quantization (PQ) is a widely used technique for ad-hoc retrieval.
Recent studies propose supervised PQ, where the embedding and quantization
models can be jointly trained with supervised learning. However, there is a
lack of appropriate formulation of the joint training objective; thus, the
improvements over previous non-supervised baselines are limited in reality. In
this work, we propose the Matching-oriented Product Quantization (MoPQ), where
a novel objective Multinoulli Contrastive Loss (MCL) is formulated. With the
minimization of MCL, we are able to maximize the matching probability of query
and ground-truth key, which contributes to the optimal retrieval accuracy.
Given that the exact computation of MCL is intractable due to the demand of
vast contrastive samples, we further propose the Differentiable Cross-device
Sampling (DCS), which significantly augments the contrastive samples for
precise approximation of MCL. We conduct extensive experimental studies on four
real-world datasets, whose results verify the effectiveness of MoPQ.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we explore the effects of language variants, data sizes, and
fine-tuning task types in Arabic pre-trained language models. To do so, we
build three pre-trained language models across three variants of Arabic: Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), dialectal Arabic, and classical Arabic, in addition to a
fourth language model which is pre-trained on a mix of the three. We also
examine the importance of pre-training data size by building additional models
that are pre-trained on a scaled-down set of the MSA variant. We compare our
different models to each other, as well as to eight publicly available models
by fine-tuning them on five NLP tasks spanning 12 datasets. Our results suggest
that the variant proximity of pre-training data to fine-tuning data is more
important than the pre-training data size. We exploit this insight in defining
an optimized system selection model for the studied tasks.</span>

                    <span>Linguistic entrainment is a phenomenon where people tend to mimic each other
in conversation. The core instrument to quantify entrainment is a linguistic
similarity measure between conversational partners. Most of the current
similarity measures are based on bag-of-words approaches that rely on
linguistic markers, ignoring the overall language structure and dialogue
context. To address this issue, we propose to use a neural network model to
perform the similarity measure for entrainment. Our model is context-aware, and
it further leverages a novel component to learn the shared high-level
linguistic features across dialogues. We first investigate the effectiveness of
our novel component. Then we use the model to perform similarity measure in a
corpus-based entrainment analysis. We observe promising results for both
evaluation tasks.</span>

                    <span>It is presented here a machine learning-based (ML) natural language
processing (NLP) approach capable to automatically recognize and extract
categorical and numerical parameters from a corpus of articles. The approach
(named a.RIX) operates with a concomitant/interchangeable use of ML models such
as neuron networks (NNs), latent semantic analysis (LSA), naive-Bayes
classifiers (NBC), and a pattern recognition model using regular expression
(REGEX). A corpus of 7,873 scientific articles dealing with natural products
(NPs) was used to demonstrate the efficiency of the a.RIX engine. The engine
automatically extracts categorical and numerical parameters such as (i) the
plant species from which active molecules are extracted, (ii) the
microorganisms species for which active molecules can act against, and (iii)
the values of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against these
microorganisms. The parameters are extracted without part-of-speech tagging
(POS) and named entity recognition (NER) approaches (i.e. without the need of
text annotation), and the models training is performed with unsupervised
approaches. In this way, a.RIX can be essentially used on articles from any
scientific field. Finally, it can potentially make obsolete the current article
reviewing process in some areas, especially those in which machine learning
models capture texts structure, text semantics, and latent knowledge.</span>

of utterance emotion dynamics (UED) metrics inspired by work in Psychology. We
use this approach to trace emotional arcs of movie characters. We analyze
thousands of such character arcs to test hypotheses that inform our broader
understanding of stories. Notably, we show that there is a tendency for
characters to use increasingly more negative words and become increasingly
emotionally discordant with each other until about 90 percent of the narrative
length. UED also has applications in behavior studies, social sciences, and

                    <span>Medical dialogue systems (MDSs) aim to assist doctors and patients with a
range of professional medical services, i.e., diagnosis, consultation, and
treatment. However, one-stop MDS is still unexplored because: (1) no dataset
has so large-scale dialogues contains both multiple medical services and
fine-grained medical labels (i.e., intents, slots, values); (2) no model has
addressed a MDS based on multiple-service conversations in a unified framework.
In this work, we first build a Multiple-domain Multiple-service medical
dialogue (M^2-MedDialog)dataset, which contains 1,557 conversations between
doctors and patients, covering 276 types of diseases, 2,468 medical entities,
and 3 specialties of medical services. To the best of our knowledge, it is the
only medical dialogue dataset that includes both multiple medical services and
fine-grained medical labels. Then, we formulate a one-stop MDS as a
sequence-to-sequence generation problem. We unify a MDS with causal language
modeling and conditional causal language modeling, respectively. Specifically,
we employ several pretrained models (i.e., BERT-WWM, BERT-MED, GPT2, and MT5)

pseudo labeling and natural perturbation methods to expand M2-MedDialog dataset
and enhance the state-of-the-art pretrained models. We demonstrate the results
achieved by the benchmarks so far through extensive experiments on
M2-MedDialog. We release the dataset, the code, as well as the evaluation

                    <span>Scenario-based question answering (SQA) requires retrieving and reading
paragraphs from a large corpus to answer a question which is contextualized by
a long scenario description. Since a scenario contains both keyphrases for
retrieval and much noise, retrieval for SQA is extremely difficult. Moreover,
it can hardly be supervised due to the lack of relevance labels of paragraphs
for SQA. To meet the challenge, in this paper we propose a joint
retriever-reader model called JEEVES where the retriever is implicitly
supervised only using QA labels via a novel word weighting mechanism. JEEVES
significantly outperforms a variety of strong baselines on multiple-choice
questions in three SQA datasets.</span>

                    <span>Opinion prediction is an emerging research area with diverse real-world
applications, such as market research and situational awareness. We identify
two lines of approaches to the problem of opinion prediction. One uses
topic-based sentiment analysis with time-series modeling, while the other uses
static embedding of text. The latter approaches seek user-specific solutions by
generating user fingerprints. Such approaches are useful in predicting user&#x27;s
reactions to unseen content. In this work, we propose a novel dynamic
fingerprinting method that leverages contextual embedding of user&#x27;s comments
conditioned on relevant user&#x27;s reading history. We integrate BERT variants with
a recurrent neural network to generate predictions. The results show up to 13\%
improvement in micro F1-score compared to previous approaches. Experimental
results show novel insights that were previously unknown such as better
predictions for an increase in dynamic history length, the impact of the nature
of the article on performance, thereby laying the foundation for further
research.</span>

                    <span>The rise of social media has led to the increasing of comments on online
forums. However, there still exists invalid comments which are not informative
for users. Moreover, those comments are also quite toxic and harmful to people.
In this paper, we create a dataset for constructive and toxic speech detection,
named UIT-ViCTSD (Vietnamese Constructive and Toxic Speech Detection dataset)
with 10,000 human-annotated comments. For these tasks, we propose a system for
constructive and toxic speech detection with the state-of-the-art transfer
learning model in Vietnamese NLP as PhoBERT. With this system, we obtain
F1-scores of 78.59% and 59.40% for classifying constructive and toxic comments,
respectively. Besides, we implement various baseline models as traditional
Machine Learning and Deep Neural Network-Based models to evaluate the dataset.
With the results, we can solve several tasks on the online discussions and
develop the framework for identifying constructiveness and toxicity of
Vietnamese social media comments automatically.</span>

                    <span>We study the problem of query attribute value extraction, which aims to
identify named entities from user queries as diverse surface form attribute
values and afterward transform them into formally canonical forms. Such a
problem consists of two phases: {named entity recognition (NER)} and {attribute
value normalization (AVN)}. However, existing works only focus on the NER phase
but neglect equally important AVN. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a
unified query attribute value extraction system in e-commerce search named
QUEACO, which involves both two phases. Moreover, by leveraging large-scale
weakly-labeled behavior data, we further improve the extraction performance
with less supervision cost. Specifically, for the NER phase, QUEACO adopts a
novel teacher-student network, where a teacher network that is trained on the
strongly-labeled data generates pseudo-labels to refine the weakly-labeled data
for training a student network. Meanwhile, the teacher network can be
dynamically adapted by the feedback of the student&#x27;s performance on
strongly-labeled data to maximally denoise the noisy supervisions from the weak
labels. For the AVN phase, we also leverage the weakly-labeled
query-to-attribute behavior data to normalize surface form attribute values
from queries into canonical forms from products. Extensive experiments on a
real-world large-scale E-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
QUEACO.</span>

                    <span>Biomedical entity linking is the task of linking entity mentions in a
biomedical document to referent entities in a knowledge base. Recently, many
BERT-based models have been introduced for the task. While these models have
achieved competitive results on many datasets, they are computationally
expensive and contain about 110M parameters. Little is known about the factors
contributing to their impressive performance and whether the
over-parameterization is needed. In this work, we shed some light on the inner
working mechanisms of these large BERT-based models. Through a set of probing
experiments, we have found that the entity linking performance only changes
slightly when the input word order is shuffled or when the attention scope is
limited to a fixed window size. From these observations, we propose an
efficient convolutional neural network with residual connections for biomedical
entity linking. Because of the sparse connectivity and weight sharing
properties, our model has a small number of parameters and is highly efficient.
On five public datasets, our model achieves comparable or even better linking
accuracy than the state-of-the-art BERT-based models while having about 60
times fewer parameters.</span>

                    <span>Sentence order prediction is the task of finding the correct order of
sentences in a randomly ordered document. Correctly ordering the sentences
requires an understanding of coherence with respect to the chronological
sequence of events described in the text. Document-level contextual
understanding and commonsense knowledge centered around these events are often
essential in uncovering this coherence and predicting the exact chronological
order. In this paper, we introduce STaCK -- a framework based on graph neural
networks and temporal commonsense knowledge to model global information and
predict the relative order of sentences. Our graph network accumulates temporal
evidence using knowledge of &#x60;past&#x27; and &#x60;future&#x27; and formulates sentence
ordering as a constrained edge classification problem. We report results on
five different datasets, and empirically show that the proposed method is
naturally suitable for order prediction. The implementation of this work is
publicly available at: https://github.com/declare-lab/sentence-ordering.</span>

                    <span>Transformer-based language models such as BERT provide significant accuracy
improvement for a multitude of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
However, their hefty computational and memory demands make them challenging to
deploy to resource-constrained edge platforms with strict latency requirements.
We present EdgeBERT, an in-depth algorithm-hardware co-design for latency-aware
energy optimization for multi-task NLP. EdgeBERT employs entropy-based early
exit predication in order to perform dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS),
at a sentence granularity, for minimal energy consumption while adhering to a
prescribed target latency. Computation and memory footprint overheads are
further alleviated by employing a calibrated combination of adaptive attention
span, selective network pruning, and floating-point quantization. Furthermore,
in order to maximize the synergistic benefits of these algorithms in always-on
and intermediate edge computing settings, we specialize a 12nm scalable
hardware accelerator system, integrating a fast-switching low-dropout voltage
regulator (LDO), an all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL), as well as,
high-density embedded non-volatile memories (eNVMs) wherein the sparse
floating-point bit encodings of the shared multi-task parameters are carefully
stored. Altogether, latency-aware multi-task NLP inference acceleration on the
EdgeBERT hardware system generates up to 7x, 2.5x, and 53x lower energy
compared to the conventional inference without early stopping, the
latency-unbounded early exit approach, and CUDA adaptations on an Nvidia Jetson
Tegra X2 mobile GPU, respectively.</span>

                    <span>Question Paraphrase Identification (QPI) is a critical task for large-scale
Question-Answering forums. The purpose of QPI is to determine whether a given
pair of questions are semantically identical or not. Previous approaches for
this task have yielded promising results, but have often relied on complex
recurrence mechanisms that are expensive and time-consuming in nature. In this
paper, we propose a novel architecture combining a Bidirectional Transformer
Encoder with Convolutional Neural Networks for the QPI task. We produce the
predictions from the proposed architecture using two different inference
setups: Siamese and Matched Aggregation. Experimental results demonstrate that
our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Quora Question Pairs
dataset. We empirically prove that the addition of convolution layers to the
model architecture improves the results in both inference setups. We also
investigate the impact of partial and complete fine-tuning and analyze the
trade-off between computational power and accuracy in the process. Based on the
obtained results, we conclude that the Matched-Aggregation setup consistently
outperforms the Siamese setup. Our work provides insights into what
architecture combinations and setups are likely to produce better results for
the QPI task.</span>

                    <span>The rapid growth in published clinical trials makes it difficult to maintain
up-to-date systematic reviews, which requires finding all relevant trials. This
leads to policy and practice decisions based on out-of-date, incomplete, and
biased subsets of available clinical evidence. Extracting and then normalising
Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) information from
clinical trial articles may be an effective way to automatically assign trials
to systematic reviews and avoid searching and screening - the two most
time-consuming systematic review processes. We propose and test a novel
approach to PICO span detection. The major difference between our proposed
method and previous approaches comes from detecting spans without needing
annotated span data and using only crowdsourced sentence-level annotations.
Experiments on two datasets show that PICO span detection results achieve much
higher results for recall when compared to fully supervised methods with PICO
sentence detection at least as good as human annotations. By removing the
reliance on expert annotations for span detection, this work could be used in
human-machine pipeline for turning low-quality crowdsourced, and sentence-level
PICO annotations into structured information that can be used to quickly assign
trials to relevant systematic reviews.</span>

ground the generation of abstractive summaries. Specifically, we prepend (or
prompt) target summaries with entity chains -- ordered sequences of entities
mentioned in the summary. Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence models are
then trained to generate the entity chain and then continue generating the
summary conditioned on the entity chain and the input. We experimented with
both pretraining and finetuning with this content planning objective. When
evaluated on CNN/DailyMail, XSum, SAMSum and BillSum, we demonstrate
empirically that the grounded generation with the planning objective improves
entity specificity and planning in summaries for all datasets, and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on XSum and SAMSum in terms of Rouge. Moreover, we
demonstrate empirically that planning with entity chains provides a mechanism
to control hallucinations in abstractive summaries. By prompting the decoder
with a modified content plan that drops hallucinated entities, we outperform
state-of-the-art approaches for faithfulness when evaluated automatically and
by humans.</span>

                    <span>In joint entity and relation extraction, existing work either sequentially
encode task-specific features, leading to an imbalance in inter-task feature
interaction where features extracted later have no direct contact with those
that come first. Or they encode entity features and relation features in a
parallel manner, meaning that feature representation learning for each task is
largely independent of each other except for input sharing. We propose a
partition filter network to model two-way interaction between tasks properly,
where feature encoding is decomposed into two steps: partition and filter. In
our encoder, we leverage two gates: entity and relation gate, to segment
neurons into two task partitions and one shared partition. The shared partition
represents inter-task information valuable to both tasks and is evenly shared
across two tasks to ensure proper two-way interaction. The task partitions
represent intra-task information and are formed through concerted efforts of
both gates, making sure that encoding of task-specific features is dependent
upon each other. Experiment results on six public datasets show that our model
performs significantly better than previous approaches. In addition, contrary
to what previous work claims, our auxiliary experiments suggest that relation
prediction is contributory to named entity prediction in a non-negligible way.

                    <span>Humans (e.g., crowdworkers) have a remarkable ability in solving different
tasks, by simply reading textual instructions that define them and looking at a
few examples. NLP models built with the conventional paradigm, however, often
struggle with generalization across tasks (e.g., a question-answering system
cannot solve classification tasks). A long-standing challenge in AI is to build
a model that is equipped with the understanding of human-readable instructions
that define the tasks, and can generalize to new tasks. To study this, we
introduce NATURAL INSTRUCTIONS, a dataset of 61 distinct tasks, their
human-authored instructions and 193k task instances. The instructions are
obtained from crowdsourcing instructions used to collect existing NLP datasets
and mapped to a unified schema. We adopt generative pre-trained language models
to encode task-specific instructions along with input and generate task output.
Our results indicate that models can benefit from instructions to generalize
across tasks. These models, however, are far behind supervised task-specific
models, indicating significant room for more progress in this direction.</span>

                    <span>Over the past few years, various word-level textual attack approaches have
been proposed to reveal the vulnerability of deep neural networks used in
natural language processing. Typically, these approaches involve an important
optimization step to determine which substitute to be used for each word in the
original input. However, current research on this step is still rather limited,
from the perspectives of both problem-understanding and problem-solving. In
this paper, we address these issues by uncovering the theoretical properties of
the problem and proposing an efficient local search algorithm (LS) to solve it.
We establish the first provable approximation guarantee on solving the problem
in general cases. Notably, for adversarial textual attack, it is even better
than the previous bound which only holds in special case. Extensive experiments
involving five NLP tasks, six datasets and eleven NLP models show that LS can
largely reduce the number of queries usually by an order of magnitude to
achieve high attack success rates. Further experiments show that the
adversarial examples crafted by LS usually have higher quality, exhibit better
transferability, and can bring more robustness improvement to victim models by
adversarial training.</span>

                    <span>Numerical reasoning skills are essential for complex question answering (CQA)
over text. It requires opertaions including counting, comparison, addition and
subtraction. A successful approach to CQA on text, Neural Module Networks
(NMNs), follows the programmer-interpreter paradigm and leverages specialised
modules to perform compositional reasoning. However, the NMNs framework does
not consider the relationship between numbers and entities in both questions
and paragraphs. We propose effective techniques to improve NMNs&#x27; numerical
reasoning capabilities by making the interpreter question-aware and capturing
the relationship between entities and numbers. On the same subset of the DROP
dataset for CQA on text, experimental results show that our additions
outperform the original NMNs by 3.0 points for the overall F1 score.</span>

                    <span>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on society, both because
of the serious health effects of COVID-19 and because of public health measures
implemented to slow its spread. Many of these difficulties are fundamentally
information needs; attempts to address these needs have caused an information
overload for both researchers and the public. Natural language processing
(NLP), the branch of artificial intelligence that interprets human language,
can be applied to address many of the information needs made urgent by the
COVID-19 pandemic. This review surveys approximately 150 NLP studies and more
than 50 systems and datasets addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We detail work
on four core NLP tasks: information retrieval, named entity recognition,
literature-based discovery, and question answering. We also describe work that
directly addresses aspects of the pandemic through four additional tasks: topic
modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, caseload forecasting, and
misinformation detection. We conclude by discussing observable trends and
remaining challenges.</span>

                    <span>Feed-forward layers constitute two-thirds of a transformer model&#x27;s
parameters, yet their role in the network remains under-explored. We show that
feed-forward layers in transformer-based language models operate as key-value
memories, where each key correlates with textual patterns in the training
examples, and each value induces a distribution over the output vocabulary. Our
experiments show that the learned patterns are human-interpretable, and that
lower layers tend to capture shallow patterns, while upper layers learn more
semantic ones. The values complement the keys&#x27; input patterns by inducing
output distributions that concentrate probability mass on tokens likely to
appear immediately after each pattern, particularly in the upper layers.
Finally, we demonstrate that the output of a feed-forward layer is a
composition of its memories, which is subsequently refined throughout the
model&#x27;s layers via residual connections to produce the final output
distribution.</span>

                    <span>This paper demonstrates that by fine-tuning an autoregressive language model
(GPT-Neo) on appropriately structured step-by-step demonstrations, it is
possible to teach it to execute a mathematical task that has previously proved
difficult for Transformers - longhand modulo operations - with a relatively
small number of examples. Specifically, we fine-tune GPT-Neo to solve the
numbers__div_remainder task from the DeepMind Mathematics Dataset; Saxton et
al. (arXiv:1904.01557) reported below 40% accuracy on this task with 2 million
training examples. We show that after fine-tuning on 200 appropriately
structured demonstrations of solving long division problems and reporting the
remainders, the smallest available GPT-Neo model achieves over 80% accuracy.
This is achieved by constructing an appropriate dataset for fine-tuning, with
no changes to the learning algorithm. These results suggest that fine-tuning
autoregressive language models on small sets of well-crafted demonstrations may
be a useful paradigm for enabling individuals without training in machine
learning to coax such models to perform some kinds of complex multi-step tasks.</span>

                    <span>Citizen-generated counter speech is a promising way to fight hate speech and
promote peaceful, non-polarized discourse. However, there is a lack of
large-scale longitudinal studies of its effectiveness for reducing hate speech.
To this end, we perform an exploratory analysis of the effectiveness of counter
speech using several different macro- and micro-level measures to analyze
180,000 political conversations that took place on German Twitter over four
years. We report on the dynamic interactions of hate and counter speech over
time and provide insights into whether, as in &#x60;classic&#x27; bullying situations,
organized efforts are more effective than independent individuals in steering
online discourse. Taken together, our results build a multifaceted picture of
the dynamics of hate and counter speech online. While we make no causal claims
due to the complexity of discourse dynamics, our findings suggest that
organized hate speech is associated with changes in public discourse and that
counter speech -- especially when organized -- may help curb hateful rhetoric
in online discourse.</span>

                    <span>Segmentation remains an important preprocessing step both in languages where
&quot;words&quot; or other important syntactic/semantic units (like morphemes) are not
clearly delineated by white space, as well as when dealing with continuous
speech data, where there is often no meaningful pause between words.
Near-perfect supervised methods have been developed for use in resource-rich
languages such as Chinese, but many of the world&#x27;s languages are both
morphologically complex, and have no large dataset of &quot;gold&quot; segmentations into
meaningful units. To solve this problem, we propose a new type of Segmental
Language Model (Sun and Deng, 2018; Kawakami et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021)
for use in both unsupervised and lightly supervised segmentation tasks. We
introduce a Masked Segmental Language Model (MSLM) built on a span-masking
transformer architecture, harnessing the power of a bi-directional masked
modeling context and attention. In a series of experiments, our model
consistently outperforms Recurrent SLMs on Chinese (PKU Corpus) in segmentation
quality, and performs similarly to the Recurrent model on English (PTB). We
conclude by discussing the different challenges posed in segmenting
phonemic-type writing systems.</span>

                    <span>Current work in named entity recognition (NER) shows that data augmentation
techniques can produce more robust models. However, most existing techniques
focus on augmenting in-domain data in low-resource scenarios where annotated
data is quite limited. In contrast, we study cross-domain data augmentation for
the NER task. We investigate the possibility of leveraging data from
high-resource domains by projecting it into the low-resource domains.
Specifically, we propose a novel neural architecture to transform the data
representation from a high-resource to a low-resource domain by learning the
patterns (e.g. style, noise, abbreviations, etc.) in the text that
differentiate them and a shared feature space where both domains are aligned.
We experiment with diverse datasets and show that transforming the data to the
low-resource domain representation achieves significant improvements over only
using data from high-resource domains.</span>

                    <span>Contextualised word embeddings is a powerful tool to detect contextual
synonyms. However, most of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning
concept extraction methods remain supervised and underexploit the potential of
the context. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised pre-training approach
which is able to detect contextual synonyms of concepts being training on the
data created by shallow matching. We apply our methodology in the sparse
multi-class setting (over 15,000 concepts) to extract phenotype information
from electronic health records. We further investigate data augmentation
techniques to address the problem of the class sparsity. Our approach achieves
a new SOTA for the unsupervised phenotype concept annotation on clinical text
on F1 and Recall outperforming the previous SOTA with a gain of up to 4.5 and
4.0 absolute points, respectively. After fine-tuning with as little as 20\% of
the labelled data, we also outperform BioBERT and ClinicalBERT. The extrinsic
evaluation on three ICU benchmarks also shows the benefit of using the
phenotypes annotated by our model as features.</span>

                    <span>Masked language modeling (MLM), a self-supervised pretraining objective, is
widely used in natural language processing for learning text representations.
MLM trains a model to predict a random sample of input tokens that have been
replaced by a [MASK] placeholder in a multi-class setting over the entire
vocabulary. When pretraining, it is common to use alongside MLM other auxiliary
objectives on the token or sequence level to improve downstream performance
(e.g. next sentence prediction). However, no previous work so far has attempted
in examining whether other simpler linguistically intuitive or not objectives
can be used standalone as main pretraining objectives. In this paper, we
explore five simple pretraining objectives based on token-level classification
tasks as replacements of MLM. Empirical results on GLUE and SQuAD show that our
proposed methods achieve comparable or better performance to MLM using a
BERT-BASE architecture. We further validate our methods using smaller models,
showing that pretraining a model with 41% of the BERT-BASE&#x27;s parameters,
BERT-MEDIUM results in only a 1% drop in GLUE scores with our best objective.</span>

                    <span>Vision-and-language (V\&amp;L) reasoning necessitates perception of visual
concepts such as objects and actions, understanding semantics and language
grounding, and reasoning about the interplay between the two modalities. One
crucial aspect of visual reasoning is spatial understanding, which involves
understanding relative locations of objects, i.e.\ implicitly learning the
geometry of the scene. In this work, we evaluate the faithfulness of V\&amp;L
models to such geometric understanding, by formulating the prediction of
pair-wise relative locations of objects as a classification as well as a
regression task. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art transformer-based
V\&amp;L models lack sufficient abilities to excel at this task. Motivated by this,
we design two objectives as proxies for 3D spatial reasoning (SR) -- object
centroid estimation, and relative position estimation, and train V\&amp;L with weak
supervision from off-the-shelf depth estimators. This leads to considerable
improvements in accuracy for the &quot;GQA&quot; visual question answering challenge (in
fully supervised, few-shot, and O.O.D settings) as well as improvements in
relative spatial reasoning. Code and data will be released

faithfulness is \textit{erasure-based} criteria. Though conceptually simple,
erasure-based criterion could inevitably introduce biases and artifacts. We
propose a new methodology to evaluate the faithfulness of explanations from the
\textit{counterfactual reasoning} perspective: the model should produce
substantially different outputs for the original input and its corresponding
counterfactual edited on a faithful feature. Specially, we introduce two
algorithms to find the proper counterfactuals in both discrete and continuous
scenarios and then use the acquired counterfactuals to measure faithfulness.
Empirical results on several datasets show that compared with existing metrics,
our proposed counterfactual evaluation method can achieve top correlation with
the ground truth under diffe</span>

zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. Previous work has shown that these models are
able to achieve cross-lingual representations when pretrained on two or more
languages with shared parameters. In this work, we provide evidence that a
model can achieve language-agnostic representations even when pretrained on a
single language. That is, we find that monolingual models pretrained and
finetuned on different languages achieve competitive performance compared to
the ones that use the same target language. Surprisingly, the models show a
similar performance on a same task regardless of the pretraining language. For

                    <span>As a kind of new expression elements, Internet memes are popular and
extensively used in online chatting scenarios since they manage to make
dialogues vivid, moving, and interesting. However, most current dialogue
researches focus on text-only dialogue tasks. In this paper, we propose a new
task named as \textbf{M}eme incorporated \textbf{O}pen-domain \textbf{D}ialogue
(MOD). Compared to previous dialogue tasks, MOD is much more challenging since
it requires the model to understand the multimodal elements as well as the
emotions behind them. To facilitate the MOD research, we construct a
large-scale open-domain multimodal dialogue dataset incorporating abundant
Internet memes into utterances. The dataset consists of $\sim$45K Chinese
conversations with $\sim$606K utterances. Each conversation contains about $13$
utterances with about $4$ Internet memes on average and each utterance equipped
with an Internet meme is annotated with the corresponding emotion. In addition,
we present a simple and effective method, which utilizes a unified generation
network to solve the MOD task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
trained on the proposed corpus is able to achieve expressive communication
including texts and memes. The corpus and models have been publicly available

                    <span>Masked language modeling (MLM) is one of the key sub-tasks in vision-language
pretraining. In the cross-modal setting, tokens in the sentence are masked at
random, and the model predicts the masked tokens given the image and the text.
In this paper, we observe several key disadvantages of MLM in this setting.
First, as captions tend to be short, in a third of the sentences no token is
sampled. Second, the majority of masked tokens are stop-words and punctuation,
leading to under-utilization of the image. We investigate a range of
alternative masking strategies specific to the cross-modal setting that address
these shortcomings, aiming for better fusion of text and image in the learned
representation. When pre-training the LXMERT model, our alternative masking
strategies consistently improve over the original masking strategy on three
downstream tasks, especially in low resource settings. Further, our
pre-training approach substantially outperforms the baseline model on a
prompt-based probing task designed to elicit image objects. These results and
our analysis indicate that our method allows for better utilization of the
training data.</span>

                    <span>How data is represented and operationalized is critical for building
computational solutions that are both effective and efficient. A common
approach is to represent data objects as binary vectors, denoted \textit{hash
codes}, which require little storage and enable efficient similarity search
through direct indexing into a hash table or through similarity computations in
an appropriate space. Due to the limited expressibility of hash codes, compared
to real-valued representations, a core open challenge is how to generate hash
codes that well capture semantic content or latent properties using a small
number of bits, while ensuring that the hash codes are distributed in a way
that does not reduce their search efficiency. State of the art methods use
representation learning for generating such hash codes, focusing on neural
autoencoder architectures where semantics are encoded into the hash codes by
learning to reconstruct the original inputs of the hash codes. This thesis
addresses the above challenge and makes a number of contributions to
representation learning that (i) improve effectiveness of hash codes through
more expressive representations and a more effective similarity measure than
the current state of the art, namely the Hamming distance, and (ii) improve
efficiency of hash codes by learning representations that are especially suited
to the choice of search method. The contributions are empirically validated on
several tasks related to similarity search and recommendation.</span>

                    <span>Active learning has emerged as a standard paradigm in areas with scarcity of
labeled training data, such as in the medical domain. Language models have
emerged as the prevalent choice of several natural language tasks due to the
performance boost offered by these models. However, in several domains, such as
medicine, the scarcity of labeled training data is a common issue. Also, these
models may not work well in cases where class imbalance is prevalent. Active
learning may prove helpful in these cases to boost the performance with a
limited label budget. To this end, we propose a novel method using sampling
techniques based on submodular optimization and optimal transport for active
learning in language models, dubbed ALLWAS. We construct a sampling strategy
based on submodular optimization of the designed objective in the gradient
domain. Furthermore, to enable learning from few samples, we propose a novel
strategy for sampling from the Wasserstein barycenters. Our empirical
evaluations on standard benchmark datasets for text classification show that
our methods perform significantly better (&gt;20% relative increase in some cases)
than existing approaches for active learning on language models.</span>

                    <span>The raw-RGB colors of a camera sensor vary due to the spectral sensitivity
differences across different sensor makes and models. This paper focuses on the
task of mapping between different sensor raw-RGB color spaces. Prior work
addressed this problem using a pairwise calibration to achieve accurate color
mapping. Although being accurate, this approach is less practical as it
requires: (1) capturing pair of images by both camera devices with a color
calibration object placed in each new scene; (2) accurate image alignment or
manual annotation of the color calibration object. This paper aims to tackle
color mapping in the raw space through a more practical setup. Specifically, we
present a semi-supervised raw-to-raw mapping method trained on a small set of
paired images alongside an unpaired set of images captured by each camera
device. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves better
results compared to other domain adaptation alternatives in addition to the
single-calibration solution. We have generated a new dataset of raw images from
two different smartphone cameras as part of this effort. Our dataset includes
unpaired and paired sets for our semi-supervised training and evaluation.</span>

                    <span>Image style transfer aims to manipulate the appearance of a source image, or
&quot;content&quot; image, to share similar texture and colors of a target &quot;style&quot; image.
Ideally, the style transfer manipulation should also preserve the semantic
content of the source image. A commonly used approach to assist in transferring
styles is based on Gram matrix optimization. One problem of Gram matrix-based
optimization is that it does not consider the correlation between colors and
their styles. Specifically, certain textures or structures should be associated
with specific colors. This is particularly challenging when the target style
image exhibits multiple style types. In this work, we propose a color-aware
multi-style transfer method that generates aesthetically pleasing results while
preserving the style-color correlation between style and generated images. We
achieve this desired outcome by introducing a simple but efficient modification
to classic Gram matrix-based style transfer optimization. A nice feature of our
method is that it enables the users to manually select the color associations
between the target style and content image for more transfer flexibility. We
validated our method with several qualitative comparisons, including a user
study conducted with 30 participants. In comparison with prior work, our method
is simple, easy to implement, and achieves visually appealing results when
targeting images that have multiple styles. Source code is available at

estimation. Given an image, we employ an Hourglass Network to infer all the
keypoints from different persons indiscriminately as well as the guiding
offsets connecting the adjacent keypoints belonging to the same persons. Then,
we greedily group the candidate keypoints into multiple human poses (if any),
utilizing the predicted guiding offsets. And we refer to this process as greedy
offset-guided keypoint grouping (GOG). Moreover, we revisit the
encoding-decoding method for the multi-person keypoint coordinates and reveal
some important facts affecting accuracy. Experiments have demonstrated the
obvious performance improvements brought by the introduced components. Our
approach is comparable to the state of the art on the challenging COCO dataset

                    <span>Incorrectly labeled examples, or label noise, is common in real-world
computer vision datasets. While the impact of label noise on learning in deep
neural networks has been studied in prior work, these studies have exclusively
focused on homogeneous label noise, i.e., the degree of label noise is the same
across all categories. However, in the real-world, label noise is often
heterogeneous, with some categories being affected to a greater extent than
others. Here, we address this gap in the literature. We hypothesized that
heterogeneous label noise would only affect the classes that had label noise
unless there was transfer from those classes to the classes without label
noise. To test this hypothesis, we designed a series of computer vision studies
using MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MS-COCO where we imposed heterogeneous
label noise during the training of multi-class, multi-task, and multi-label
systems. Our results provide evidence in support of our hypothesis: label noise
only affects the class affected by it unless there is transfer.</span>

                    <span>Many works in the recent literature introduce semantic mapping methods that
use CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to recognize semantic properties in
images. The types of properties (eg.: room size, place category, and objects)
and their classes (eg.: kitchen and bathroom, for place category) are usually
predefined and restricted to a specific task. Thus, all the visual data
acquired and processed during the construction of the maps are lost and only
the recognized semantic properties remain on the maps. In contrast, this work
introduces a topological semantic mapping method that uses deep visual features
extracted by a CNN (GoogLeNet), from 2D images captured in multiple views of
the environment as the robot operates, to create, through averages,
consolidated representations of the visual features acquired in the regions
covered by each topological node. These representations allow flexible
recognition of semantic properties of the regions and use in other visual
tasks. Experiments with a real-world indoor dataset showed that the method is
able to consolidate the visual features of regions and use them to recognize
objects and place categories as semantic properties, and to indicate the
topological location of images, with very promising results.</span>

                    <span>Video quality assessment (VQA) is now a fast-growing subject, maturing in the
full reference (FR) case, yet challenging in the exploding no reference (NR)
case. We investigate variants of the popular VMAF video quality assessment
algorithm for the FR case, using both support vector regression and feedforward
neural networks. We extend it to the NR case, using some different features but
similar learning, to develop a partially unified framework for VQA. When fully
trained, FR algorithms such as VMAF perform well on test datasets, with 90%+
match in PCC and SRCC; but for predicting performance in the wild, we
train/test from scratch for each database. With an 80/20 train/test split, we
still achieve 90%+ performance on average in both PCC and SRCC, with 8-9% gains
over VMAF. Moreover, we even get decent performance (~75%) if we ignore the
reference, treating FR as NR, partly justifying our attempts at unification. In
the true NR case, we reduce complexity vs. leading recent algorithms VIDEVAL,
RAPIQUE, yet achieve a stunning 90% in SRCC (~12% gain), while roughly matching
in PCC (78% vs. 79.6%). At lower complexities, we can still achieve 87% in

mathematical results concerning the probability distribution of image pixel
intensities characterized as generic $2D$ integer arrays. The size of the
smallest bounded region within an image is estimated for segmenting an image,
from which, the equilibrium distribution of intensities can be recovered. From
the estimated bounded regions, properties of the sub-optimal and equilibrium

systems tackle these challenges by automatic assessment of dietary intake
through machine learning methods. This survey discusses the most performing
methodologies that have been developed so far for automatic food recognition
and volume estimation. First, we will present the rationale of visual-based
methods for food recognition. The core of the paper is the presentation,
discussion and evaluation of these methods on popular food image databases.
Following that, we discussed the mobile applications that are implementing
these methods. The survey ends with a discussion of research gaps and open
issues in this area.</span>

                    <span>We introduce Neural Marching Cubes (NMC), a data-driven approach for
extracting a triangle mesh from a discretized implicit field. Classical MC is
defined by coarse tessellation templates isolated to individual cubes. While
more refined tessellations have been proposed, they all make heuristic
assumptions, such as trilinearity, when determining the vertex positions and
local mesh topologies in each cube. In principle, none of these approaches can
reconstruct geometric features that reveal coherence or dependencies between
nearby cubes (e.g., a sharp edge), as such information is unaccounted for,
resulting in poor estimates of the true underlying implicit field. To tackle
these challenges, we re-cast MC from a deep learning perspective, by designing
tessellation templates more apt at preserving geometric features, and learning
the vertex positions and mesh topologies from training meshes, to account for
contextual information from nearby cubes. We develop a compact per-cube
parameterization to represent the output triangle mesh, while being compatible
with neural processing, so that a simple 3D convolutional network can be
employed for the training. We show that all topological cases in each cube that
are applicable to our design can be easily derived using our representation,
and the resulting tessellations can also be obtained naturally and efficiently
by following a few design guidelines. In addition, our network learns local
features with limited receptive fields, hence it generalizes well to new shapes
and new datasets. We evaluate our neural MC approach by quantitative and
qualitative comparisons to all well-known MC variants. In particular, we
demonstrate the ability of our network to recover sharp features such as edges
and corners, a long-standing issue of MC and its variants. Our network also
reconstructs local mesh topologies more accurately than previous approaches.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we tackle two important problems in low-rank learning, which
are partial singular value decomposition and numerical rank estimation of huge
matrices. By using the concepts of Krylov subspaces such as Golub-Kahan
bidiagonalization (GK-bidiagonalization) as well as Ritz vectors, we propose
two methods for solving these problems in a fast and accurate way. Our
experiments show the advantages of the proposed methods compared to the
traditional and randomized singular value decomposition methods. The proposed
methods are appropriate for applications involving huge matrices where the
accuracy of the desired singular values and also all of their corresponding
singular vectors are essential. As a real application, we evaluate the
performance of our methods on the problem of Riemannian similarity learning
between two various image datasets of MNIST and USPS.</span>

                    <span>Autonomous vehicles must reason about spatial occlusions in urban
environments to ensure safety without being overly cautious. Prior work
explored occlusion inference from observed social behaviors of road agents.
Inferring occupancy from agent behaviors is an inherently multimodal problem; a
driver may behave in the same manner for different occupancy patterns ahead of
them (e.g., a driver may move at constant speed in traffic or on an open road).
Past work, however, does not account for this multimodality, thus neglecting to
model this source of aleatoric uncertainty in the relationship between driver
behaviors and their environment. We propose an occlusion inference method that
characterizes observed behaviors of human agents as sensor measurements, and
fuses them with those from a standard sensor suite. To capture the aleatoric
uncertainty, we train a conditional variational autoencoder with a discrete
latent space to learn a multimodal mapping from observed driver trajectories to
an occupancy grid representation of the view ahead of the driver. Our method
handles multi-agent scenarios, combining measurements from multiple observed
drivers using evidential theory to solve the sensor fusion problem. Our
approach is validated on a real-world dataset, outperforming baselines and
demonstrating real-time capable performance. Our code is available at

                    <span>Weakly-supervised salient object detection (WSOD) aims to develop saliency
models using image-level annotations. Despite of the success of previous works,
explorations on an effective training strategy for the saliency network and
accurate matches between image-level annotations and salient objects are still
inadequate. In this work, 1) we propose a self-calibrated training strategy by
explicitly establishing a mutual calibration loop between pseudo labels and
network predictions, liberating the saliency network from error-prone
propagation caused by pseudo labels. 2) we prove that even a much smaller
dataset (merely 1.8% of ImageNet) with well-matched annotations can facilitate
models to achieve better performance as well as generalizability. This sheds
new light on the development of WSOD and encourages more contributions to the
community. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
all the existing WSOD methods by adopting the self-calibrated strategy only.
Steady improvements are further achieved by training on the proposed dataset.
Additionally, our method achieves 94.7% of the performance of fully-supervised
methods on average. And what is more, the fully supervised models adopting our
predicted results as &quot;ground truths&quot; achieve successful results (95.6% for
BASNet and 97.3% for ITSD on F-measure), while costing only 0.32% of labeling

                    <span>From CNNs to attention mechanisms, encoding inductive biases into neural
networks has been a fruitful source of improvement in machine learning. Adding
auxiliary losses to the main objective function is a general way of encoding
biases that can help networks learn better representations. However, since
auxiliary losses are minimized only on training data, they suffer from the same
generalization gap as regular task losses. Moreover, by adding a term to the
loss function, the model optimizes a different objective than the one we care
about. In this work we address both problems: first, we take inspiration from
\textit{transductive learning} and note that after receiving an input but
before making a prediction, we can fine-tune our networks on any unsupervised
loss. We call this process {\em tailoring}, because we customize the model to
each input to ensure our prediction satisfies the inductive bias. Second, we
formulate {\em meta-tailoring}, a nested optimization similar to that in
meta-learning, and train our models to perform well on the task objective after
adapting them using an unsupervised loss. The advantages of tailoring and
meta-tailoring are discussed theoretically and demonstrated empirically on a
diverse set of examples.</span>

                    <span>Glioma is a common malignant brain tumor that shows distinct survival among
patients. The isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene mutation status provides
critical diagnostic and prognostic value for glioma and is now accepted as the
standard of care. A non-invasive prediction of IDH mutation based on the
pre-treatment MRI has crucial clinical significance. Machine learning and deep
learning models show reasonable performance in predicting IDH mutation status.
However, most models neglect the systematic brain alterations caused by tumor
invasion, where the infiltration along white matter tracts throughout the brain
is identified as a hallmark of glioma. Structural brain network provides an
effective tool to characterise brain organisation, which could be captured by
the graph neural networks (GNN) for a more accurate prediction of IDH mutation
status.

Here we propose a method to predict the IDH mutation using GNN, based on the
structural brain network of patients. Specifically, we firstly construct a
network template of healthy subjects, which consists of atlases of edges (white
matter tracts) and nodes (cortical and subcortical brain regions) to provide
regions of interest (ROI). Next, we employ autoencoders to extract the latent
multi-modal MRI features from the ROIs of the edge and node in patients. These
features of edge and node of brain networks are used to train a GNN
architecture in predicting IDH mutation status. The results show that the
proposed method outperforms the baseline models using 3D-CNN and 3D-DenseNet.
In addition, the model interpretation suggests its ability to identify the
tracts infiltrated by tumor and corresponds to clinical prior knowledge. In
conclusion, integrating brain networks with GNN offers a new avenue to study
brain lesions using computational neuroscience and computer vision approaches.</span>

                    <span>In order to extract knowledge from the large data collected by edge devices,
traditional cloud based approach that requires data upload may not be feasible
due to communication bandwidth limitation as well as privacy and security
concerns of end users. To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving
edge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.
Specifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device
individually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge
server for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the
communications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to
federated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework
does not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder
can be trained independently at each edge device without any server
involvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users&#x27; data is protected by
transmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption. Experimental
results provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various
design parameters such as the data compression ratio of the autoencoder and the
model complexity.</span>

                    <span>Masked language modeling (MLM) is one of the key sub-tasks in vision-language
pretraining. In the cross-modal setting, tokens in the sentence are masked at
random, and the model predicts the masked tokens given the image and the text.
In this paper, we observe several key disadvantages of MLM in this setting.
First, as captions tend to be short, in a third of the sentences no token is
sampled. Second, the majority of masked tokens are stop-words and punctuation,
leading to under-utilization of the image. We investigate a range of
alternative masking strategies specific to the cross-modal setting that address
these shortcomings, aiming for better fusion of text and image in the learned
representation. When pre-training the LXMERT model, our alternative masking
strategies consistently improve over the original masking strategy on three
downstream tasks, especially in low resource settings. Further, our
pre-training approach substantially outperforms the baseline model on a
prompt-based probing task designed to elicit image objects. These results and
our analysis indicate that our method allows for better utilization of the
training data.</span>

                    <span>Segmenting each moving object instance in a scene is essential for many
applications. But like many other computer vision tasks, this task performs
well in optimal weather, but then adverse weather tends to fail. To be robust
in weather conditions, the usual way is to train network in data of given
weather pattern or to fuse multiple sensors. We focus on a new possibility,
that is, to improve its resilience to weather interference through the
network&#x27;s structural design. First, we propose a novel FPN structure called
RiWFPN with a progressive top-down interaction and attention refinement module.
RiWFPN can directly replace other FPN structures to improve the robustness of
the network in non-optimal weather conditions. Then we extend SOLOV2 to capture
temporal information in video to learn motion information, and propose a moving
object instance segmentation network with RiWFPN called RiWNet. Finally, in
order to verify the effect of moving instance segmentation in different weather
disturbances, we propose a VKTTI-moving dataset which is a moving instance
segmentation dataset based on the VKTTI dataset, taking into account different
weather scenes such as rain, fog, sunset, morning as well as overcast. The
experiment proves how RiWFPN improves the network&#x27;s resilience to adverse
weather effects compared to other FPN structures. We compare RiWNet to several
other state-of-the-art methods in some challenging datasets, and RiWNet shows
better performance especially under adverse weather conditions.</span>

                    <span>While significant advancements have been made in the generation of deepfakes
using deep learning technologies, its misuse is a well-known issue now.
Deepfakes can cause severe security and privacy issues as they can be used to
impersonate a person&#x27;s identity in a video by replacing his/her face with
another person&#x27;s face. Recently, a new problem of generating synthesized human
voice of a person is emerging, where AI-based deep learning models can
synthesize any person&#x27;s voice requiring just a few seconds of audio. With the
emerging threat of impersonation attacks using deepfake audios and videos, a
new generation of deepfake detectors is needed to focus on both video and audio
collectively. A large amount of good quality datasets is typically required to
capture the real-world scenarios to develop a competent deepfake detector.
Existing deepfake datasets either contain deepfake videos or audios, which are
racially biased as well. Hence, there is a crucial need for creating a good
video as well as an audio deepfake dataset, which can be used to detect audio
and video deepfake simultaneously. To fill this gap, we propose a novel
Audio-Video Deepfake dataset (FakeAVCeleb) that contains not only deepfake
videos but also respective synthesized lip-synced fake audios. We generate this
dataset using the current most popular deepfake generation methods. We selected
real YouTube videos of celebrities with four racial backgrounds (Caucasian,
Black, East Asian, and South Asian) to develop a more realistic multimodal
dataset that addresses racial bias and further help develop multimodal deepfake
detectors. We performed several experiments using state-of-the-art detection
methods to evaluate our deepfake dataset and demonstrate the challenges and
usefulness of our multimodal Audio-Video deepfake dataset.</span>

                    <span>Detection of objects is extremely important in various aerial vision-based
applications. Over the last few years, the methods based on convolution neural
networks have made substantial progress. However, because of the large variety
of object scales, densities, and arbitrary orientations, the current detectors
struggle with the extraction of semantically strong features for small-scale
objects by a predefined convolution kernel. To address this problem, we propose
the rotation equivariant feature image pyramid network (REFIPN), an image
pyramid network based on rotation equivariance convolution. The proposed model
adopts single-shot detector in parallel with a lightweight image pyramid module
to extract representative features and generate regions of interest in an
optimization approach. The proposed network extracts feature in a wide range of
scales and orientations by using novel convolution filters. These features are
used to generate vector fields and determine the weight and angle of the
highest-scoring orientation for all spatial locations on an image. By this
approach, the performance for small-sized object detection is enhanced without
sacrificing the performance for large-sized object detection. The performance
of the proposed model is validated on two commonly used aerial benchmarks and
the results show our proposed model can achieve state-of-the-art performance
with satisfactory efficiency.</span>

                    <span>The optic nerve head represents the intraocular section of the optic nerve
(ONH), which is prone to damage by intraocular pressure. The advent of optical
coherence tomography (OCT) has enabled the evaluation of novel optic nerve head
parameters, namely the depth and curvature of the lamina cribrosa (LC).
Together with the Bruch&#x27;s membrane opening minimum-rim-width, these seem to be
promising optic nerve head parameters for diagnosis and monitoring of retinal
diseases such as glaucoma. Nonetheless, these optical coherence tomography
derived biomarkers are mostly extracted through manual segmentation, which is
time-consuming and prone to bias, thus limiting their usability in clinical
practice. The automatic segmentation of optic nerve head in OCT scans could
further improve the current clinical management of glaucoma and other diseases.

This review summarizes the current state-of-the-art in automatic segmentation
of the ONH in OCT. PubMed and Scopus were used to perform a systematic review.
Additional works from other databases (IEEE, Google Scholar and ARVO IOVS) were
also included, resulting in a total of 27 reviewed studies.

For each algorithm, the methods, the size and type of dataset used for
validation, and the respective results were carefully analyzed. The results
show that deep learning-based algorithms provide the highest accuracy,
sensitivity and specificity for segmenting the different structures of the ONH
including the LC. However, a lack of consensus regarding the definition of
segmented regions, extracted parameters and validation approaches has been
observed, highlighting the importance and need of standardized methodologies
for ONH segmentation.</span>

                    <span>Right ventricular (RV) segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is
a crucial step for cardiac morphology and function analysis. However, automatic
RV segmentation from MRI is still challenging, mainly due to the heterogeneous
intensity, the complex variable shapes, and the unclear RV boundary. Moreover,
current methods for the RV segmentation tend to suffer from performance
degradation at the basal and apical slices of MRI. In this work, we propose an
automatic RV segmentation framework, where the information from long-axis (LA)
views is utilized to assist the segmentation of short-axis (SA) views via
information transition. Specifically, we employed the transformed segmentation
from LA views as a prior information, to extract the ROI from SA views for
better segmentation. The information transition aims to remove the surrounding
ambiguous regions in the SA views. %, such as the tricuspid valve regions. We
tested our model on a public dataset with 360 multi-center, multi-vendor and
multi-disease subjects that consist of both LA and SA MRIs. Our experimental
results show that including LA views can be effective to improve the accuracy
of the SA segmentation. Our model is publicly available at

                    <span>Deep neural network pruning and quantization techniques have demonstrated it
is possible to achieve high levels of compression with surprisingly little
degradation to test set accuracy. However, this measure of performance conceals
significant differences in how different classes and images are impacted by
model compression techniques. We find that models with radically different
numbers of weights have comparable top-line performance metrics but diverge
considerably in behavior on a narrow subset of the dataset. This small subset
of data points, which we term Pruning Identified Exemplars (PIEs) are
systematically more impacted by the introduction of sparsity. Compression
disproportionately impacts model performance on the underrepresented long-tail
of the data distribution. PIEs over-index on atypical or noisy images that are
far more challenging for both humans and algorithms to classify. Our work
provides intuition into the role of capacity in deep neural networks and the
trade-offs incurred by compression. An understanding of this disparate impact
is critical given the widespread deployment of compressed models in the wild.</span>

                    <span>Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) performs non-invasive
visualization and characterization of microvasculature in research and clinical
applications mainly in ophthalmology and dermatology. A wide variety of
instruments, imaging protocols, processing methods and metrics have been used
to describe the microvasculature, such that comparing different study outcomes
is currently not feasible. With the goal of contributing to standardization of
OCTA data analysis, we report a user-friendly, open-source toolbox, OCTAVA
(OCTA Vascular Analyzer), to automate the pre-processing, segmentation, and
quantitative analysis of en face OCTA maximum intensity projection images in a
standardized workflow. We present each analysis step, including optimization of
filtering and choice of segmentation algorithm, and definition of metrics. We
perform quantitative analysis of OCTA images from different commercial and
non-commercial instruments and samples and show OCTAVA can accurately and
reproducibly determine metrics for characterization of microvasculature. Wide
adoption could enable studies and aggregation of data on a scale sufficient to
develop reliable microvascular biomarkers for early detection, and to guide
treatment, of microvascular disease.</span>

                    <span>Purpose: Echocardiography is commonly used as a non-invasive imaging tool in
clinical practice for the assessment of cardiac function. However, delineation
of the left ventricle is challenging due to the inherent properties of
ultrasound imaging, such as the presence of speckle noise and the low
signal-to-noise ratio. Methods: We propose a semi-automated segmentation
algorithm for the delineation of the left ventricle in temporal 3D
echocardiography sequences. The method requires minimal user interaction and
relies on a diffeomorphic registration approach. Advantages of the method
include no dependence on prior geometrical information, training data, or
registration from an atlas. Results: The method was evaluated using
three-dimensional ultrasound scan sequences from 18 patients from the
Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, Edmonton, Canada, and compared to manual
delineations provided by an expert cardiologist and four other registration
algorithms. The segmentation approach yielded the following results over the
cardiac cycle: a mean absolute difference of 1.01 (0.21) mm, a Hausdorff
distance of 4.41 (1.43) mm, and a Dice overlap score of 0.93 (0.02).
Conclusions: The method performed well compared to the four other registration
algorithms.</span>

                    <span>Neural networks (NNs) are widely used for object classification in autonomous
driving. However, NNs can fail on input data not well represented by the
training dataset, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) data. A mechanism to
detect OOD samples is important for safety-critical applications, such as
automotive perception, to trigger a safe fallback mode. NNs often rely on
softmax normalization for confidence estimation, which can lead to high
confidences being assigned to OOD samples, thus hindering the detection of
failures. This paper presents a method for determining whether inputs are OOD,
which does not require OOD data during training and does not increase the
computational cost of inference. The latter property is especially important in
automotive applications with limited computational resources and real-time
constraints. Our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
real-world automotive datasets.</span>

                    <span>We propose CX-ToM, short for counterfactual explanations with theory-of mind,
a new explainable AI (XAI) framework for explaining decisions made by a deep
convolutional neural network (CNN). In contrast to the current methods in XAI
that generate explanations as a single shot response, we pose explanation as an
iterative communication process, i.e. dialog, between the machine and human
user. More concretely, our CX-ToM framework generates sequence of explanations
in a dialog by mediating the differences between the minds of machine and human
user. To do this, we use Theory of Mind (ToM) which helps us in explicitly
modeling human&#x27;s intention, machine&#x27;s mind as inferred by the human as well as
human&#x27;s mind as inferred by the machine. Moreover, most state-of-the-art XAI
frameworks provide attention (or heat map) based explanations. In our work, we
show that these attention based explanations are not sufficient for increasing
human trust in the underlying CNN model. In CX-ToM, we instead use
counterfactual explanations called fault-lines which we define as follows:
given an input image I for which a CNN classification model M predicts class
c_pred, a fault-line identifies the minimal semantic-level features (e.g.,
stripes on zebra, pointed ears of dog), referred to as explainable concepts,
that need to be added to or deleted from I in order to alter the classification
category of I by M to another specified class c_alt. We argue that, due to the
iterative, conceptual and counterfactual nature of CX-ToM explanations, our
framework is practical and more natural for both expert and non-expert users to
understand the internal workings of complex deep learning models. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments verify our hypotheses, demonstrating
that our CX-ToM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art explainable AI
models.</span>

                    <span>Recent studies on the memorization effects of deep neural networks on noisy
labels show that the networks first fit the correctly-labeled training samples
before memorizing the mislabeled samples. Motivated by this early-learning
phenomenon, we propose a novel method to prevent memorization of the mislabeled
samples. Unlike the existing approaches which use the model output to identify
or ignore the mislabeled samples, we introduce an indicator branch to the
original model and enable the model to produce a confidence value for each
sample. The confidence values are incorporated in our loss function which is
learned to assign large confidence values to correctly-labeled samples and
small confidence values to mislabeled samples. We also propose an auxiliary
regularization term to further improve the robustness of the model. To improve
the performance, we gradually correct the noisy labels with a well-designed
target estimation strategy. We provide the theoretical analysis and conduct the
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that our
approach achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>Targets are essential in problems such as object tracking in cluttered or
textureless environments, camera (and multi-sensor) calibration tasks, and
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Target shapes for these tasks
typically are symmetric (square, rectangular, or circular) and work well for
structured, dense sensor data such as pixel arrays (i.e., image). However,
symmetric shapes lead to pose ambiguity when using sparse sensor data such as
LiDAR point clouds and suffer from the quantization uncertainty of the LiDAR.
This paper introduces the concept of optimizing target shape to remove pose
ambiguity for LiDAR point clouds. A target is designed to induce large
gradients at edge points under rotation and translation relative to the LiDAR
to ameliorate the quantization uncertainty associated with point cloud
sparseness. Moreover, given a target shape, we present a means that leverages
the target&#x27;s geometry to estimate the target&#x27;s vertices while globally
estimating the pose. Both the simulation and the experimental results (verified
by a motion capture system) confirm that by using the optimal shape and the
global solver, we achieve centimeter error in translation and a few degrees in
rotation even when a partially illuminated target is placed 30 meters away. All
the implementations and datasets are available at

tree crown boundary constraints and substantially improves the model
performance. Our multi-task architecture uses a shared backbone network that
learns common representations for both tasks and two task-specific decoders,

                    <span>Spiking neural network (SNN) is interesting both theoretically and
practically because of its strong bio-inspiration nature and potentially
outstanding energy efficiency. Unfortunately, its development has fallen far
behind the conventional deep neural network (DNN), mainly because of difficult
training and lack of widely accepted hardware experiment platforms. In this
paper, we show that a deep temporal-coded SNN can be trained easily and
directly over the benchmark datasets CIFAR10 and ImageNet, with testing
accuracy within 1% of the DNN of equivalent size and architecture. Training
becomes similar to DNN thanks to the closed-form solution to the spiking
waveform dynamics. Considering that SNNs should be implemented in practical
neuromorphic hardwares, we train the deep SNN with weights quantized to 8, 4, 2
bits and with weights perturbed by random noise to demonstrate its robustness
in practical applications. In addition, we develop a phase-domain signal
processing circuit schematic to implement our spiking neuron with 90% gain of
energy efficiency over existing work. This paper demonstrates that the
temporal-coded deep SNN is feasible for applications with high performance and
high energy efficient.</span>

logs via a model-based approach. A forward model of the world supervises a
driving policy that predicts the outcome of any potential driving trajectory.
To support learning from pre-recorded logs, we assume that the world is on
rails, meaning neither the agent nor its actions influence the environment.
This assumption greatly simplifies the learning problem, factorizing the
dynamics into a nonreactive world model and a low-dimensional and compact
forward model of the ego-vehicle. Our approach computes action-values for each
training trajectory using a tabular dynamic-programming evaluation of the
Bellman equations; these action-values in turn supervise the final vision-based
driving policy. Despite the world-on-rails assumption, the final driving policy
acts well in a dynamic and reactive world. At the time of writing, our method
ranks first on the CARLA leaderboard, attaining a 25% higher driving score
while using 40 times less data. Our method is also an order of magnitude more
sample-efficient than state-of-the-art model-free reinforcement learning
techniques on navigational tasks in the ProcGen benchmark.</span>

                    <span>Modern neural networks are powerful predictive models. However, when it comes
to recognizing that they may be wrong about their predictions, they perform
poorly. For example, for one of the most common activation functions, the ReLU
and its variants, even a well-calibrated model can produce incorrect but high
confidence predictions. In the related task of action recognition, most current
classification methods are based on clip-level classifiers that densely sample
a given video for non-overlapping, same-sized clips and aggregate the results
using an aggregation function - typically averaging - to achieve video level
predictions. While this approach has shown to be effective, it is sub-optimal
in recognition accuracy and has a high computational overhead. To mitigate both
these issues, we propose the confidence distillation framework to teach a
representation of uncertainty of the teacher to the student sampler and divide
the task of full video prediction between the student and the teacher models.
We conduct extensive experiments on three action recognition datasets and
demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements in action
recognition accuracy (up to 20%) and computational efficiency (more than 40%).</span>

                    <span>Instance-level image retrieval is the task of searching in a large database
for images that match an object in a query image. To address this task, systems
usually rely on a retrieval step that uses global image descriptors, and a
subsequent step that performs domain-specific refinements or reranking by
leveraging operations such as geometric verification based on local features.
In this work, we propose Reranking Transformers (RRTs) as a general model to
incorporate both local and global features to rerank the matching images in a
supervised fashion and thus replace the relatively expensive process of
geometric verification. RRTs are lightweight and can be easily parallelized so
that reranking a set of top matching results can be performed in a single
forward-pass. We perform extensive experiments on the Revisited Oxford and
Paris datasets, and the Google Landmarks v2 dataset, showing that RRTs
outperform previous reranking approaches while using much fewer local
descriptors. Moreover, we demonstrate that, unlike existing approaches, RRTs
can be optimized jointly with the feature extractor, which can lead to feature
representations tailored to downstream tasks and further accuracy improvements.

                    <span>In the recent decade, high-throughput plant phenotyping techniques, which
combine non-invasive image analysis and machine learning, have been
successfully applied to identify and quantify plant health and diseases.
However, these techniques usually do not consider the progressive nature of
plant stress and often require images showing severe signs of stress to ensure
high confidence detection, thereby reducing the feasibility for early detection
and recovery of plants under stress. To overcome the problem mentioned above,
we propose a deep learning pipeline for the temporal analysis of the visual
changes induced in the plant due to stress and apply it to the specific water
stress identification case in Chickpea plant shoot images. For this, we have
considered an image dataset of two chickpea varieties JG-62 and Pusa-372, under
three water stress conditions; control, young seedling, and before flowering,
captured over five months. We have employed a variant of Convolutional Neural
Network - Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) network to learn spatio-temporal
patterns from the chickpea plant dataset and use them for water stress
classification. Our model has achieved ceiling level classification performance
of 98.52% on JG-62 and 97.78% on Pusa-372 chickpea plant data and has
outperformed the best reported time-invariant technique by at least 14% for
both JG-62 and Pusa-372 species, to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, our
CNN-LSTM model has demonstrated robustness to noisy input, with a less than
2.5% dip in average model accuracy and a small standard deviation about the
mean for both species. Lastly, we have performed an ablation study to analyze
the performance of the CNN-LSTM model by decreasing the number of temporal
session data used for training.</span>

                    <span>Supervised deep learning-based hash and vector quantization are enabling fast
and large-scale image retrieval systems. By fully exploiting label annotations,
they are achieving outstanding retrieval performances compared to the
conventional methods. However, it is painstaking to assign labels precisely for
a vast amount of training data, and also, the annotation process is
error-prone. To tackle these issues, we propose the first deep unsupervised
image retrieval method dubbed Self-supervised Product Quantization (SPQ)
network, which is label-free and trained in a self-supervised manner. We design
a Cross Quantized Contrastive learning strategy that jointly learns codewords
and deep visual descriptors by comparing individually transformed images
(views). Our method analyzes the image contents to extract descriptive
features, allowing us to understand image representations for accurate
retrieval. By conducting extensive experiments on benchmarks, we demonstrate
that the proposed method yields state-of-the-art results even without
supervised pretraining.</span>

in recent work on developing efficient models. While committee-based models
themselves are not new, there lacks a systematic understanding of their
efficiency in comparison with single models. To fill this gap, we conduct a
comprehensive analysis of the efficiency of committee-based models. We find
that committee-based models provide a complementary paradigm to achieve
superior efficiency without tuning the architecture: even the most simplistic
method for building ensembles or cascades from existing pre-trained networks
can attain a significant speedup and higher accuracy over state-of-the-art
single models, and also outperforms sophisticated neural architecture search
methods (e.g., BigNAS). The superior efficiency of committee-based models holds
true for several tasks, including image classification, video classification,

EfficientNet, ResNet, MobileNetV2, and X3D.</span>

                    <span>Network quantization, which aims to reduce the bit-lengths of the network
weights and activations, has emerged for their deployments to resource-limited
devices. Although recent studies have successfully discretized a full-precision
network, they still incur large quantization errors after training, thus giving
rise to a significant performance gap between a full-precision network and its
quantized counterpart. In this work, we propose a novel quantization method for
neural networks, Cluster-Promoting Quantization (CPQ) that finds the optimal
quantization grids while naturally encouraging the underlying full-precision
weights to gather around those quantization grids cohesively during training.
This property of CPQ is thanks to our two main ingredients that enable
differentiable quantization: i) the use of the categorical distribution
designed by a specific probabilistic parametrization in the forward pass and
ii) our proposed multi-class straight-through estimator (STE) in the backward
pass. Since our second component, multi-class STE, is intrinsically biased, we
additionally propose a new bit-drop technique, DropBits, that revises the
standard dropout regularization to randomly drop bits instead of neurons. As a
natural extension of DropBits, we further introduce the way of learning
heterogeneous quantization levels to find proper bit-length for each layer by
imposing an additional regularization on DropBits. We experimentally validate
our method on various benchmark datasets and network architectures, and also
support a new hypothesis for quantization: learning heterogeneous quantization
levels outperforms the case using the same but fixed quantization levels from
scratch.</span>

                    <span>Adversarial attacks have been shown to be highly effective at degrading the
performance of deep neural networks (DNNs). The most prominent defense is
adversarial training, a method for learning a robust model. Nevertheless,
adversarial training does not make DNNs immune to adversarial perturbations. We
propose a novel solution by adopting the recently suggested Predictive
Normalized Maximum Likelihood. Specifically, our defense performs adversarial
targeted attacks according to different hypotheses, where each hypothesis
assumes a specific label for the test sample. Then, by comparing the hypothesis
probabilities, we predict the label. Our refinement process corresponds to
recent findings of the adversarial subspace properties. We extensively evaluate
our approach on 16 adversarial attack benchmarks using ResNet-50,
WideResNet-28, and a2-layer ConvNet trained with ImageNet, CIFAR10, and MNIST,
showing a significant improvement of up to 5.7%, 3.7%, and 0.6% respectively.</span>

                    <span>Data hiding is the procedure of encoding desired information into the cover
image to resist potential noises while ensuring the embedded image has few
perceptual perturbations from the original one. Recently, with the tremendous
successes gained by deep neural networks in various fields, the researches of
data hiding with deep learning models have attracted an increasing number of
attentions. In the data hiding task, each pixel of cover images should be
treated differently since they have divergent tolerabilities. The neglect of
considering the sensitivity of each pixel will inevitably affect the model
robustness for information hiding. Targeting this problem, we propose a novel
deep data hiding scheme with Inverse Gradient Attention (IGA), combing the
ideas of adversarial learning and attention mechanism to endow different
sensitivities for different pixels. With the proposed component, the model can
spotlight pixels with more robustness for data hiding. Empirically, extensive
experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods on two prevalent datasets under multiple evaluations. Besides, we
further identify and discuss the connections between the proposed inverse
gradient attention and high-frequency regions within images.</span>

                    <span>Moving object detection is a crucial task in computer vision. Event-based
cameras are bio-inspired cameras that work by mimicking the working of the
human eye. These cameras have multiple advantages over conventional frame-based
cameras, like reduced latency, HDR, reduced motion blur during high motion, low
power consumption, etc. However, these advantages come at a high cost, as
event-based cameras are noise sensitive and have low resolution. Moreover, the
task of moving object detection in these cameras is difficult, as event-based
sensors capture only the binary changes in brightness of a scene, lacking
useful visual features like texture and color. In this paper, we investigate
the application of the k-means clustering technique in detecting moving objects
in event-based data. Experimental results in publicly available datasets using
k-means show significant improvement in performance over the state-of-the-art

                    <span>Several approaches have been proposed in recent literature to alleviate the
long-tail problem, mainly in object classification tasks. In this paper, we
make the first large-scale study concerning the task of Long-Tail Visual
Relationship Recognition (LTVRR). LTVRR aims at improving the learning of
structured visual relationships that come from the long-tail (e.g., &quot;rabbit
grazing on grass&quot;). In this setup, the subject, relation, and object classes
each follow a long-tail distribution. To begin our study and make a future
benchmark for the community, we introduce two LTVRR-related benchmarks, dubbed
VG8K-LT and GQA-LT, built upon the widely used Visual Genome and GQA datasets.
We use these benchmarks to study the performance of several state-of-the-art
long-tail models on the LTVRR setup. Lastly, we propose a visiolinguistic
hubless (VilHub) loss and a Mixup augmentation technique adapted to LTVRR
setup, dubbed as RelMix. Both VilHub and RelMix can be easily integrated on top
of existing models and despite being simple, our results show that they can
remarkably improve the performance, especially on tail classes. Benchmarks,

                    <span>Topology matters. Despite the recent success of point cloud processing with
geometric deep learning, it remains arduous to capture the complex topologies
of point cloud data with a learning model. Given a point cloud dataset
containing objects with various genera, or scenes with multiple objects, we
propose an autoencoder, TearingNet, which tackles the challenging task of
representing the point clouds using a fixed-length descriptor. Unlike existing
works directly deforming predefined primitives of genus zero (e.g., a 2D square
patch) to an object-level point cloud, our TearingNet is characterized by a
proposed Tearing network module and a Folding network module interacting with
each other iteratively. Particularly, the Tearing network module learns the
point cloud topology explicitly. By breaking the edges of a primitive graph, it
tears the graph into patches or with holes to emulate the topology of a target
point cloud, leading to faithful reconstructions. Experimentation shows the
superiority of our proposal in terms of reconstructing point clouds as well as
generating more topology-friendly representations than benchmarks.</span>

                    <span>The COVID-19 pandemic raises the problem of adapting face recognition systems
to the new reality, where people may wear surgical masks to cover their noses
and mouths. Traditional data sets (e.g., CelebA, CASIA-WebFace) used for
training these systems were released before the pandemic, so they now seem
unsuited due to the lack of examples of people wearing masks. We propose a
method for enhancing data sets containing faces without masks by creating
synthetic masks and overlaying them on faces in the original images. Our method
relies on Spark AR Studio, a developer program made by Facebook that is used to
create Instagram face filters. In our approach, we use 9 masks of different
colors, shapes and fabrics. We employ our method to generate a number of
445,446 (90%) samples of masks for the CASIA-WebFace data set and 196,254
(96.8%) masks for the CelebA data set, releasing the mask images at
https://github.com/securifai/masked_faces. We show that our method produces
significantly more realistic training examples of masks overlaid on faces by
asking volunteers to qualitatively compare it to other methods or data sets
designed for the same task. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our method by
evaluating state-of-the-art face recognition systems (FaceNet, VGG-face,
ArcFace) trained on the enhanced data sets and showing that they outperform
equivalent systems trained on the original data sets (containing faces without
masks), when the test benchmark contains masked faces.</span>

                    <span>Learning from image-text data has demonstrated recent success for many
recognition tasks, yet is currently limited to visual features or individual
visual concepts such as objects. In this paper, we propose one of the first
methods that learn from image-sentence pairs to extract a graphical
representation of localized objects and their relationships within an image,
known as scene graph. To bridge the gap between images and texts, we leverage
an off-the-shelf object detector to identify and localize object instances,
match labels of detected regions to concepts parsed from captions, and thus
create &quot;pseudo&quot; labels for learning scene graph. Further, we design a
Transformer-based model to predict these &quot;pseudo&quot; labels via a masked token
prediction task. Learning from only image-sentence pairs, our model achieves
30% relative gain over a latest method trained with human-annotated unlocalized
scene graphs. Our model also shows strong results for weakly and fully
supervised scene graph generation. In addition, we explore an open-vocabulary
setting for detecting scene graphs, and present the first result for open-set
scene graph generation. Our code is available at

                    <span>Adversarial training (AT) has been demonstrated as one of the most promising
defense methods against various adversarial attacks. To our knowledge, existing
AT-based methods usually train with the locally most adversarial perturbed
points and treat all the perturbed points equally, which may lead to
considerably weaker adversarial robust generalization on test data. In this
work, we introduce a new adversarial training framework that considers the
diversity as well as characteristics of the perturbed points in the vicinity of
benign samples. To realize the framework, we propose a Regional Adversarial
Training (RAT) defense method that first utilizes the attack path generated by
the typical iterative attack method of projected gradient descent (PGD), and
constructs an adversarial region based on the attack path. Then, RAT samples
diverse perturbed training points efficiently inside this region, and utilizes
a distance-aware label smoothing mechanism to capture our intuition that
perturbed points at different locations should have different impact on the
model performance. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show
that RAT consistently makes significant improvement on standard adversarial
training (SAT), and exhibits better robust generalization.</span>

                    <span>The rapid development of facial manipulation techniques has aroused public
concerns in recent years. Following the success of deep learning, existing
methods always formulate DeepFake video detection as a binary classification
problem and develop frame-based and video-based solutions. However, little
attention has been paid to capturing the spatial-temporal inconsistency in
forged videos. To address this issue, we term this task as a Spatial-Temporal
Inconsistency Learning (STIL) process and instantiate it into a novel STIL
block, which consists of a Spatial Inconsistency Module (SIM), a Temporal
Inconsistency Module (TIM), and an Information Supplement Module (ISM).
Specifically, we present a novel temporal modeling paradigm in TIM by
exploiting the temporal difference over adjacent frames along with both
horizontal and vertical directions. And the ISM simultaneously utilizes the
spatial information from SIM and temporal information from TIM to establish a
more comprehensive spatial-temporal representation. Moreover, our STIL block is
flexible and could be plugged into existing 2D CNNs. Extensive experiments and
visualizations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
against the state-of-the-art competitors.</span>

                    <span>Geometric data acquired from real-world scenes, e.g., 2D depth images, 3D
point clouds, and 4D dynamic point clouds, have found a wide range of
applications including immersive telepresence, autonomous driving,
surveillance, etc. Due to irregular sampling patterns of most geometric data,
traditional image/video processing methodologies are limited, while Graph
Signal Processing (GSP) -- a fast-developing field in the signal processing
community -- enables processing signals that reside on irregular domains and
plays a critical role in numerous applications of geometric data from low-level
processing to high-level analysis. To further advance the research in this
field, we provide the first timely and comprehensive overview of GSP
methodologies for geometric data in a unified manner by bridging the
connections between geometric data and graphs, among the various geometric data
modalities, and with spectral/nodal graph filtering techniques. We also discuss
the recently developed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and interpret the operation
of these networks from the perspective of GSP. We conclude with a brief

                    <span>As a kind of new expression elements, Internet memes are popular and
extensively used in online chatting scenarios since they manage to make
dialogues vivid, moving, and interesting. However, most current dialogue
researches focus on text-only dialogue tasks. In this paper, we propose a new
task named as \textbf{M}eme incorporated \textbf{O}pen-domain \textbf{D}ialogue
(MOD). Compared to previous dialogue tasks, MOD is much more challenging since
it requires the model to understand the multimodal elements as well as the
emotions behind them. To facilitate the MOD research, we construct a
large-scale open-domain multimodal dialogue dataset incorporating abundant
Internet memes into utterances. The dataset consists of $\sim$45K Chinese
conversations with $\sim$606K utterances. Each conversation contains about $13$
utterances with about $4$ Internet memes on average and each utterance equipped
with an Internet meme is annotated with the corresponding emotion. In addition,
we present a simple and effective method, which utilizes a unified generation
network to solve the MOD task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
trained on the proposed corpus is able to achieve expressive communication
including texts and memes. The corpus and models have been publicly available

                    <span>Humans (e.g., crowdworkers) have a remarkable ability in solving different
tasks, by simply reading textual instructions that define them and looking at a
few examples. NLP models built with the conventional paradigm, however, often
struggle with generalization across tasks (e.g., a question-answering system
cannot solve classification tasks). A long-standing challenge in AI is to build
a model that is equipped with the understanding of human-readable instructions
that define the tasks, and can generalize to new tasks. To study this, we
introduce NATURAL INSTRUCTIONS, a dataset of 61 distinct tasks, their
human-authored instructions and 193k task instances. The instructions are
obtained from crowdsourcing instructions used to collect existing NLP datasets
and mapped to a unified schema. We adopt generative pre-trained language models
to encode task-specific instructions along with input and generate task output.
Our results indicate that models can benefit from instructions to generalize
across tasks. These models, however, are far behind supervised task-specific
models, indicating significant room for more progress in this direction.</span>

                    <span>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on numerous
applications. However, it is difficult to tell beforehand if a DNN receiving an
input will deliver the correct output since their decision criteria are usually
nontransparent. A DNN delivers the correct output if the input is within the
area enclosed by its generalization envelope. In this case, the information
contained in the input sample is processed reasonably by the network. It is of
large practical importance to assess at inference time if a DNN generalizes
correctly. Currently, the approaches to achieve this goal are investigated in
different problem set-ups rather independently from one another, leading to
three main research and literature fields: predictive uncertainty,
out-of-distribution detection and adversarial example detection. This survey
connects the three fields within the larger framework of investigating the
generalization performance of machine learning methods and in particular DNNs.
We underline the common ground, point at the most promising approaches and give
a structured overview of the methods that provide at inference time means to
establish if the current input is within the generalization envelope of a DNN.</span>

                    <span>Underwater 3D reconstruction is challenging due to the refraction of light at
the water-air interface (most electronic devices cannot be directly submerged
in water). In this paper, we present an underwater 3D reconstruction solution
using light field cameras. We first develop a light field camera calibration
algorithm that simultaneously estimates the camera parameters and the geometry
of the water-air interface. We then design a novel depth estimation algorithm
for 3D reconstruction. Specifically, we match correspondences on curved
epipolar lines caused by water refraction. We also observe that the
view-dependent specular reflection is very weak in the underwater environment,
resulting the angularly sampled rays in light field has uniform intensity. We
therefore propose an angular uniformity constraint for depth optimization. We
also develop a fast algorithm for locating the angular patches in presence of
non-linear light paths. Extensive synthetic and real experiments demonstrate
that our method can perform underwater 3D reconstruction with high accuracy.</span>

goals of intelligent robots. The development of 3D simulation technology

tasks. However, deep learning on embodied navigation is still in its infancy
due to the unique challenges faced by the navigation exploration and learning

to tackle different challenges in this area. To give a promising direction for

                    <span>Modern real-world application scenarios like Internet services consist of a
diversity of AI and non-AI modules with huge code sizes and long and
complicated execution paths, which raises serious benchmarking or evaluating
challenges. Using AI components or micro benchmarks alone can lead to
error-prone conclusions. This paper presents a methodology to attack the above
challenge. We formalize a real-world application scenario as a Directed Acyclic
Graph-based model and propose the rules to distill it into a permutation of
essential AI and non-AI tasks, which we call a scenario benchmark. Together
with seventeen industry partners, we extract nine typical scenario benchmarks.
We design and implement an extensible, configurable, and flexible benchmark
framework. We implement two Internet service AI scenario benchmarks based on
the framework as proxies to two real-world application scenarios. We consider
scenario, component, and micro benchmarks as three indispensable parts for
evaluating. Our evaluation shows the advantage of our methodology against using
component or micro AI benchmarks alone. The specifications, source code,

                    <span>Traffic accident anticipation aims to accurately and promptly predict the
occurrence of a future accident from dashcam videos, which is vital for a
safety-guaranteed self-driving system. To encourage an early and accurate
decision, existing approaches typically focus on capturing the cues of spatial
and temporal context before a future accident occurs. However, their
decision-making lacks visual explanation and ignores the dynamic interaction
with the environment. In this paper, we propose Deep ReInforced accident
anticipation with Visual Explanation, named DRIVE. The method simulates both
the bottom-up and top-down visual attention mechanism in a dashcam observation
environment so that the decision from the proposed stochastic multi-task agent
can be visually explained by attentive regions. Moreover, the proposed dense
anticipation reward and sparse fixation reward are effective in training the
DRIVE model with our improved reinforcement learning algorithm. Experimental
results show that the DRIVE model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
multiple real-world traffic accident datasets. Code and pre-trained model are

                    <span>Multi-view representation learning captures comprehensive information from
multiple views of a shared context. Recent works intuitively apply contrastive
learning (CL) to learn representations, regarded as a pairwise manner, which is
still scalable: view-specific noise is not filtered in learning view-shared
representations; the fake negative pairs, where the negative terms are actually
within the same class as the positive, and the real negative pairs are
coequally treated; and evenly measuring the similarities between terms might
interfere with optimization. Importantly, few works research the theoretical
framework of generalized self-supervised multi-view learning, especially for
more than two views. To this end, we rethink the existing multi-view learning
paradigm from the information theoretical perspective and then propose a novel
information theoretical framework for generalized multi-view learning. Guided
by it, we build a multi-view coding method with a three-tier progressive
architecture, namely Information theory-guided heuristic Progressive Multi-view
Coding (IPMC). In the distribution-tier, IPMC aligns the distribution between
views to reduce view-specific noise. In the set-tier, IPMC builds self-adjusted
pools for contrasting, which utilizes a view filter to adaptively modify the
pools. Lastly, in the instance-tier, we adopt a designed unified loss to learn
discriminative representations and reduce the gradient interference.
Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate the superiority of IPMC over
state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>Crowd estimation is a very challenging problem. The most recent study tries
to exploit auditory information to aid the visual models, however, the
performance is limited due to the lack of an effective approach for feature
extraction and integration. The paper proposes a new audiovisual multi-task
network to address the critical challenges in crowd counting by effectively
utilizing both visual and audio inputs for better modalities association and
productive feature extraction. The proposed network introduces the notion of
auxiliary and explicit image patch-importance ranking (PIR) and patch-wise
crowd estimate (PCE) information to produce a third (run-time) modality. These
modalities (audio, visual, run-time) undergo a transformer-inspired
cross-modality co-attention mechanism to finally output the crowd estimate. To
acquire rich visual features, we propose a multi-branch structure with
transformer-style fusion in-between. Extensive experimental evaluations show
that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art networks under all
evaluation settings with up to 33.8% improvement. We also analyze and compare
the vision-only variant of our network and empirically demonstrate its
superiority over previous approaches.</span>

better dataset, with respect to annotation quality. Differentiable ray tracing
has not been employed so far to relevant problems and is hereby shown to be
superior to the approximative alternatives that have been employed in the past.
To tackle the lack of reliable ground truth, as far as quantitative evaluation
is concerned, we resort to realistic synthetic data, to show that the
improvement we induce is indeed significant. The same becomes evident in real
data through visual evaluation.</span>

                    <span>Representing human-made objects as a collection of base primitives has a long
history in computer vision and reverse engineering. In the case of
high-resolution point cloud scans, the challenge is to be able to detect both
large primitives as well as those explaining the detailed parts. While the
classical RANSAC approach requires case-specific parameter tuning,
state-of-the-art networks are limited by memory consumption of their backbone
modules such as PointNet++, and hence fail to detect the fine-scale primitives.
We present Cascaded Primitive Fitting Networks (CPFN) that relies on an
adaptive patch sampling network to assemble detection results of global and
local primitive detection networks. As a key enabler, we present a merging
formulation that dynamically aggregates the primitives across global and local
scales. Our evaluation demonstrates that CPFN improves the state-of-the-art
SPFN performance by 13-14% on high-resolution point cloud datasets and
specifically improves the detection of fine-scale primitives by 20-22%.</span>

                    <span>Image compression is a method to remove spatial redundancy between adjacent
pixels and reconstruct a high-quality image. In the past few years, deep
learning has gained huge attention from the research community and produced
promising image reconstruction results. Therefore, recent methods focused on
developing deeper and more complex networks, which significantly increased
network complexity. In this paper, two effective novel blocks are developed:
analysis and synthesis block that employs the convolution layer and Generalized
Divisive Normalization (GDN) in the variable-rate encoder and decoder side. Our
network utilizes a pixel RNN approach for quantization. Furthermore, to improve
the whole network, we encode a residual image using LSTM cells to reduce
unnecessary information. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed
variable-rate framework with novel blocks outperforms existing methods and
standard image codecs, such as George&#x27;s ~\cite{002} and JPEG in terms of image
similarity. The project page along with code and models are available at

                    <span>Hyperspectral images (HSI) consist of rich spatial and spectral information,
which can potentially be used for several applications. However, noise, band
correlations and high dimensionality restrict the applicability of such data.
This is recently addressed using creative deep learning network architectures
such as ResNet, SSRN, and A2S2K. However, the last layer, i.e the
classification layer, remains unchanged and is taken to be the softmax
classifier. In this article, we propose to use a watershed classifier.
Watershed classifier extends the watershed operator from Mathematical
Morphology for classification. In its vanilla form, the watershed classifier
does not have any trainable parameters. In this article, we propose a novel
approach to train deep learning networks to obtain representations suitable for
the watershed classifier. The watershed classifier exploits the connectivity
patterns, a characteristic of HSI datasets, for better inference. We show that
exploiting such characteristics allows the Triplet-Watershed to achieve
state-of-art results in supervised and semi-supervised contexts. These results
are validated on Indianpines (IP), University of Pavia (UP), Kennedy Space
Center (KSC) and University of Houston (UH) datasets, relying on simple convnet
architecture using a quarter of parameters compared to previous
state-of-the-art networks. The source code for reproducing the experiments and
supplementary material (high resolution images) is available at

                    <span>An effective perception system is a fundamental component for farming robots,
as it enables them to properly perceive the surrounding environment and to
carry out targeted operations. The most recent methods make use of
state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to learn a valid model for the
target task. However, those techniques need a large amount of labeled data for
training. A recent approach to deal with this issue is data augmentation
through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), where entire synthetic scenes
are added to the training data, thus enlarging and diversifying their
informative content. In this work, we propose an alternative solution with
respect to the common data augmentation methods, applying it to the fundamental
problem of crop/weed segmentation in precision farming. Starting from real
images, we create semi-artificial samples by replacing the most relevant object
classes (i.e., crop and weeds) with their synthesized counterparts. To do that,
we employ a conditional GAN (cGAN), where the generative model is trained by
conditioning the shape of the generated object. Moreover, in addition to RGB
data, we take into account also near-infrared (NIR) information, generating
four channel multi-spectral synthetic images. Quantitative experiments, carried
out on three publicly available datasets, show that (i) our model is capable of
generating realistic multi-spectral images of plants and (ii) the usage of such
synthetic images in the training process improves the segmentation performance
of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation convolutional networks.</span>

applications in computer vision and robotics for solving non-convex
optimization problems involving rotations? In studying the empirical
performance we note that there are few failure cases reported in the
literature, in particular for estimation problems with a single rotation,
motivating us to gain further theoretical understanding.

A general framework based on tools from algebraic geometry is introduced for
analyzing the power of semidefinite relaxations of problems with quadratic
objective functions and rotational constraints. Applications include
registration, hand-eye calibration and rotation averaging. We characterize the
extreme points, and show that there exist failure cases for which the
relaxation is not tight, even in the case of a single rotation. We also show
that some problem classes are always tight given an appropriate
parametrization. Our theoretical findings are accompanied with numerical
simulations, providing further evidence and understanding of the results.</span>

                    <span>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has become a popular framework for learning
implicit 3D representations and addressing different tasks such as novel-view
synthesis or depth-map estimation. However, in downstream applications where
decisions need to be made based on automatic predictions, it is critical to
leverage the confidence associated with the model estimations. Whereas
uncertainty quantification is a long-standing problem in Machine Learning, it
has been largely overlooked in the recent NeRF literature. In this context, we
propose Stochastic Neural Radiance Fields (S-NeRF), a generalization of
standard NeRF that learns a probability distribution over all the possible
radiance fields modeling the scene. This distribution allows to quantify the
uncertainty associated with the scene information provided by the model. S-NeRF
optimization is posed as a Bayesian learning problem which is efficiently
addressed using the Variational Inference framework. Exhaustive experiments
over benchmark datasets demonstrate that S-NeRF is able to provide more
reliable predictions and confidence values than generic approaches previously
proposed for uncertainty estimation in other domains.</span>

                    <span>In this manuscript, we introduce a semi-automatic scene graph annotation tool
for images, the GeneAnnotator. This software allows human annotators to
describe the existing relationships between participators in the visual scene
in the form of directed graphs, hence enabling the learning and reasoning on
visual relationships, e.g., image captioning, VQA and scene graph generation,
etc. The annotations for certain image datasets could either be merged in a
single VG150 data-format file to support most existing models for scene graph
learning or transformed into a separated annotation file for each single image
to build customized datasets. Moreover, GeneAnnotator provides a rule-based
relationship recommending algorithm to reduce the heavy annotation workload.
With GeneAnnotator, we propose Traffic Genome, a comprehensive scene graph
dataset with 1000 diverse traffic images, which in return validates the
effectiveness of the proposed software for scene graph annotation. The project

method to capture class-exclusive context information. Specifically, we design
a spatial-temporal consistency loss to constrain the semantic consistency in
spatial and temporal dimensions. In addition, we adopt an pseudo-labeling

58.85% mIoU on development (test part 1) and testing set of VSPW, respectively.

                    <span>Online continual learning for image classification studies the problem of
learning to classify images from an online stream of data and tasks, where
tasks may include new classes (class incremental) or data nonstationarity
(domain incremental). One of the key challenges of continual learning is to
avoid catastrophic forgetting (CF), i.e., forgetting old tasks in the presence
of more recent tasks. Over the past few years, many methods and tricks have
been introduced to address this problem, but many have not been fairly and
systematically compared under a variety of realistic and practical settings. To
better understand the relative advantages of various approaches and the
settings where they work best, this survey aims to (1) compare state-of-the-art
methods such as MIR, iCARL, and GDumb and determine which works best at
different experimental settings; (2) determine if the best class incremental
methods are also competitive in domain incremental setting; (3) evaluate the
performance of 7 simple but effective trick such as &quot;review&quot; trick and nearest
class mean (NCM) classifier to assess their relative impact. Regarding (1), we
observe iCaRL remains competitive when the memory buffer is small; GDumb
outperforms many recently proposed methods in medium-size datasets and MIR
performs the best in larger-scale datasets. For (2), we note that GDumb
performs quite poorly while MIR -- already competitive for (1) -- is also
strongly competitive in this very different but important setting. Overall,
this allows us to conclude that MIR is overall a strong and versatile method
across a wide variety of settings. For (3), we find that all 7 tricks are
beneficial, and when augmented with the &quot;review&quot; trick and NCM classifier, MIR
produces performance levels that bring online continual learning much closer to
its ultimate goal of matching offline training.</span>

                    <span>Segmentation plays a crucial role in diagnosis. Studying the retinal
vasculatures from fundus images help identify early signs of many crucial
illnesses such as diabetic retinopathy. Due to the varying shape, size, and
patterns of retinal vessels, along with artefacts and noises in fundus images,
no one-stage method can accurately segment retinal vessels. In this work, we
propose a multi-scale, multi-level attention embedded CNN architecture
((M)SLAe-Net) to address the issue of multi-stage processing for robust and
precise segmentation of retinal vessels. We do this by extracting features at
multiple scales and multiple levels of the network, enabling our model to
holistically extracts the local and global features. Multi-scale features are
extracted using our novel dynamic dilated pyramid pooling (D-DPP) module. We
also aggregate the features from all the network levels. These effectively
resolved the issues of varying shapes and artefacts and hence the need for
multiple stages. To assist in better pixel-level classification, we use the
Squeeze and Attention(SA) module, a smartly adapted version of the Squeeze and
Excitation(SE) module for segmentation tasks in our network to facilitate
pixel-group attention. Our unique network design and novel D-DPP module with
efficient task-specific loss function for thin vessels enabled our model for
better cross data performance. Exhaustive experimental results on DRIVE, STARE,
HRF, and CHASE-DB1 show the superiority of our method.</span>

combination of Siamese networks and radial basis function networks to perform
data-efficient classification without pretraining by measuring the distance
between images in semantic space in a data-efficient manner. We develop the
models using three technical datasets, the NEU dataset, the BSD dataset, and
the TEX dataset. In addition to the technical domain, we show the general
applicability to classical datasets (cifar10 and MNIST) as well. The approach
is tested against state-of-the-art models (Resnet50 and Resnet101) by stepwise
reduction of the number of samples available for training. The authors show

                    <span>The use of mobiles phones when driving have been a major factor when it comes
to road traffic incidents and the process of capturing such violations can be a
laborious task. Advancements in both modern object detection frameworks and
high-performance hardware has paved the way for a more automated approach when
it comes to video surveillance. In this work, we propose a custom-trained
state-of-the-art object detector to work with roadside cameras to capture
driver phone usage without the need for human intervention. The proposed
approach also addresses the issues caused by windscreen glare and introduces
the steps required to remedy this. Twelve pre-trained models are fine-tuned
with our custom dataset using four popular object detection methods: YOLO, SSD,
Faster R-CNN, and CenterNet. Out of all the object detectors tested, the YOLO
yields the highest accuracy levels of up to 96% (AP10) and frame rates of up to
~30 FPS. DeepSort object tracking algorithm is also integrated into the
best-performing model to collect records of only the unique violations, and
enable the proposed approach to count the number of vehicles. The proposed
automated system will collect the output images of the identified violations,
timestamps of each violation, and total vehicle count. Data can be accessed via

                    <span>In this paper, we investigate the problem of facial kinship verification by
learning hierarchical reasoning graph networks. Conventional methods usually
focus on learning discriminative features for each facial image of a paired
sample and neglect how to fuse the obtained two facial image features and
reason about the relations between them. To address this, we propose a
Star-shaped Reasoning Graph Network (S-RGN). Our S-RGN first constructs a
star-shaped graph where each surrounding node encodes the information of
comparisons in a feature dimension and the central node is employed as the
bridge for the interaction of surrounding nodes. Then we perform relational
reasoning on this star graph with iterative message passing. The proposed S-RGN
uses only one central node to analyze and process information from all
surrounding nodes, which limits its reasoning capacity. We further develop a
Hierarchical Reasoning Graph Network (H-RGN) to exploit more powerful and
flexible capacity. More specifically, our H-RGN introduces a set of latent
reasoning nodes and constructs a hierarchical graph with them. Then bottom-up
comparative information abstraction and top-down comprehensive signal
propagation are iteratively performed on the hierarchical graph to update the
node features. Extensive experimental results on four widely used kinship
databases show that the proposed methods achieve very competitive results.</span>

                    <span>We consider the problem of achieving fair classification in Federated
Learning (FL) under data heterogeneity. Most of the approaches proposed for
fair classification require diverse data that represent the different
demographic groups involved. In contrast, it is common for each client to own
data that represents only a single demographic group. Hence the existing
approaches cannot be adopted for fair classification models at the client
level. To resolve this challenge, we propose several aggregation techniques. We
empirically validate these techniques by comparing the resulting fairness
metrics and accuracy on CelebA, UTK, and FairFace datasets.</span>

                    <span>The goal of object navigation is to reach the expected objects according to
visual information in the unseen environments. Previous works usually implement
deep models to train an agent to predict actions in real-time. However, in the
unseen environment, when the target object is not in egocentric view, the agent
may not be able to make wise decisions due to the lack of guidance. In this
paper, we propose a hierarchical object-to-zone (HOZ) graph to guide the agent
in a coarse-to-fine manner, and an online-learning mechanism is also proposed
to update HOZ according to the real-time observation in new environments. In
particular, the HOZ graph is composed of scene nodes, zone nodes and object
nodes. With the pre-learned HOZ graph, the real-time observation and the target
goal, the agent can constantly plan an optimal path from zone to zone. In the
estimated path, the next potential zone is regarded as sub-goal, which is also
fed into the deep reinforcement learning model for action prediction. Our
methods are evaluated on the AI2-Thor simulator. In addition to widely used
evaluation metrics SR and SPL, we also propose a new evaluation metric of SAE
that focuses on the effective action rate. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.</span>

                    <span>Purpose: Static cardiac imaging such as late gadolinium enhancement, mapping,
or 3-D coronary angiography require prior information, e.g., the phase during a
cardiac cycle with least motion, called resting phase (RP). The purpose of this
work is to propose a fully automated framework that allows the detection of the
right coronary artery (RCA) RP within CINE series. Methods: The proposed
prototype system consists of three main steps. First, the localization of the
regions of interest (ROI) is performed. Second, as CINE series are
time-resolved, the cropped ROI series over all time points are taken for
tracking motions quantitatively. Third, the output motion values are used to
classify RPs. In this work, we focused on the detection of the area with the
outer edge of the cross-section of the RCA as our target. The proposed
framework was evaluated on 102 clinically acquired dataset at 1.5T and 3T. The
automatically classified RPs were compared with the ground truth RPs annotated
manually by a medical expert for testing the robustness and feasibility of the
framework. Results: The predicted RCA RPs showed high agreement with the
experts annotated RPs with 92.7% accuracy, 90.5% sensitivity and 95.0%
specificity for the unseen study dataset. The mean absolute difference of the
start and end RP was 13.6 ${\pm}$ 18.6 ms for the validation study dataset
(n&#x3D;102). Conclusion: In this work, automated RP detection has been introduced
by the proposed framework and demonstrated feasibility, robustness, and
applicability for diverse static imaging acquisitions.</span>

                    <span>Model compression techniques are recently gaining explosive attention for
obtaining efficient AI models for various real-time applications. Channel
pruning is one important compression strategy and is widely used in slimming
various DNNs. Previous gate-based or importance-based pruning methods aim to
remove channels whose importance is smallest. However, it remains unclear what
criteria the channel importance should be measured on, leading to various
channel selection heuristics. Some other sampling-based pruning methods deploy
sampling strategies to train sub-nets, which often causes the training
instability and the compressed model&#x27;s degraded performance. In view of the
research gaps, we present a new module named Gates with Differentiable
Polarization (GDP), inspired by principled optimization ideas. GDP can be
plugged before convolutional layers without bells and whistles, to control the
on-and-off of each channel or whole layer block. During the training process,
the polarization effect will drive a subset of gates to smoothly decrease to
exact zero, while other gates gradually stay away from zero by a large margin.
When training terminates, those zero-gated channels can be painlessly removed,
while other non-zero gates can be absorbed into the succeeding convolution
kernel, causing completely no interruption to training nor damage to the
trained model. Experiments conducted over CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets show
that the proposed GDP algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance on
various benchmark DNNs at a broad range of pruning ratios. We also apply GDP to
DeepLabV3Plus-ResNet50 on the challenging Pascal VOC segmentation task, whose
test performance sees no drop (even slightly improved) with over 60% FLOPs
saving.</span>

                    <span>Deep person generation has attracted extensive research attention due to its
wide applications in virtual agents, video conferencing, online shopping and
art/movie production. With the advancement of deep learning, visual appearances
(face, pose, cloth) of a person image can be easily generated or manipulated on
demand. In this survey, we first summarize the scope of person generation, and
then systematically review recent progress and technical trends in deep person
generation, covering three major tasks: talking-head generation (face),
pose-guided person generation (pose) and garment-oriented person generation
(cloth). More than two hundred papers are covered for a thorough overview, and
the milestone works are highlighted to witness the major technical
breakthrough. Based on these fundamental tasks, a number of applications are
investigated, e.g., virtual fitting, digital human, generative data
augmentation. We hope this survey could shed some light on the future prospects
of deep person generation, and provide a helpful foundation for full
applications towards digital human.</span>

                    <span>Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM) has been a popular
algorithmic framework for separable optimization problems with linear
constraints. For numerical ADMM fail to exploit the particular structure of the
problem at hand nor the input data information, leveraging task-specific
modules (e.g., neural networks and other data-driven architectures) to extend
ADMM is a significant but challenging task. This work focuses on designing a
flexible algorithmic framework to incorporate various task-specific modules
(with no additional constraints) to improve the performance of ADMM in
real-world applications. Specifically, we propose Guidance from Optimality
(GO), a new customization strategy, to embed task-specific modules into ADMM
(GO-ADMM). By introducing an optimality-based criterion to guide the
propagation, GO-ADMM establishes an updating scheme agnostic to the choice of
additional modules. The existing task-specific methods just plug their
task-specific modules into the numerical iterations in a straightforward
manner. Even with some restrictive constraints on the plug-in modules, they can
only obtain some relatively weaker convergence properties for the resulted ADMM
iterations. Fortunately, without any restrictions on the embedded modules, we
prove the convergence of GO-ADMM regarding objective values and constraint
violations, and derive the worst-case convergence rate measured by iteration
complexity. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical
results and demonstrate the efficiency of GO-ADMM.</span>

spatial-temporal representation of a dynamic scene from a set of RGB images.
Key to our approach is the use of a neural implicit representation that learns
to capture the 3D occupancy, radiance, and dynamics of the scene. By enforcing
consistency across different modalities, our representation enables multi-view
rendering in diverse dynamic scenes, including water pouring, robotic
interaction, and real images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods for
spatial-temporal view synthesis. Our approach works even when inputs images are
captured with only one camera. We further demonstrate that the learned
representation can serve as an implicit scene prior, enabling video processing
tasks such as image super-resolution and de-noising without any additional
supervision.</span>

                    <span>In this paper we focus on landscape animation, which aims to generate
time-lapse videos from a single landscape image. Motion is crucial for
landscape animation as it determines how objects move in videos. Existing
methods are able to generate appealing videos by learning motion from real
time-lapse videos. However, current methods suffer from inaccurate motion
generation, which leads to unrealistic video results. To tackle this problem,
we propose a model named FGLA to generate high-quality and realistic videos by
learning Fine-Grained motion embedding for Landscape Animation. Our model
consists of two parts: (1) a motion encoder which embeds time-lapse motion in a
fine-grained way. (2) a motion generator which generates realistic motion to
animate input images. To train and evaluate on diverse time-lapse videos, we
build the largest high-resolution Time-lapse video dataset with Diverse scenes,
namely Time-lapse-D, which includes 16,874 video clips with over 10 million
frames. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the
superiority of our method. In particular, our method achieves relative
improvements by 19% on LIPIS and 5.6% on FVD compared with state-of-the-art
methods on our dataset. A user study carried out with 700 human subjects shows
that our approach visually outperforms existing methods by a large margin.</span>

the subtle traces introduced by this operation. For example, despite
refinements to camera optics, lenses will leave behind certain clues, notably
chromatic aberration and vignetting. Photographers also leave behind other
clues relating to image aesthetics and scene composition. We study how to
detect these traces, and investigate the impact that cropping has on the image
distribution. While our aim is to dissect the fundamental impact of spatial

an effective architecture for scaling attention-based models to more parameters

the recent MLP-Mixer model with sparse MoE layers, to achieve a more
computation-efficient architecture. We replace a subset of dense MLP blocks in
the MLP-Mixer model with Sparse blocks. In each Sparse block, we apply two
stages of MoE layers: one with MLP experts mixing information within channels
along image patch dimension, one with MLP experts mixing information within
patches along the channel dimension. Besides, to reduce computational cost in
routing and improve experts capacity, we design Re-represent layers in each
Sparse block. These layers are to re-scale image representations by two simple

                    <span>The rapid emergence of high-dimensional data in various areas has brought new
challenges to current ensemble clustering research. To deal with the curse of
dimensionality, recently considerable efforts in ensemble clustering have been
made by means of different subspace-based techniques. However, besides the
emphasis on subspaces, rather limited attention has been paid to the potential
diversity in similarity/dissimilarity metrics. It remains a surprisingly open
problem in ensemble clustering how to create and aggregate a large population
of diversified metrics, and furthermore, how to jointly investigate the
multi-level diversity in the large populations of metrics, subspaces, and
clusters in a unified framework. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a
novel multidiversified ensemble clustering approach. In particular, we create a
large number of diversified metrics by randomizing a scaled exponential
similarity kernel, which are then coupled with random subspaces to form a large
set of metric-subspace pairs. Based on the similarity matrices derived from
these metric-subspace pairs, an ensemble of diversified base clusterings can
thereby be constructed. Further, an entropy-based criterion is utilized to
explore the cluster-wise diversity in ensembles, based on which three specific
ensemble clustering algorithms are presented by incorporating three types of
consensus functions. Extensive experiments are conducted on 30 high-dimensional
datasets, including 18 cancer gene expression datasets and 12 image/speech
datasets, which demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms over the
state-of-the-art. The source code is available at

                    <span>In this paper we propose a novel square root sliding-window bundle adjustment
suitable for real-time odometry applications. The square root formulation
pervades three major aspects of our optimization-based sliding-window
estimator: for bundle adjustment we eliminate landmark variables with nullspace
projection; to store the marginalization prior we employ a matrix square root
of the Hessian; and when marginalizing old poses we avoid forming normal
equations and update the square root prior directly with a specialized QR
decomposition. We show that the proposed square root marginalization is
algebraically equivalent to the conventional use of Schur complement (SC) on
the Hessian. Moreover, it elegantly deals with rank-deficient Jacobians
producing a prior equivalent to SC with Moore-Penrose inverse. Our evaluation
of visual and visual-inertial odometry on real-world datasets demonstrates that
the proposed estimator is 36% faster than the baseline. It furthermore shows
that in single precision, conventional Hessian-based marginalization leads to
numeric failures and reduced accuracy. We analyse numeric properties of the
marginalization prior to explain why our square root form does not suffer from
the same effect and therefore entails superior performance.</span>

farm industrialists to shift towards automated and mechanized approaches. The
key component for autonomous systems is the path planning techniques used.
Coverage path planning (CPP) algorithm is used for navigating over farmlands to
perform various agricultural operations such as seeding, ploughing, or spraying
pesticides and fertilizers. This report paper compares novel algorithms for
autonomous navigation of farmlands. For reduction of navigational constraints,
a high-resolution grid map representation is taken into consideration specific
to Indian environments. The free space is covered by distinguishing the grid
cells as covered, unexplored, partially explored and presence of an obstacle.
The performance of the compared algorithms is evaluated with metrics such as
time efficiency, space efficiency, accuracy, and robustness to changes in the

                    <span>Visual emotion analysis (VEA) has attracted great attention recently, due to
the increasing tendency of expressing and understanding emotions through images
on social networks. Different from traditional vision tasks, VEA is inherently
more challenging since it involves a much higher level of complexity and
ambiguity in human cognitive process. Most of the existing methods adopt deep
learning techniques to extract general features from the whole image,
disregarding the specific features evoked by various emotional stimuli.
Inspired by the \textit{Stimuli-Organism-Response (S-O-R)} emotion model in
psychological theory, we proposed a stimuli-aware VEA method consisting of
three stages, namely stimuli selection (S), feature extraction (O) and emotion
prediction (R). First, specific emotional stimuli (i.e., color, object, face)
are selected from images by employing the off-the-shelf tools. To the best of
our knowledge, it is the first time to introduce stimuli selection process into
VEA in an end-to-end network. Then, we design three specific networks, i.e.,
Global-Net, Semantic-Net and Expression-Net, to extract distinct emotional
features from different stimuli simultaneously. Finally, benefiting from the
inherent structure of Mikel&#x27;s wheel, we design a novel hierarchical
cross-entropy loss to distinguish hard false examples from easy ones in an
emotion-specific manner. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on four public visual
emotion datasets. Ablation study and visualizations further prove the validity
and interpretability of our method.</span>

                    <span>The recent achievements of Deep Learning rely on the test data being similar
in distribution to the training data. In an ideal case, Deep Learning models
would achieve Out-of-Distribution (OoD) Generalization, i.e. reliably make
predictions on out-of-distribution data. Yet in practice, models usually fail
to generalize well when facing a shift in distribution. Several methods were
thereby designed to improve the robustness of the features learned by a model
through Regularization- or Domain-Prediction-based schemes. Segmenting medical
images such as MRIs of the hippocampus is essential for the diagnosis and
treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. But these brain images often suffer
from distribution shift due to the patient&#x27;s age and various pathologies
affecting the shape of the organ. In this work, we evaluate OoD Generalization
solutions for the problem of hippocampus segmentation in MR data using both
fully- and semi-supervised training. We find that no method performs reliably
in all experiments. Only the V-REx loss stands out as it remains easy to tune,
while it outperforms a standard U-Net in most cases.</span>

Chest (CXR) as a complementary screening technique to RT-PCR testing grows to
its clinical use for respiratory complaints. Many new deep learning approaches
have developed as a consequence. The goal of this research is to assess the
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to diagnosis COVID-19 utisizing X-ray
images of chest. The performance of CNN with one, three, and four convolution
layers has been evaluated in this research. A dataset of 13,808 CXR photographs
are used in this research. When evaluated on X-ray images with three splits of
the dataset, our preliminary experimental results show that the CNN model with
three convolution layers can reliably detect with 96 percent accuracy
(precision being 96 percent). This fact indicates the commitment of our
suggested model for reliable screening of COVID-19.</span>

dramatically slow down the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. We
present a novel fever-screening system, F3S, that uses edge machine learning
techniques to accurately measure core body temperatures of multiple individuals
in a free-flow setting. F3S performs real-time sensor fusion of visual camera
with thermal camera data streams to detect elevated body temperature, and it
has several unique features: (a) visual and thermal streams represent very
different modalities, and we dynamically associate semantically-equivalent
regions across visual and thermal frames by using a new, dynamic alignment
technique that analyzes content and context in real-time, (b) we track people
through occlusions, identify the eye (inner canthus), forehead, face and head
regions where possible, and provide an accurate temperature reading by using a
prioritized refinement algorithm, and (c) we robustly detect elevated body
temperature even in the presence of personal protective equipment like masks,
or sunglasses or hats, all of which can be affected by hot weather and lead to
spurious temperature readings. F3S has been deployed at over a dozen large
commercial establishments, providing contact-less, free-flow, real-time fever
screening for thousands of employees and customers in indoors and outdoor
settings.</span>

                    <span>Event cameras are novel sensors that perceive the per-pixel intensity changes
and output asynchronous event streams with high dynamic range and less motion
blur. It has been shown that events alone can be used for end-task learning,
\eg, semantic segmentation, based on encoder-decoder-like networks. However, as
events are sparse and mostly reflect edge information, it is difficult to
recover original details merely relying on the decoder. Moreover, most methods
resort to pixel-wise loss alone for supervision, which might be insufficient to
fully exploit the visual details from sparse events, thus leading to less
optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet flexible two-stream
framework named Dual Transfer Learning (DTL) to effectively enhance the
performance on the end-tasks without adding extra inference cost. The proposed
approach consists of three parts: event to end-task learning (EEL) branch,
event to image translation (EIT) branch, and transfer learning (TL) module that
simultaneously explores the feature-level affinity information and pixel-level
knowledge from the EIT branch to improve the EEL branch. This simple yet novel
method leads to strong representation learning from events and is evidenced by
the significant performance boost on the end-tasks such as semantic
segmentation and depth estimation.</span>

                    <span>Sleep stage classification is essential for sleep assessment and disease
diagnosis. Although previous attempts to classify sleep stages have achieved
high classification performance, several challenges remain open: 1) How to
effectively utilize time-varying spatial and temporal features from
multi-channel brain signals remains challenging. Prior works have not been able
to fully utilize the spatial topological information among brain regions. 2)
Due to the many differences found in individual biological signals, how to
overcome the differences of subjects and improve the generalization of deep
neural networks is important. 3) Most deep learning methods ignore the
interpretability of the model to the brain. To address the above challenges, we
propose a multi-view spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks (MSTGCN)
with domain generalization for sleep stage classification. Specifically, we
construct two brain view graphs for MSTGCN based on the functional connectivity
and physical distance proximity of the brain regions. The MSTGCN consists of
graph convolutions for extracting spatial features and temporal convolutions
for capturing the transition rules among sleep stages. In addition, attention
mechanism is employed for capturing the most relevant spatial-temporal
information for sleep stage classification. Finally, domain generalization and
MSTGCN are integrated into a unified framework to extract subject-invariant
sleep features. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that the
proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</span>

                    <span>3D hand-mesh reconstruction from RGB images facilitates many applications,
including augmented reality (AR). However, this requires not only real-time
speed and accurate hand pose and shape but also plausible mesh-image alignment.
While existing works already achieve promising results, meeting all three
requirements is very challenging. This paper presents a novel pipeline by
decoupling the hand-mesh reconstruction task into three stages: a joint stage
to predict hand joints and segmentation; a mesh stage to predict a rough hand
mesh; and a refine stage to fine-tune it with an offset mesh for mesh-image
alignment. With careful design in the network structure and in the loss
functions, we can promote high-quality finger-level mesh-image alignment and
drive the models together to deliver real-time predictions. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
quality of our results outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on
hand-mesh/pose precision and hand-image alignment. In the end, we also showcase
several real-time AR scenarios.</span>

                    <span>CodeNeRF is an implicit 3D neural representation that learns the variation of
object shapes and textures across a category and can be trained, from a set of
posed images, to synthesize novel views of unseen objects. Unlike the original
NeRF, which is scene specific, CodeNeRF learns to disentangle shape and texture
by learning separate embeddings. At test time, given a single unposed image of
an unseen object, CodeNeRF jointly estimates camera viewpoint, and shape and
appearance codes via optimization. Unseen objects can be reconstructed from a
single image, and then rendered from new viewpoints or their shape and texture
edited by varying the latent codes. We conduct experiments on the SRN
benchmark, which show that CodeNeRF generalises well to unseen objects and
achieves on-par performance with methods that require known camera pose at test
time. Our results on real-world images demonstrate that CodeNeRF can bridge the
sim-to-real gap. Project page: \url{https://github.com/wayne1123/code-nerf}</span>

                    <span>In a complex urban scene, observation from a single sensor unavoidably leads
to voids in observations, failing to describe urban objects in a comprehensive
manner. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal-spectral-angular
observation model to integrate observations from UAV and mobile mapping vehicle
platform, realizing a joint, coordinated observation operation from both air
and ground. We develop a multi-source remote sensing data acquisition system to
effectively acquire multi-angle data of complex urban scenes. Multi-source data
fusion solves the missing data problem caused by occlusion and achieves
accurate, rapid, and complete collection of holographic spatial and temporal
information in complex urban scenes. We carried out an experiment on Baisha
Town, Chongqing, China and obtained multi-sensor, multi-angle data from UAV and
mobile mapping vehicle. We first extracted the point cloud from UAV and then
integrated the UAV and mobile mapping vehicle point cloud. The integrated
results combined both the characteristic of UAV and mobile mapping vehicle
point cloud, confirming the practicability of the proposed joint data
acquisition platform and the effectiveness of spatio-temporal-spectral-angular
observation model. Compared with the observation from UAV or mobile mapping
vehicle alone, the integrated system provides an effective data acquisition
solution towards comprehensive urban monitoring.</span>

                    <span>Catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge while learning new
tasks is a widely observed limitation of contemporary neural networks. Although
many continual learning methods are proposed to mitigate this drawback, the
main question remains unanswered: what is the root cause of catastrophic
forgetting? In this work, we aim at answering this question by posing and
validating a set of research hypotheses related to the specificity of
representations built internally by neural models. More specifically, we design
a set of empirical evaluations that compare the robustness of representations
in discriminative and generative models against catastrophic forgetting. We
observe that representations learned by discriminative models are more prone to
catastrophic forgetting than their generative counterparts, which sheds new
light on the advantages of developing generative models for continual learning.
Finally, our work opens new research pathways and possibilities to adopt
generative models in continual learning beyond mere replay mechanisms.</span>

                    <span>Personalized video highlight detection aims to shorten a long video to
interesting moments according to a user&#x27;s preference, which has recently raised
the community&#x27;s attention. Current methods regard the user&#x27;s history as
holistic information to predict the user&#x27;s preference but negating the inherent
diversity of the user&#x27;s interests, resulting in vague preference
representation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient preference
reasoning framework (PR-Net) to explicitly take the diverse interests into
account for frame-level highlight prediction. Specifically, distinct
user-specific preferences for each input query frame are produced, presented as
the similarity weighted sum of history highlights to the corresponding query
frame. Next, distinct comprehensive preferences are formed by the user-specific
preferences and a learnable generic preference for more overall highlight
measurement. Lastly, the degree of highlight and non-highlight for each query
frame is calculated as semantic similarity to its comprehensive and
non-highlight preferences, respectively. Besides, to alleviate the ambiguity
due to the incomplete annotation, a new bi-directional contrastive loss is
proposed to ensure a compact and differentiable metric space. In this way, our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a relative
improvement of 12% in mean accuracy precision.</span>

GAN-based techniques have been successful in generating and manipulating
natural images, their application to the medical domain, however, is still in
its infancy. Working with the CheXpert data set, we show that StyleGAN can be
trained to generate realistic chest X-rays. Inspired by the Cyclic Reverse
Generator (CRG) framework, we train an encoder that allows for faithfully
inverting the generator on synthetic X-rays and provides organ-level
reconstructions of real ones. Employing a guided manipulation of latent codes,
we confer the medical condition of cardiomegaly (increased heart size) onto

                    <span>Object detection on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is still a challenging
task. The recordings are mostly sparse and contain only small objects. In this
work, we propose a simple tiling method that improves the detection capability
in the remote sensing case without modifying the model itself. By reducing the
background bias and enabling the usage of higher image resolutions during
training, our method can improve the performance of models substantially. The
procedure was validated on three different data sets and outperformed similar
approaches in performance and speed.</span>

                    <span>We unveil a long-standing problem in the prevailing co-saliency detection
systems: there is indeed inconsistency between training and testing.
Constructing a high-quality co-saliency detection dataset involves
time-consuming and labor-intensive pixel-level labeling, which has forced most
recent works to rely instead on semantic segmentation or saliency detection
datasets for training. However, the lack of proper co-saliency and the absence
of multiple foreground objects in these datasets can lead to spurious
variations and inherent biases learned by models. To tackle this, we introduce
the idea of counterfactual training through context adjustment, and propose a
&quot;cost-free&quot; group-cut-paste (GCP) procedure to leverage images from
off-the-shelf saliency detection datasets and synthesize new samples. Following
GCP, we collect a novel dataset called Context Adjustment Training (CAT). CAT
consists of 33,500 images, making it four times larger than the current
co-saliency detection datasets. All images are automatically annotated with
high-quality mask annotations, object categories, and edge maps. Extensive
experiments with state-of-the-art models are conducted to demonstrate the
superiority of our dataset. We hope that the scale, diversity, and quality of
our dataset can benefit researchers in this area and beyond. The dataset and
benchmark toolkit will be publicly accessible through our project page.</span>

                    <span>Radiomics is an active area of research focusing on high throughput feature
extraction from medical images with a wide array of applications in clinical
practice, such as clinical decision support in oncology. However, noise in low
dose computed tomography (CT) scans can impair the accurate extraction of
radiomic features. In this article, we investigate the possibility of using
deep learning generative models to improve the performance of radiomics from
low dose CTs. We used two datasets of low dose CT scans -NSCLC Radiogenomics
and LIDC-IDRI - as test datasets for two tasks - pre-treatment survival
prediction and lung cancer diagnosis. We used encoder-decoder networks and
conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) trained in a previous study
as generative models to transform low dose CT images into full dose CT images.
Radiomic features extracted from the original and improved CT scans were used
to build two classifiers - a support vector machine (SVM) and a deep attention
based multiple instance learning model - for survival prediction and lung
cancer diagnosis respectively. Finally, we compared the performance of the
models derived from the original and improved CT scans. Encoder-decoder
networks and CGANs improved the area under the curve (AUC) of survival
prediction from 0.52 to 0.57 (p-value&lt;0.01). On the other hand, Encoder-decoder
network and CGAN can improve the AUC of lung cancer diagnosis from 0.84 to 0.88
and 0.89 respectively (p-value&lt;0.01). Moreover, there are no statistically
significant differences in improving AUC by using encoder-decoder network and
CGAN (p-value&#x3D;0.34) when networks trained at 75 and 100 epochs. Generative
models can improve the performance of low dose CT-based radiomics in different
tasks. Hence, denoising using generative models seems to be a necessary
pre-processing step for calculating radiomic features from low dose CTs.</span>

                    <span>Multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is an emerging optical imaging
method providing multiplex molecular and functional information from the rodent
brain. It can be greatly augmented by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that
offers excellent soft-tissue contrast and high-resolution brain anatomy.
Nevertheless, registration of multi-modal images remains challenging, chiefly
due to the entirely different image contrast rendered by these modalities.
Previously reported registration algorithms mostly relied on manual
user-dependent brain segmentation, which compromised data interpretation and
accurate quantification. Here we propose a fully automated registration method
for MSOT-MRI multimodal imaging empowered by deep learning. The automated
workflow includes neural network-based image segmentation to generate suitable
masks, which are subsequently registered using an additional neural network.
Performance of the algorithm is showcased with datasets acquired by
cross-sectional MSOT and high-field MRI preclinical scanners. The automated
registration method is further validated with manual and half-automated
registration, demonstrating its robustness and accuracy.</span>

                    <span>Dynamic imaging is a beneficial tool for interventions to assess
physiological changes. Nonetheless during dynamic MRI, while achieving a high
temporal resolution, the spatial resolution is compromised. To overcome this
spatio-temporal trade-off, this research presents a super-resolution (SR) MRI
reconstruction with prior knowledge based fine-tuning to maximise spatial
information while reducing the required scan-time for dynamic MRIs. An U-Net
based network with perceptual loss is trained on a benchmark dataset and
fine-tuned using one subject-specific static high resolution MRI as prior
knowledge to obtain high resolution dynamic images during the inference stage.
3D dynamic data for three subjects were acquired with different parameters to
test the generalisation capabilities of the network. The method was tested for
different levels of in-plane undersampling for dynamic MRI. The reconstructed
dynamic SR results after fine-tuning showed higher similarity with the high
resolution ground-truth, while quantitatively achieving statistically
significant improvement. The average SSIM of the lowest resolution experimented
during this research (6.25~\% of the k-space) before and after fine-tuning were
0.939 $\pm$ 0.008 and 0.957 $\pm$ 0.006 respectively. This could theoretically
result in an acceleration factor of 16, which can potentially be acquired in
less than half a second. The proposed approach shows that the super-resolution
MRI reconstruction with prior-information can alleviate the spatio-temporal
trade-off in dynamic MRI, even for high acceleration factors.</span>

                    <span>Semantic segmentation is a classic computer vision task with multiple
applications, which includes medical and remote sensing image analysis. Despite
recent advances with deep-based approaches, labeling samples (pixels) for
training models is laborious and, in some cases, unfeasible. In this paper, we
present two novel meta learning methods, named WeaSeL and ProtoSeg, for the
few-shot semantic segmentation task with sparse annotations. We conducted
extensive evaluation of the proposed methods in different applications (12
datasets) in medical imaging and agricultural remote sensing, which are very
distinct fields of knowledge and usually subject to data scarcity. The results
demonstrated the potential of our method, achieving suitable results for
segmenting both coffee/orange crops and anatomical parts of the human body in
comparison with full dense annotation.</span>

                    <span>Consider a scenario where we are supplied with a number of ready-to-use
models trained on a certain source domain and hope to directly apply the most
appropriate ones to different target domains based on the models&#x27; relative
performance. Ideally we should annotate a validation set for model performance
assessment on each new target environment, but such annotations are often very
expensive. Under this circumstance, we introduce the problem of ranking models
in unlabeled new environments. For this problem, we propose to adopt a proxy
dataset that 1) is fully labeled and 2) well reflects the true model rankings
in a given target environment, and use the performance rankings on the proxy
sets as surrogates. We first select labeled datasets as the proxy.
Specifically, datasets that are more similar to the unlabeled target domain are
found to better preserve the relative performance rankings. Motivated by this,
we further propose to search the proxy set by sampling images from various
datasets that have similar distributions as the target. We analyze the problem
and its solutions on the person re-identification (re-ID) task, for which
sufficient datasets are publicly available, and show that a carefully
constructed proxy set effectively captures relative performance ranking in new
environments. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/sxzrt/Proxy-Set}.</span>

                    <span>In recent years Deep Learning reached significant results in many practical
problems, such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech
recognition and many others. For many years the main goal of the research was
to improve the quality of models, even if the complexity was impractically
high. However, for the production solutions, which often require real-time
work, the latency of the model plays a very important role. Current
state-of-the-art architectures are found with neural architecture search (NAS)
taking model complexity into account. However, designing of the search space
suitable for specific hardware is still a challenging task. To address this
problem we propose a measure of hardware efficiency of neural architecture
search space - matrix efficiency measure (MEM); a search space comprising of
hardware-efficient operations; a latency-aware scaling method; and ISyNet - a
set of architectures designed to be fast on the specialized neural processing
unit (NPU) hardware and accurate at the same time. We show the advantage of the
designed architectures for the NPU devices on ImageNet and the generalization
ability for the downstream classification and detection tasks.</span>

                    <span>Human activity recognition plays an increasingly important role not only in
our daily lives, but also in the medical and rehabilitation fields. The
development of deep learning has also contributed to the advancement of human
activity recognition, but the large amount of data annotation work required to
train deep learning models is a major obstacle to the development of human
activity recognition. Contrastive learning has started to be used in the field
of sensor-based human activity recognition due to its ability to avoid the cost
of labeling large datasets and its ability to better distinguish between sample
representations of different instances. Among them, data augmentation, an
important part of contrast learning, has a significant impact on model
effectiveness, but current data augmentation methods do not perform too
successfully in contrast learning frameworks for wearable sensor-based activity
recognition. To optimize the effect of contrast learning models, in this paper,
we investigate the sampling frequency of sensors and propose a resampling data
augmentation method. In addition, we also propose a contrast learning framework
based on human activity recognition and apply the resampling augmentation
method to the data augmentation phase of contrast learning. The experimental
results show that the resampling augmentation method outperforms supervised
learning by 9.88% on UCI HAR and 7.69% on Motion Sensor in the fine-tuning
evaluation of contrast learning with a small amount of labeled data, and also
reveal that not all data augmentation methods will have positive effects in the
contrast learning framework. Finally, we explored the influence of the
combination of different augmentation methods on contrastive learning, and the
experimental results showed that the effect of most combination augmentation
methods was better than that of single augmentation.</span>

retrieve a similar object from a category database, and the local features are
used for robust pose registration between the observed and the retrieved

for matching. We present results from synthetic and real-world datasets with

                    <span>GAN-based techniques that generate and synthesize realistic faces have caused
severe social concerns and security problems. Existing methods for detecting
GAN-generated faces can perform well on limited public datasets. However,
images from existing public datasets do not represent real-world scenarios well
enough in terms of view variations and data distributions (where real faces
largely outnumber synthetic faces). The state-of-the-art methods do not
generalize well in real-world problems and lack the interpretability of
detection results. Performance of existing GAN-face detection models degrades
significantly when facing imbalanced data distributions. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a robust, attentive, end-to-end network that can spot
GAN-generated faces by analyzing their eye inconsistencies. Specifically, our
model learns to identify inconsistent eye components by localizing and
comparing the iris artifacts between the two eyes automatically. Our deep
network addresses the imbalance learning issues by considering the AUC loss and
the traditional cross-entropy loss jointly. Comprehensive evaluations of the
FFHQ dataset in terms of both balanced and imbalanced scenarios demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method.</span>

                    <span>Hatching is a common method used by artists to accentuate the third dimension
of a sketch, and to illuminate the scene. Our system SHAD3S attempts to compete
with a human at hatching generic three-dimensional (3D) shapes, and also tries
to assist her in a form exploration exercise. The novelty of our approach lies
in the fact that we make no assumptions about the input other than that it
represents a 3D shape, and yet, given a contextual information of illumination
and texture, we synthesise an accurate hatch pattern over the sketch, without
access to 3D or pseudo 3D. In the process, we contribute towards a) a cheap yet
effective method to synthesise a sufficiently large high fidelity dataset,
pertinent to task; b) creating a pipeline with conditional generative
adversarial network (CGAN); and c) creating an interactive utility with GIMP,
that is a tool for artists to engage with automated hatching or a
form-exploration exercise. User evaluation of the tool suggests that the model
performance does generalise satisfactorily over diverse input, both in terms of
style as well as shape. A simple comparison of inception scores suggest that
the generated distribution is as diverse as the ground truth.</span>

                    <span>Multimodal self-supervised learning is getting more and more attention as it
allows not only to train large networks without human supervision but also to
search and retrieve data across various modalities. In this context, this paper
proposes a self-supervised training framework that learns a common multimodal
embedding space that, in addition to sharing representations across different
modalities, enforces a grouping of semantically similar instances. To this end,
we extend the concept of instance-level contrastive learning with a multimodal
clustering step in the training pipeline to capture semantic similarities
across modalities. The resulting embedding space enables retrieval of samples
across all modalities, even from unseen datasets and different domains. To
evaluate our approach, we train our model on the HowTo100M dataset and evaluate
its zero-shot retrieval capabilities in two challenging domains, namely
text-to-video retrieval, and temporal action localization, showing
state-of-the-art results on four different datasets.</span>

descriptors are then calculated as image descriptors by using the codebook. In
contrast, in the proposed scheme, a codebook is generated from a dataset
independent of uploaded images. The use of an independent dataset enables us
not only to use a codebook that does not require recalculation but also to
constantly provide a high retrieval accuracy. In an experiment, the proposed
scheme is demonstrated to maintain a high retrieval performance, even if
codebooks are generated from a plain image dataset independent of image owners&#x27;
encrypted images.</span>

                    <span>Extracting informative features from images has been of capital importance in
computer vision. In this paper, we propose a way to extract such features from
images by a method based on algebraic topology. To that end, we construct a
weighted graph from an image, which extracts local information of an image. By
considering this weighted graph as a pseudo-metric space, we construct a
Vietoris-Rips complex with a parameter $\varepsilon$ by a well-known process of
algebraic topology. We can extract information of complexity of the image and
can detect a sub-image with a relatively high concentration of information from
this Vietoris-Rips complex. The parameter $\varepsilon$ of the Vietoris-Rips
complex produces robustness to noise. We empirically show that the extracted
feature captures well images&#x27; characteristics.</span>

                    <span>Recovering the 3D structure of an object from a single image is a challenging
task due to its ill-posed nature. One approach is to utilize the plentiful
photos of the same object category to learn a strong 3D shape prior for the
object. This approach has successfully been demonstrated by a recent work of Wu
et al. (2020), which obtained impressive 3D reconstruction networks with
unsupervised learning. However, their algorithm is only applicable to symmetric
objects. In this paper, we eliminate the symmetry requirement with a novel
unsupervised algorithm that can learn a 3D reconstruction network from a
multi-image dataset. Our algorithm is more general and covers the
symmetry-required scenario as a special case. Besides, we employ a novel albedo
loss that improves the reconstructed details and realisticity. Our method
surpasses the previous work in both quality and robustness, as shown in
experiments on datasets of various structures, including single-view,
multi-view, image-collection, and video sets.</span>

                    <span>The spatial attention mechanism captures long-range dependencies by
aggregating global contextual information to each query location, which is
beneficial for semantic segmentation. In this paper, we present a sparse
spatial attention network (SSANet) to improve the efficiency of the spatial
attention mechanism without sacrificing the performance. Specifically, a sparse
non-local (SNL) block is proposed to sample a subset of key and value elements
for each query element to capture long-range relations adaptively and generate
a sparse affinity matrix to aggregate contextual information efficiently.
Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms other context
aggregation methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
Cityscapes, PASCAL Context and ADE20K datasets.</span>

                    <span>This paper tackles the problem of table structure parsing (TSP) from images
in the wild. In contrast to existing studies that mainly focus on parsing
well-aligned tabular images with simple layouts from scanned PDF documents, we
aim to establish a practical table structure parsing system for real-world
scenarios where tabular input images are taken or scanned with severe
deformation, bending or occlusions. For designing such a system, we propose an
approach named Cycle-CenterNet on the top of CenterNet with a novel
cycle-pairing module to simultaneously detect and group tabular cells into
structured tables. In the cycle-pairing module, a new pairing loss function is
proposed for the network training. Alongside with our Cycle-CenterNet, we also
present a large-scale dataset, named Wired Table in the Wild (WTW), which
includes well-annotated structure parsing of multiple style tables in several
scenes like the photo, scanning files, web pages, \emph{etc.}. In experiments,
we demonstrate that our Cycle-CenterNet consistently achieves the best accuracy
of table structure parsing on the new WTW dataset by 24.6\% absolute
improvement evaluated by the TEDS metric. A more comprehensive experimental
analysis also validates the advantages of our proposed methods for the TSP
task.</span>

                    <span>In practice, and more especially when training deep neural networks, visual
recognition rules are often learned based on various sources of information. On
the other hand, the recent deployment of facial recognition systems with uneven
predictive performances on different population segments highlights the
representativeness issues possibly induced by a naive aggregation of image
datasets. Indeed, sampling bias does not vanish simply by considering larger
datasets, and ignoring its impact may completely jeopardize the generalization
capacity of the learned prediction rules. In this paper, we show how biasing
models, originally introduced for nonparametric estimation in (Gill et al.,
1988), and recently revisited from the perspective of statistical learning
theory in (Laforgue and Cl\&#x27;emen\c{c}on, 2019), can be applied to remedy these
problems in the context of visual recognition. Based on the (approximate)
knowledge of the biasing mechanisms at work, our approach consists in
reweighting the observations, so as to form a nearly debiased estimator of the
target distribution. One key condition for our method to be theoretically valid
is that the supports of the distributions generating the biased datasets at
disposal must overlap, and cover the support of the target distribution. In
order to meet this requirement in practice, we propose to use a low dimensional
image representation, shared across the image databases. Finally, we provide
numerical experiments highlighting the relevance of our approach whenever the
biasing functions are appropriately chosen.</span>

                    <span>Anomaly detection in computer vision is the task of identifying images which
deviate from a set of normal images. A common approach is to train deep
convolutional autoencoders to inpaint covered parts of an image and compare the
output with the original image. By training on anomaly-free samples only, the
model is assumed to not being able to reconstruct anomalous regions properly.
For anomaly detection by inpainting we suggest it to be beneficial to
incorporate information from potentially distant regions. In particular we pose
anomaly detection as a patch-inpainting problem and propose to solve it with a
purely self-attention based approach discarding convolutions. The proposed
Inpainting Transformer (InTra) is trained to inpaint covered patches in a large
sequence of image patches, thereby integrating information across large regions
of the input image. When training from scratch, in comparison to other methods
not using extra training data, InTra achieves results on par with the current
state-of-the-art on the MVTec AD dataset for detection and surpassing them on
segmentation.</span>

                    <span>This research project investigates the application of deep learning to timbre
transfer, where the timbre of a source audio can be converted to the timbre of
a target audio with minimal loss in quality. The adopted approach combines
Variational Autoencoders with Generative Adversarial Networks to construct
meaningful representations of the source audio and produce realistic
generations of the target audio and is applied to the Flickr 8k Audio dataset
for transferring the vocal timbre between speakers and the URMP dataset for
transferring the musical timbre between instruments. Furthermore, variations of
the adopted approach are trained, and generalised performance is compared using
the metrics SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) and FAD (Frech\&#x27;et Audio
Distance). It was found that a many-to-many approach supersedes a one-to-one
approach in terms of reconstructive capabilities, and that the adoption of a
basic over a bottleneck residual block design is more suitable for enriching
content information about a latent space. It was also found that the decision
on whether cyclic loss takes on a variational autoencoder or vanilla
autoencoder approach does not have a significant impact on reconstructive and
adversarial translation aspects of the model.</span>

                    <span>Hyperspectral image has become increasingly crucial due to its abundant
spectral information. However, It has poor spatial resolution with the
limitation of the current imaging mechanism. Nowadays, many convolutional
neural networks have been proposed for the hyperspectral image super-resolution
problem. However, convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods only
consider the local information instead of the global one with the limited
kernel size of receptive field in the convolution operation. In this paper, we
design a network based on the transformer for fusing the low-resolution
hyperspectral images and high-resolution multispectral images to obtain the
high-resolution hyperspectral images. Thanks to the representing ability of the
transformer, our approach is able to explore the intrinsic relationships of
features globally. Furthermore, considering the LR-HSIs hold the main spectral
structure, the network focuses on the spatial detail estimation releasing from
the burden of reconstructing the whole data. It reduces the mapping space of
the proposed network, which enhances the final performance. Various experiments
and quality indexes show our approach&#x27;s superiority compared with other

                    <span>3D human shape and pose estimation is the essential task for human motion
analysis, which is widely used in many 3D applications. However, existing
methods cannot simultaneously capture the relations at multiple levels,
including spatial-temporal level and human joint level. Therefore they fail to
make accurate predictions in some hard scenarios when there is cluttered
background, occlusion, or extreme pose. To this end, we propose Multi-level
Attention Encoder-Decoder Network (MAED), including a Spatial-Temporal Encoder
(STE) and a Kinematic Topology Decoder (KTD) to model multi-level attentions in
a unified framework. STE consists of a series of cascaded blocks based on
Multi-Head Self-Attention, and each block uses two parallel branches to learn
spatial and temporal attention respectively. Meanwhile, KTD aims at modeling
the joint level attention. It regards pose estimation as a top-down
hierarchical process similar to SMPL kinematic tree. With the training set of
3DPW, MAED outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 6.2, 7.2, and 2.4
mm of PA-MPJPE on the three widely used benchmarks 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and

                    <span>In multi-object detection using neural networks, the fundamental problem is,
&quot;How should the network learn a variable number of bounding boxes in different
input images?&quot;. Previous methods train a multi-object detection network through
a procedure that directly assigns the ground truth bounding boxes to the
specific locations of the network&#x27;s output. However, this procedure makes the
training of a multi-object detection network too heuristic and complicated. In
this paper, we reformulate the multi-object detection task as a problem of
density estimation of bounding boxes. Instead of assigning each ground truth to
specific locations of network&#x27;s output, we train a network by estimating the
probability density of bounding boxes in an input image using a mixture model.
For this purpose, we propose a novel network for object detection called
Mixture Density Object Detector (MDOD), and the corresponding objective
function for the density-estimation-based training. We applied MDOD to MS COCO
dataset. Our proposed method not only deals with multi-object detection
problems in a new approach, but also improves detection performances through
MDOD. The code is available: https://github.com/yoojy31/MDOD.</span>

                    <span>Large pre-trained models such as CLIP offer consistent accuracy across a
range of data distributions when performing zero-shot inference (i.e., without
fine-tuning on a specific dataset). Although existing fine-tuning approaches
substantially improve accuracy in-distribution, they also reduce
out-of-distribution robustness. We address this tension by introducing a simple
and effective method for improving robustness: ensembling the weights of the
zero-shot and fine-tuned models. Compared to standard fine-tuning, the
resulting weight-space ensembles provide large accuracy improvements
out-of-distribution, while matching or improving in-distribution accuracy. On
ImageNet and five derived distribution shifts, weight-space ensembles improve
out-of-distribution accuracy by 2 to 10 percentage points while increasing
in-distribution accuracy by nearly 1 percentage point relative to standard
fine-tuning. These improvements come at no additional computational cost during
fine-tuning or inference.</span>

                    <span>Precisely detection of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles(UAVs) plays a critical role
in UAV defense systems. Deep learning is widely adopted for UAV object
detection whereas researches on this topic are limited by the amount of dataset
and small scale of UAV. To tackle these problems, a novel comprehensive
approach that combines transfer learning based on simulation data and adaptive
fusion is proposed. Firstly, the open-source plugin AirSim proposed by
Microsoft is used to generate mass realistic simulation data. Secondly,
transfer learning is applied to obtain a pre-trained YOLOv5 model on the
simulated dataset and fine-tuned model on the real-world dataset. Finally, an
adaptive fusion mechanism is proposed to further improve small object detection
performance. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of
simulation-based transfer learning which leads to a 2.7% performance increase
on UAV object detection. Furthermore, with transfer learning and adaptive
fusion mechanism, 7.1% improvement is achieved compared to the original YOLO v5

                    <span>Using only a model that was trained to predict where people look at images,
and no additional training data, we can produce a range of powerful editing
effects for reducing distraction in images. Given an image and a mask
specifying the region to edit, we backpropagate through a state-of-the-art
saliency model to parameterize a differentiable editing operator, such that the
saliency within the masked region is reduced. We demonstrate several operators,
including: a recoloring operator, which learns to apply a color transform that
camouflages and blends distractors into their surroundings; a warping operator,
which warps less salient image regions to cover distractors, gradually
collapsing objects into themselves and effectively removing them (an effect
akin to inpainting); a GAN operator, which uses a semantic prior to fully
replace image regions with plausible, less salient alternatives. The resulting
effects are consistent with cognitive research on the human visual system
(e.g., since color mismatch is salient, the recoloring operator learns to
harmonize objects&#x27; colors with their surrounding to reduce their saliency),
and, importantly, are all achieved solely through the guidance of the
pretrained saliency model, with no additional supervision. We present results
on a variety of natural images and conduct a perceptual study to evaluate and

consisting of a Mask-RCNN detector, followed by a classification ensemble
consisting of ResNet50 and DenseNet201 to refine detected mitotic candidates.
The MIDOG training data consists of 200 frames originating from four scanners,
three of which are annotated for mitotic instances with centroid annotations.
Our main algorithmic choices are as follows: first, to enhance the
generalizability of our detector and classification networks, we use a
state-of-the-art residual Cycle-GAN to transform each scanner domain to every
other scanner domain. During training, we then randomly load, for each image,
one of the four domains. In this way, our networks can learn from the fourth
non-annotated scanner domain even if we don&#x27;t have annotations for it. Second,
for training the detector network, rather than using centroid-based fixed-size
bounding boxes, we create mitosis-specific bounding boxes. We do this by
manually annotating a small selection of mitoses, training a Mask-RCNN on this
small dataset, and applying it to the rest of the data to obtain full
annotations. We trained the follow-up classification ensemble using only the
challenge-provided positive and hard-negative examples. On the preliminary test
set, the algorithm scores an F1 score of 0.7578, putting us as the second-place
team on the leaderboard.</span>

                    <span>We propose a highly parallel primal-dual algorithm for the multicut (a.k.a.
correlation clustering) problem, a classical graph clustering problem widely
used in machine learning and computer vision. Our algorithm consists of three
steps executed recursively: (1) Finding conflicted cycles that correspond to
violated inequalities of the underlying multicut relaxation, (2) Performing
message passing between the edges and cycles to optimize the Lagrange
relaxation coming from the found violated cycles producing reduced costs and
(3) Contracting edges with high reduced costs through matrix-matrix
multiplications.

Our algorithm produces primal solutions and dual lower bounds that estimate
the distance to optimum. We implement our algorithm on GPUs and show resulting
one to two order-of-magnitudes improvements in execution speed without
sacrificing solution quality compared to traditional serial algorithms that run
on CPUs. We can solve very large scale benchmark problems with up to
$\mathcal{O}(10^8)$ variables in a few seconds with small primal-dual gaps. We
make our code available at https://github.com/pawelswoboda/RAMA.</span>

                    <span>Super-resolving the Magnetic Resonance (MR) image of a target contrast under
the guidance of the corresponding auxiliary contrast, which provides additional
anatomical information, is a new and effective solution for fast MR imaging.
However, current multi-contrast super-resolution (SR) methods tend to
concatenate different contrasts directly, ignoring their relationships in
different clues, \eg, in the foreground and background. In this paper, we
propose a separable attention network (comprising a foreground priority
attention and background separation attention), named SANet. Our method can
explore the foreground and background areas in the forward and reverse
directions with the help of the auxiliary contrast, enabling it to learn
clearer anatomical structures and edge information for the SR of a
target-contrast MR image. SANet provides three appealing benefits: (1) It is
the first model to explore a separable attention mechanism that uses the
auxiliary contrast to predict the foreground and background regions, diverting
more attention to refining any uncertain details between these regions and
correcting the fine areas in the reconstructed results. (2) A multi-stage
integration module is proposed to learn the response of multi-contrast fusion
at different stages, obtain the dependency between the fused features, and
improve their representation ability. (3) Extensive experiments with various
state-of-the-art multi-contrast SR methods on fastMRI and clinical \textit{in
vivo} datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model.</span>

more significant than model architectures for visual recognition. This short
note studies effective training and scaling strategies for video recognition
models. We propose a simple scaling strategy for 3D ResNets, in combination
with improved training strategies and minor architectural changes. The
resulting models, termed 3D ResNet-RS, attain competitive performance of 81.0
on Kinetics-400 and 83.8 on Kinetics-600 without pre-training. When pre-trained
on a large Web Video Text dataset, our best model achieves 83.5 and 84.3 on

                    <span>Owing to human labor shortages, the automation of labor-intensive manual
waste-sorting is needed. The goal of automating waste-sorting is to replace the
human role of robust detection and agile manipulation of waste items with
robots. To achieve this, we propose three methods. First, we provide a combined
manipulation method using graspless push-and-drop and pick-and-release
manipulation. Second, we provide a robotic system that can automatically
collect object images to quickly train a deep neural-network model. Third, we
provide a method to mitigate the differences in the appearance of target
objects from two scenes: one for dataset collection and the other for waste
sorting in a recycling factory. If differences exist, the performance of a
trained waste detector may decrease. We address differences in illumination and
background by applying object scaling, histogram matching with histogram
equalization, and background synthesis to the source target-object images. Via
experiments in an indoor experimental workplace for waste-sorting, we confirm
that the proposed methods enable quick collection of the training image sets
for three classes of waste items (i.e., aluminum can, glass bottle, and plastic
bottle) and detection with higher performance than the methods that do not
consider the differences. We also confirm that the proposed method enables the
robot quickly manipulate the objects.</span>

                    <span>This paper explores the potential for performing temporal semantic
segmentation in the context of agricultural robotics without temporally
labelled data. We achieve this by proposing to generate virtual temporal
samples from labelled still images. By exploiting the relatively static scene
and assuming that the robot (camera) moves we are able to generate virtually
labelled temporal sequences with no extra annotation effort. Normally, to train
a recurrent neural network (RNN), labelled samples from a video (temporal)
sequence are required which is laborious and has stymied work in this
direction. By generating virtual temporal samples, we demonstrate that it is
possible to train a lightweight RNN to perform semantic segmentation on two
challenging agricultural datasets. Our results show that by training a temporal
semantic segmenter using virtual samples we can increase the performance by an
absolute amount of $4.6$ and $4.9$ on sweet pepper and sugar beet datasets,
respectively. This indicates that our virtual data augmentation technique is
able to accurately classify agricultural images temporally without the use of
complicated synthetic data generation techniques nor with the overhead of
labelling large amounts of temporal sequences.</span>

                    <span>Vision-and-language (V\&amp;L) reasoning necessitates perception of visual
concepts such as objects and actions, understanding semantics and language
grounding, and reasoning about the interplay between the two modalities. One
crucial aspect of visual reasoning is spatial understanding, which involves
understanding relative locations of objects, i.e.\ implicitly learning the
geometry of the scene. In this work, we evaluate the faithfulness of V\&amp;L
models to such geometric understanding, by formulating the prediction of
pair-wise relative locations of objects as a classification as well as a
regression task. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art transformer-based
V\&amp;L models lack sufficient abilities to excel at this task. Motivated by this,
we design two objectives as proxies for 3D spatial reasoning (SR) -- object
centroid estimation, and relative position estimation, and train V\&amp;L with weak
supervision from off-the-shelf depth estimators. This leads to considerable
improvements in accuracy for the &quot;GQA&quot; visual question answering challenge (in
fully supervised, few-shot, and O.O.D settings) as well as improvements in
relative spatial reasoning. Code and data will be released

                    <span>Capsule Networks (CapsNets) is a machine learning architecture proposed to
overcome some of the shortcomings of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
However, CapsNets have mainly outperformed CNNs in datasets where images are
small and/or the objects to identify have minimal background noise. In this
work, we present a new architecture, parallel CapsNets, which exploits the
concept of branching the network to isolate certain capsules, allowing each
branch to identify different entities. We applied our concept to the two
current types of CapsNet architectures, studying the performance for networks
with different layers of capsules. We tested our design in a public, highly
unbalanced dataset of acute myeloid leukaemia images (15 classes). Our
experiments showed that conventional CapsNets show similar performance than our
baseline CNN (ResNeXt-50) but depict instability problems. In contrast,
parallel CapsNets can outperform ResNeXt-50, is more stable, and shows better
rotational invariance than both, conventional CapsNets and ResNeXt-50.</span>

                    <span>Implicit neural rendering techniques have shown promising results for novel
view synthesis. However, existing methods usually encode the entire scene as a
whole, which is generally not aware of the object identity and limits the
ability to the high-level editing tasks such as moving or adding furniture. In
this paper, we present a novel neural scene rendering system, which learns an
object-compositional neural radiance field and produces realistic rendering
with editing capability for a clustered and real-world scene. Specifically, we
design a novel two-pathway architecture, in which the scene branch encodes the
scene geometry and appearance, and the object branch encodes each standalone
object conditioned on learnable object activation codes. To survive the
training in heavily cluttered scenes, we propose a scene-guided training
strategy to solve the 3D space ambiguity in the occluded regions and learn
sharp boundaries for each object. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
system not only achieves competitive performance for static scene novel-view
synthesis, but also produces realistic rendering for object-level editing.</span>

                    <span>To understand the black-box characteristics of deep networks, counterfactual
explanation that deduces not only the important features of an input space but
also how those features should be modified to classify input as a target class
has gained an increasing interest. The patterns that deep networks have learned
from a training dataset can be grasped by observing the feature variation among
various classes. However, current approaches perform the feature modification
to increase the classification probability for the target class irrespective of
the internal characteristics of deep networks. This often leads to unclear
explanations that deviate from real-world data distributions. To address this
problem, we propose a counterfactual explanation method that exploits the
statistics learned from a training dataset. Especially, we gradually construct
an explanation by iterating over masking and composition steps. The masking
step aims to select an important feature from the input data to be classified
as a target class. Meanwhile, the composition step aims to optimize the
previously selected feature by ensuring that its output score is close to the
logit space of the training data that are classified as the target class.
Experimental results show that our method produces human-friendly
interpretations on various classification datasets and verify that such
interpretations can be achieved with fewer feature modification.</span>

                    <span>Scene graph is a structured representation of a scene that can clearly
express the objects, attributes, and relationships between objects in the
scene. As computer vision technology continues to develop, people are no longer
satisfied with simply detecting and recognizing objects in images; instead,
people look forward to a higher level of understanding and reasoning about
visual scenes. For example, given an image, we want to not only detect and
recognize objects in the image, but also know the relationship between objects
(visual relationship detection), and generate a text description (image
captioning) based on the image content. Alternatively, we might want the
machine to tell us what the little girl in the image is doing (Visual Question
Answering (VQA)), or even remove the dog from the image and find similar images
(image editing and retrieval), etc. These tasks require a higher level of
understanding and reasoning for image vision tasks. The scene graph is just
such a powerful tool for scene understanding. Therefore, scene graphs have
attracted the attention of a large number of researchers, and related research
is often cross-modal, complex, and rapidly developing. However, no relatively
systematic survey of scene graphs exists at present. To this end, this survey
conducts a comprehensive investigation of the current scene graph research.
More specifically, we first summarized the general definition of the scene
graph, then conducted a comprehensive and systematic discussion on the
generation method of the scene graph (SGG) and the SGG with the aid of prior
knowledge. We then investigated the main applications of scene graphs and
summarized the most commonly used datasets. Finally, we provide some insights
into the future development of scene graphs. We believe this will be a very
helpful foundation for future research on scene graphs.</span>

up in the immediate future. GOHOME reaches 3$rd$ on Argoverse Motion

trained on. We conclude that manufacturers of advanced driver-assistance
systems (ADAS) must take special care to properly address small visual
differences between current and newly designed traffic sign pictograms, as well
as between pictograms from different countries.</span>

                    <span>Relation Extraction (RE) from tables is the task of identifying relations
between pairs of columns of a table. Generally, RE models for this task require
labelled tables for training. These labelled tables can also be generated
artificially from a Knowledge Graph (KG), which makes the cost to acquire them
much lower in comparison to manual annotations. However, unlike real tables,
these synthetic tables lack associated metadata, such as, column-headers,
captions, etc; this is because synthetic tables are created out of KGs that do
not store such metadata. Meanwhile, previous works have shown that metadata is
important for accurate RE from tables. To address this issue, we propose
methods to artificially create some of this metadata for synthetic tables.
Afterward, we experiment with a BERT-based model, in line with recently
published works, that takes as input a combination of proposed artificial
metadata and table content. Our empirical results show that this leads to an
improvement of 9\%-45\% in F1 score, in absolute terms, over 2 tabular
datasets.</span>

                    <span>Conversational recommender systems have attracted immense attention recently.
The most recent approaches rely on neural models trained on recorded dialogs
between humans, implementing an end-to-end learning process. These systems are
commonly designed to generate responses given the user&#x27;s utterances in natural
language. One main challenge is that these generated responses both have to be
appropriate for the given dialog context and must be grammatically and
semantically correct. An alternative to such generation-based approaches is to
retrieve responses from pre-recorded dialog data and to adapt them if needed.
Such retrieval-based approaches were successfully explored in the context of
general conversational systems, but have received limited attention in recent
years for CRS. In this work, we re-assess the potential of such approaches and
design and evaluate a novel technique for response retrieval and ranking. A
user study (N&#x3D;90) revealed that the responses by our system were on average of
higher quality than those of two recent generation-based systems. We
furthermore found that the quality ranking of the two generation-based
approaches is not aligned with the results from the literature, which points to
open methodological questions. Overall, our research underlines that
retrieval-based approaches should be considered an alternative or complement to
language generation approaches.</span>

                    <span>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on society, both because
of the serious health effects of COVID-19 and because of public health measures
implemented to slow its spread. Many of these difficulties are fundamentally
information needs; attempts to address these needs have caused an information
overload for both researchers and the public. Natural language processing
(NLP), the branch of artificial intelligence that interprets human language,
can be applied to address many of the information needs made urgent by the
COVID-19 pandemic. This review surveys approximately 150 NLP studies and more
than 50 systems and datasets addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We detail work
on four core NLP tasks: information retrieval, named entity recognition,
literature-based discovery, and question answering. We also describe work that
directly addresses aspects of the pandemic through four additional tasks: topic
modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, caseload forecasting, and
misinformation detection. We conclude by discussing observable trends and
remaining challenges.</span>

approaches have been proposed and applied by designers. This paper builds a
patent-based knowledge graph, patent-KG, to represent the knowledge facts in
patents for engineering design. The arising patent-KG approach proposes a new
unsupervised mechanism to extract the knowledge facts in patent, by searching
the attention graph in language models. This method avoids using expensive

rule-based extraction. The extracted entities are compared with other
benchmarks and shows a higher coverage of engineering words. The extracted

                    <span>Recommender systems research tends to evaluate model performance offline and
on randomly sampled targets, yet the same systems are later used to predict
user behavior sequentially from a fixed point in time. Simulating online
recommender system performance is notoriously difficult and the discrepancy
between online and offline behaviors is typically not accounted for in offline
evaluations. This disparity permits weaknesses to go unnoticed until the model
is deployed in a production setting. In this paper, we first demonstrate how
omitting temporal context when evaluating recommender system performance leads
to false confidence. To overcome this, we postulate that offline evaluation
protocols can only model real-life use-cases if they account for temporal
context. Next, we propose a training procedure to further embed the temporal
context in existing models. We use a multi-objective approach to introduce
temporal context into traditionally time-unaware recommender systems and
confirm its advantage via the proposed evaluation protocol. Finally, we
validate that the Pareto Fronts obtained with the added objective dominate
those produced by state-of-the-art models that are only optimized for accuracy
on three real-world publicly available datasets. The results show that
including our temporal objective can improve recall@20 by up to 20%.</span>

                    <span>Temporal set prediction is becoming increasingly important as many companies
employ recommender systems in their online businesses, e.g., personalized
purchase prediction of shopping baskets. While most previous techniques have
focused on leveraging a user&#x27;s history, the study of combining it with others&#x27;
histories remains untapped potential. This paper proposes Global-Local Item
Embedding (GLOIE) that learns to utilize the temporal properties of sets across
whole users as well as within a user by coining the names as global and local
information to distinguish the two temporal patterns. GLOIE uses Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) and dynamic graph-based model to capture global and local
information and then applies attention to integrate resulting item embeddings.
Additionally, we propose to use Tweedie output for the decoder of VAE as it can
easily model zero-inflated and long-tailed distribution, which is more suitable
for several real-world data distributions than Gaussian or multinomial
counterparts. When evaluated on three public benchmarks, our algorithm
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in most ranking
metrics.</span>

                    <span>Scenario-based question answering (SQA) requires retrieving and reading
paragraphs from a large corpus to answer a question which is contextualized by
a long scenario description. Since a scenario contains both keyphrases for
retrieval and much noise, retrieval for SQA is extremely difficult. Moreover,
it can hardly be supervised due to the lack of relevance labels of paragraphs
for SQA. To meet the challenge, in this paper we propose a joint
retriever-reader model called JEEVES where the retriever is implicitly
supervised only using QA labels via a novel word weighting mechanism. JEEVES
significantly outperforms a variety of strong baselines on multiple-choice
questions in three SQA datasets.</span>

                    <span>We study the problem of query attribute value extraction, which aims to
identify named entities from user queries as diverse surface form attribute
values and afterward transform them into formally canonical forms. Such a
problem consists of two phases: {named entity recognition (NER)} and {attribute
value normalization (AVN)}. However, existing works only focus on the NER phase
but neglect equally important AVN. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a
unified query attribute value extraction system in e-commerce search named
QUEACO, which involves both two phases. Moreover, by leveraging large-scale
weakly-labeled behavior data, we further improve the extraction performance
with less supervision cost. Specifically, for the NER phase, QUEACO adopts a
novel teacher-student network, where a teacher network that is trained on the
strongly-labeled data generates pseudo-labels to refine the weakly-labeled data
for training a student network. Meanwhile, the teacher network can be
dynamically adapted by the feedback of the student&#x27;s performance on
strongly-labeled data to maximally denoise the noisy supervisions from the weak
labels. For the AVN phase, we also leverage the weakly-labeled
query-to-attribute behavior data to normalize surface form attribute values
from queries into canonical forms from products. Extensive experiments on a
real-world large-scale E-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
QUEACO.</span>

interest in explainable artificial intelligence. In particular, post-hoc
approaches have proved to be the most easily applicable ones to increasingly
complex recommendation models, which are then treated as black-boxes. The most
recent literature has shown that for post-hoc explanations based on local
surrogate models, there are problems related to the robustness of the approach
itself. This consideration becomes even more relevant in human-related tasks
like recommendation. The explanation also has the arduous task of enhancing
increasingly relevant aspects of user experience such as transparency or
trustworthiness. This paper aims to show how the characteristics of a classical
post-hoc model based on surrogates is strongly model-dependent and does not

                    <span>Product quantization (PQ) is a widely used technique for ad-hoc retrieval.
Recent studies propose supervised PQ, where the embedding and quantization
models can be jointly trained with supervised learning. However, there is a
lack of appropriate formulation of the joint training objective; thus, the
improvements over previous non-supervised baselines are limited in reality. In
this work, we propose the Matching-oriented Product Quantization (MoPQ), where
a novel objective Multinoulli Contrastive Loss (MCL) is formulated. With the
minimization of MCL, we are able to maximize the matching probability of query
and ground-truth key, which contributes to the optimal retrieval accuracy.
Given that the exact computation of MCL is intractable due to the demand of
vast contrastive samples, we further propose the Differentiable Cross-device
Sampling (DCS), which significantly augments the contrastive samples for
precise approximation of MCL. We conduct extensive experimental studies on four
real-world datasets, whose results verify the effectiveness of MoPQ.</span>

                    <span>Most Fairness in AI research focuses on exposing biases in AI systems. A
broader lens on fairness reveals that AI can serve a greater aspiration:
rooting out societal inequities from their source. Specifically, we focus on
inequities in health information, and aim to reduce bias in that domain using
AI. The AI algorithms under the hood of search engines and social media, many
of which are based on recommender systems, have an outsized impact on the
quality of medical and health information online. Therefore, embedding bias
detection and reduction into these recommender systems serving up medical and
health content online could have an outsized positive impact on patient
outcomes and wellbeing.

In this position paper, we offer the following contributions: (1) we propose
a novel framework of Fairness via AI, inspired by insights from medical
education, sociology and antiracism; (2) we define a new term, bisinformation,
which is related to, but distinct from, misinformation, and encourage
researchers to study it; (3) we propose using AI to study, detect and mitigate
biased, harmful, and/or false health information that disproportionately hurts
minority groups in society; and (4) we suggest several pillars and pose several
open problems in order to seed inquiry in this new space. While part (3) of
this work specifically focuses on the health domain, the fundamental computer
science advances and contributions stemming from research efforts in bias
reduction and Fairness via AI have broad implications in all areas of society.</span>

                    <span>Question Answering (QA), a popular and promising technique for intelligent
information access, faces a dilemma about data as most other AI techniques. On
one hand, modern QA methods rely on deep learning models which are typically
data-hungry. Therefore, it is expected to collect and fuse all the available QA
datasets together in a common site for developing a powerful QA model. On the
other hand, real-world QA datasets are typically distributed in the form of
isolated islands belonging to different parties. Due to the increasing
awareness of privacy security, it is almost impossible to integrate the data
scattered around, or the cost is prohibited. A possible solution to this
dilemma is a new approach known as federated learning, which is a
privacy-preserving machine learning technique over distributed datasets. In
this work, we propose to adopt federated learning for QA with the special
concern on the statistical heterogeneity of the QA data. Here the heterogeneity
refers to the fact that annotated QA data are typically with non-identical and
independent distribution (non-IID) and unbalanced sizes in practice.
Traditional federated learning methods may sacrifice the accuracy of individual
models under the heterogeneous situation. To tackle this problem, we propose a
novel Federated Matching framework for QA, named FedMatch, with a
backbone-patch architecture. The shared backbone is to distill the common
knowledge of all the participants while the private patch is a compact and
efficient module to retain the domain information for each participant. To
facilitate the evaluation, we build a benchmark collection based on several QA
datasets from different domains to simulate the heterogeneous situation in
practice. Empirical studies demonstrate that our model can achieve significant
improvements against the baselines over all the datasets.</span>

                    <span>How data is represented and operationalized is critical for building
computational solutions that are both effective and efficient. A common
approach is to represent data objects as binary vectors, denoted \textit{hash
codes}, which require little storage and enable efficient similarity search
through direct indexing into a hash table or through similarity computations in
an appropriate space. Due to the limited expressibility of hash codes, compared
to real-valued representations, a core open challenge is how to generate hash
codes that well capture semantic content or latent properties using a small
number of bits, while ensuring that the hash codes are distributed in a way
that does not reduce their search efficiency. State of the art methods use
representation learning for generating such hash codes, focusing on neural
autoencoder architectures where semantics are encoded into the hash codes by
learning to reconstruct the original inputs of the hash codes. This thesis
addresses the above challenge and makes a number of contributions to
representation learning that (i) improve effectiveness of hash codes through
more expressive representations and a more effective similarity measure than
the current state of the art, namely the Hamming distance, and (ii) improve
efficiency of hash codes by learning representations that are especially suited
to the choice of search method. The contributions are empirically validated on
several tasks related to similarity search and recommendation.</span>

                    <span>To alleviate data sparsity and cold-start problems of traditional recommender
systems (RSs), incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs) to supplement auxiliary
information has attracted considerable attention recently. However, simply
integrating KGs in current KG-based RS models is not necessarily a guarantee to
improve the recommendation performance, which may even weaken the holistic
model capability. This is because the construction of these KGs is independent
of the collection of historical user-item interactions; hence, information in
these KGs may not always be helpful for recommendation to all users.

In this paper, we propose attentive Knowledge-aware Graph convolutional
networks with Collaborative Guidance for personalized Recommendation (CG-KGR).
CG-KGR is a novel knowledge-aware recommendation model that enables ample and
coherent learning of KGs and user-item interactions, via our proposed
Collaborative Guidance Mechanism. Specifically, CG-KGR first encapsulates
historical interactions to interactive information summarization. Then CG-KGR
utilizes it as guidance to extract information out of KGs, which eventually
provides more precise personalized recommendation. We conduct extensive
experiments on four real-world datasets over two recommendation tasks, i.e.,
Top-K recommendation and Click-Through rate (CTR) prediction. The experimental
results show that the CG-KGR model significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art models by 4.0-53.2% and 0.4-3.2%, in terms of Recall metric on
Top-K recommendation and AUC on CTR prediction, respectively.</span>

the author-topic model (ATM). We collect 16,855 scientific papers from six top
journals in the field of machine learning published from 1997 to 2016 and
analyze them using ATM. The dataset is broken down into 4 intervals to identify
the top researchers and find similar researchers using their similarity score.
The similarity score is calculated using Hellinger distance. The researchers
are plotted using t-SNE, which reduces the dimensionality of the data while
keeping the same distance between the points. The analysis of our study helps

                    <span>In this article, we propose a systematic approach for fire station location
planning. We develop a machine learning model, based on Random Forest, for
demand prediction and utilize the model further to define a generalized index
to measure quality of fire service in urban settings. Our model is built upon
spatial data collected from multiple different sources. Efficacy of proper
facility planning depends on choice of candidates where fire stations can be
located along with existing stations, if any. Also, the travel time from these
candidates to demand locations need to be taken care of to maintain fire safety
standard. Here, we propose a travel time based clustering technique to identify
suitable candidates. Finally, we develop an optimization problem to select best
locations to install new fire stations. Our optimization problem is built upon
maximum coverage problem, based on integer programming. We present a detailed
experimental study of our proposed approach in collaboration with city of
Victoria Fire Department, MN, USA. Our demand prediction model achieves true
positive rate of 70% and false positive rate of 22% approximately. We aid
Victoria Fire Department to select a location for a new fire station using our
approach. We present detailed results on improvement statistics by locating a
new facility, as suggested by our methodology, in the city of Victoria.</span>

                    <span>Maintaining the long-term exploration capability of the agent remains one of
the critical challenges in deep reinforcement learning. A representative
solution is to leverage reward shaping to provide intrinsic rewards for the
agent to encourage exploration. However, most existing methods suffer from
vanishing intrinsic rewards, which cannot provide sustainable exploration
incentives. Moreover, they rely heavily on complex models and additional memory
to record learning procedures, resulting in high computational complexity and
low robustness. To tackle this problem, entropy-based methods are proposed to
evaluate the global exploration performance, encouraging the agent to visit the
state space more equitably. However, the sample complexity of estimating the
state visitation entropy is prohibitive when handling environments with
high-dimensional observations. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric
entitled Jain&#x27;s fairness index (JFI) to replace the entropy regularizer, which
solves the exploration problem from a brand new perspective. In sharp contrast
to the entropy regularizer, JFI is more computable and robust and can be easily
applied generalized into arbitrary tasks. Furthermore, we leverage a
variational auto-encoder (VAE) model to capture the life-long novelty of
states, which is combined with the global JFI score to form multimodal
intrinsic rewards. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that our
multimodal reward shaping (MMRS) method can achieve higher performance than
other benchmark schemes.</span>

                    <span>We introduce Neural Marching Cubes (NMC), a data-driven approach for
extracting a triangle mesh from a discretized implicit field. Classical MC is
defined by coarse tessellation templates isolated to individual cubes. While
more refined tessellations have been proposed, they all make heuristic
assumptions, such as trilinearity, when determining the vertex positions and
local mesh topologies in each cube. In principle, none of these approaches can
reconstruct geometric features that reveal coherence or dependencies between
nearby cubes (e.g., a sharp edge), as such information is unaccounted for,
resulting in poor estimates of the true underlying implicit field. To tackle
these challenges, we re-cast MC from a deep learning perspective, by designing
tessellation templates more apt at preserving geometric features, and learning
the vertex positions and mesh topologies from training meshes, to account for
contextual information from nearby cubes. We develop a compact per-cube
parameterization to represent the output triangle mesh, while being compatible
with neural processing, so that a simple 3D convolutional network can be
employed for the training. We show that all topological cases in each cube that
are applicable to our design can be easily derived using our representation,
and the resulting tessellations can also be obtained naturally and efficiently
by following a few design guidelines. In addition, our network learns local
features with limited receptive fields, hence it generalizes well to new shapes
and new datasets. We evaluate our neural MC approach by quantitative and
qualitative comparisons to all well-known MC variants. In particular, we
demonstrate the ability of our network to recover sharp features such as edges
and corners, a long-standing issue of MC and its variants. Our network also
reconstructs local mesh topologies more accurately than previous approaches.</span>

                    <span>Motivated by cutting-edge applications like cryo-electron microscopy
(cryo-EM), the Multi-Reference Alignment (MRA) model entails the learning of an
unknown signal from repeated measurements of its images under the latent action
of a group of isometries and additive noise of magnitude $\sigma$. Despite
significant interest, a clear picture for understanding rates of estimation in
this model has emerged only recently, particularly in the high-noise regime
$\sigma \gg 1$ that is highly relevant in applications. Recent investigations
have revealed a remarkable asymptotic sample complexity of order $\sigma^6$ for
certain signals whose Fourier transforms have full support, in stark contrast
to the traditional $\sigma^2$ that arise in regular models. Often prohibitively
large in practice, these results have prompted the investigation of variations
around the MRA model where better sample complexity may be achieved. In this
paper, we show that \emph{sparse} signals exhibit an intermediate $\sigma^4$
sample complexity even in the classical MRA model. Our results explore and
exploit connections of the MRA estimation problem with two classical topics in
applied mathematics: the \textit{beltway problem} from combinatorial
optimization, and \textit{uniform uncertainty principles} from harmonic
analysis.</span>

                    <span>Measuring the predictability and complexity of time series is an essential
tool in designing and controlling the nonlinear system. Different entropy
measures exist in the literature to analyze the predictability and complexity
of time series. However, the existed methods have some drawbacks related to a
strong dependence of entropy on the parameters of the methods, as well as on
the length and amplitude of the time series. To overcome these difficulties,
this study proposes a new method for estimating the entropy of a time series
using the LogNNet neural network model. The LogNNet reservoir matrix is filled
with the time series elements according to our algorithm. The network is
trained on MNIST-10 dataset and the classification accuracy is calculated. The
accuracy is considered as the entropy measure and denoted by NNetEn. The
novelty of entropy calculation is that the time series is involved in mixing
the input information in the reservoir. The greater complexity of the time
series leads to the better ability of the neural network to learn, and to the
higher classification accuracy and NNetEn values. The epochs number in the
training process of LogNNet is considered as the control parameter. We
introduce a new time series characteristic, called time series learning
inertia, that determines the learning rate of the neural network. The
robustness and efficiency of the method is verified on chaotic, periodic,
random, binary and constant time series. The comparison of NNetEn with other
methods of entropy estimation demonstrates that our method is more robust and
accurate and can be widely used in practice.</span>

Management (PHM) of industrial asset is presented. This work provides an
overview of the general trend of XAI in PHM, answers the question of accuracy
versus explainability, the extent of human involvement, the explanation
assessment and uncertainty quantification in PHM-XAI domain. Research articles
associated with the subject, from 2015 to 2021 were selected from five known
databases following PRISMA guidelines. Data was then extracted from the
selected articles and examined. Several findings were synthesized. Firstly,
while the discipline is still young, the analysis indicated the growing
acceptance of XAI in PHM domain. Secondly, XAI functions as a double edge
sword, where it is assimilated as a tool to execute PHM tasks as well as a mean
of explanation, particularly in diagnostic and anomaly detection activities,
implying a real need for XAI in PHM. Thirdly, the review showed that PHM-XAI
papers produce either good or excellent result in general, suggesting that PHM
performance is unaffected by XAI. Fourthly, human role, evaluation metrics and
uncertainty management are areas requiring further attention by the PHM
community. Adequate assessment metrics to cater for PHM need are urgently
needed.Finally, most case study featured on the accepted articles are based on
real, industrial data, indicating that the available PHM-XAI blends are fit to
solve complex,real-world challenges, increasing the confidence in AI adoption

                    <span>This paper studies a class of constrained restless multi-armed bandits
(CRMAB). The constraints are in the form of time varying set of actions (set of
available arms). This variation can be either stochastic or semi-deterministic.
Given a set of arms, a fixed number of them can be chosen to be played in each
decision interval. The play of each arm yields a state dependent reward. The
current states of arms are partially observable through binary feedback signals
from arms that are played. The current availability of arms is fully
observable. The objective is to maximize long term cumulative reward. The
uncertainty about future availability of arms along with partial state
information makes this objective challenging. Applications for CRMAB can be
found in resource allocation in cyber-physical systems involving components
with time varying availability.

First, this optimization problem is analyzed using Whittle&#x27;s index policy. To
this end, a constrained restless single-armed bandit is studied. It is shown to
admit a threshold-type optimal policy and is also indexable. An algorithm to
compute Whittle&#x27;s index is presented. An alternate solution method with lower
complexity is also presented in the form of an online rollout policy. A
detailed discussion on the complexity of both these schemes is also presented,
which suggests that online rollout policy with short look ahead is simpler to
implement than Whittle&#x27;s index computation. Further, upper bounds on the value
function are derived in order to estimate the degree of sub-optimality of
various solutions. The simulation study compares the performance of Whittle&#x27;s
index, online rollout, myopic and modified Whittle&#x27;s index policies.</span>

importantly without any prior knowledge on the degree of non-stationarity. By
plugging different algorithms into our black-box, we provide a list of examples
showing that our approach not only recovers recent results for (contextual)
multi-armed bandits achieved by very specialized algorithms, but also
significantly improves the state of the art for (generalized) linear bandits,
episodic MDPs, and infinite-horizon MDPs in various ways. Specifically, in most
cases our algorithm achieves the optimal dynamic regret
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\min\{\sqrt{LT}, \Delta^{1/3}T^{2/3}\})$ where $T$ is
the number of rounds and $L$ and $\Delta$ are the number and amount of changes

                    <span>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change proposes different mitigation
strategies to achieve the net emissions reductions that would be required to
follow a pathway that limits global warming to 1.5{\deg}C with no or limited
overshoot. The transition towards a carbon-free society goes through an
inevitable increase in the share of renewable generation in the energy mix and
a drastic decrease in the total consumption of fossil fuels. Therefore, this
thesis studies the integration of renewables in power systems by investigating
forecasting and decision-making tools. Indeed, in contrast to conventional
power plants, renewable energy is subject to uncertainty. Most of the
generation technologies based on renewable sources are non-dispatchable, and
their production is stochastic and complex to predict in advance. A high share
of renewables is challenging for power systems that have been designed and
sized for dispatchable units. In this context, probabilistic forecasts, which
aim at modeling the distribution of all possible future realizations, have
become a vital tool to equip decision-makers, hopefully leading to better
decisions in energy applications. This thesis focuses on two main research
questions: (1) How to produce reliable probabilistic renewable generation
forecasts, consumption, and electricity prices? (2) How to make decisions with
uncertainty using probabilistic forecasts? The thesis perimeter is the energy
management of &quot;small&quot; systems such as microgrids at a residential scale on a
day-ahead basis. It is divided into two main parts to propose directions to
address both research questions (1) a forecasting part; (2) a planning and
control part.</span>

local regions of pixels are clustered via edge detection methods, a more
general probabilistic mathematical framework is devised. Critical thresholds
are calculated that indicate strong correlation between randomly-generated,
high dimensional data points that have been projected into structures in a
partition of a bounded, $2$-dimensional area, of which, an image is a special
case. A neighbor concept for structures in the partition is defined and a
critical radius is uncovered. Measured from a central structure in localized
regions of the partition, the radius indicates strong, long and short range
correlation in the count of occupied structures. The size of a short interval

two methods for solving these problems in a fast and accurate way. Our
experiments show the advantages of the proposed methods compared to the
traditional and randomized singular value decomposition methods. The proposed
methods are appropriate for applications involving huge matrices where the
accuracy of the desired singular values and also all of their corresponding
singular vectors are essential. As a real application, we evaluate the
performance of our methods on the problem of Riemannian similarity learning
between two various image datasets of MNIST and USPS.</span>

                    <span>Techniques to reduce the energy burden of an industrial ecosystem often
require solving a multiobjective optimization problem. However, collecting
experimental data can often be either expensive or time-consuming. In such
cases, statistical methods can be helpful. This article proposes Pareto Front
(PF) and Pareto Set (PS) estimation methods using Bayesian Additive Regression
Trees (BART), which is a non-parametric model whose assumptions are typically
less restrictive than popular alternatives, such as Gaussian Processes (GPs).
These less restrictive assumptions allow BART to handle scenarios (e.g.
high-dimensional input spaces, nonsmooth responses, large datasets) that GPs
find difficult. The performance of our BART-based method is compared to a
GP-based method using analytic test functions, demonstrating convincing
advantages. Finally, our BART-based methodology is applied to a motivating
engineering problem. Supplementary materials, which include a theorem proof,
algorithms, and R code, for this article are available online.</span>

                    <span>Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR) are a method for performing
symbolic AI on top of real-valued vectors \cite{Plate1995} by associating each
vector with an abstract concept, and providing mathematical operations to
manipulate vectors as if they were classic symbolic objects. This method has
seen little use outside of older symbolic AI work and cognitive science. Our
goal is to revisit this approach to understand if it is viable for enabling a
hybrid neural-symbolic approach to learning as a differentiable component of a
deep learning architecture. HRRs today are not effective in a differentiable
solution due to numerical instability, a problem we solve by introducing a
projection step that forces the vectors to exist in a well behaved point in
space. In doing so we improve the concept retrieval efficacy of HRRs by over
$100\times$. Using multi-label classification we demonstrate how to leverage
the symbolic HRR properties to develop an output layer and loss function that
is able to learn effectively, and allows us to investigate some of the pros and
cons of an HRR neuro-symbolic learning approach.</span>

                    <span>Knowledge graphs represented as RDF datasets are integral to many machine
learning applications. RDF is supported by a rich ecosystem of data management
systems and tools, most notably RDF database systems that provide a SPARQL
query interface. Surprisingly, machine learning tools for knowledge graphs do
not use SPARQL, despite the obvious advantages of using a database system. This
is due to the mismatch between SPARQL and machine learning tools in terms of
data model and programming style. Machine learning tools work on data in
tabular format and process it using an imperative programming style, while
SPARQL is declarative and has as its basic operation matching graph patterns to
RDF triples. We posit that a good interface to knowledge graphs from a machine
learning software stack should use an imperative, navigational programming
paradigm based on graph traversal rather than the SPARQL query paradigm based
on graph patterns. In this paper, we present RDFFrames, a framework that
provides such an interface. RDFFrames provides an imperative Python API that
gets internally translated to SPARQL, and it is integrated with the PyData
machine learning software stack. RDFFrames enables the user to make a sequence
of Python calls to define the data to be extracted from a knowledge graph
stored in an RDF database system, and it translates these calls into a compact
SPQARL query, executes it on the database system, and returns the results in a
standard tabular format. Thus, RDFFrames is a useful tool for data preparation
that combines the usability of PyData with the flexibility and performance of
RDF database systems.</span>

                    <span>Dry eye disease (DED) has a prevalence of between 5 and 50\%, depending on
the diagnostic criteria used and population under study. However, it remains
one of the most underdiagnosed and undertreated conditions in ophthalmology.
Many tests used in the diagnosis of DED rely on an experienced observer for
image interpretation, which may be considered subjective and result in
variation in diagnosis. Since artificial intelligence (AI) systems are capable
of advanced problem solving, use of such techniques could lead to more
objective diagnosis. Although the term &#x60;AI&#x27; is commonly used, recent success in
its applications to medicine is mainly due to advancements in the sub-field of
machine learning, which has been used to automatically classify images and
predict medical outcomes. Powerful machine learning techniques have been
harnessed to understand nuances in patient data and medical images, aiming for
consistent diagnosis and stratification of disease severity. This is the first
literature review on the use of AI in DED. We provide a brief introduction to
AI, report its current use in DED research and its potential for application in
the clinic. Our review found that AI has been employed in a wide range of DED
clinical tests and research applications, primarily for interpretation of
interferometry, slit-lamp and meibography images. While initial results are
promising, much work is still needed on model development, clinical testing and
standardisation.</span>

                    <span>Masked language modeling (MLM), a self-supervised pretraining objective, is
widely used in natural language processing for learning text representations.
MLM trains a model to predict a random sample of input tokens that have been
replaced by a [MASK] placeholder in a multi-class setting over the entire
vocabulary. When pretraining, it is common to use alongside MLM other auxiliary
objectives on the token or sequence level to improve downstream performance
(e.g. next sentence prediction). However, no previous work so far has attempted
in examining whether other simpler linguistically intuitive or not objectives
can be used standalone as main pretraining objectives. In this paper, we
explore five simple pretraining objectives based on token-level classification
tasks as replacements of MLM. Empirical results on GLUE and SQuAD show that our
proposed methods achieve comparable or better performance to MLM using a
BERT-BASE architecture. We further validate our methods using smaller models,
showing that pretraining a model with 41% of the BERT-BASE&#x27;s parameters,
BERT-MEDIUM results in only a 1% drop in GLUE scores with our best objective.</span>

                    <span>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent distributed learning
paradigm. FL entails some pressing needs for developing novel parameter
estimation approaches with theoretical guarantees of convergence, which are
also communication efficient, differentially private and Byzantine resilient in
the heterogeneous data distribution settings. Quantization-based SGD solvers
have been widely adopted in FL and the recently proposed SIGNSGD with majority
vote shows a promising direction. However, no existing methods enjoy all the
aforementioned properties. In this paper, we propose an intuitively-simple yet
theoretically-sound method based on SIGNSGD to bridge the gap. We present
Stochastic-Sign SGD which utilizes novel stochastic-sign based gradient
compressors enabling the aforementioned properties in a unified framework. We
also present an error-feedback variant of the proposed Stochastic-Sign SGD
which further improves the learning performance in FL. We test the proposed
method with extensive experiments using deep neural networks on the MNIST
dataset and the CIFAR-10 dataset. The experimental results corroborate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.</span>

                    <span>This paper proposes a multi-label classification algorithm capable of
continual learning by applying an Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART)-based

computation. The ART-based clustering algorithm adaptively and continually
generates prototype nodes corresponding to given data, and the generated nodes
are used as classifiers. The label probability computation independently counts
the number of label appearances for each class and calculates the Bayesian
probabilities. Thus, the label probability computation can cope with an
increase in the number of labels. Experimental results with synthetic and
real-world multi-label datasets show that the proposed algorithm has
competitive classification performance to other well-known algorithms while
realizing continual learning.</span>

                    <span>We study the problem of query attribute value extraction, which aims to
identify named entities from user queries as diverse surface form attribute
values and afterward transform them into formally canonical forms. Such a
problem consists of two phases: {named entity recognition (NER)} and {attribute
value normalization (AVN)}. However, existing works only focus on the NER phase
but neglect equally important AVN. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a
unified query attribute value extraction system in e-commerce search named
QUEACO, which involves both two phases. Moreover, by leveraging large-scale
weakly-labeled behavior data, we further improve the extraction performance
with less supervision cost. Specifically, for the NER phase, QUEACO adopts a
novel teacher-student network, where a teacher network that is trained on the
strongly-labeled data generates pseudo-labels to refine the weakly-labeled data
for training a student network. Meanwhile, the teacher network can be
dynamically adapted by the feedback of the student&#x27;s performance on
strongly-labeled data to maximally denoise the noisy supervisions from the weak
labels. For the AVN phase, we also leverage the weakly-labeled
query-to-attribute behavior data to normalize surface form attribute values
from queries into canonical forms from products. Extensive experiments on a
real-world large-scale E-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
QUEACO.</span>

                    <span>A single unit (head) is the conventional input feature extractor in deep
learning architectures trained on multivariate time series signals. The
importance of the fixed-dimensional vector representation generated by the
single-head network has been demonstrated for industrial machinery condition
monitoring and predictive maintenance. However, processing heterogeneous sensor
signals with a single head may result in a model that cannot explicitly account
for the diversity in time-varying multivariate inputs. This work extends the
conventional single-head deep learning models to a more robust form by
developing context-specific heads to independently capture the inherent pattern
of each sensor reading in multivariate time series signals. Using the turbofan
aircraft engine benchmark dataset (CMAPSS), an extensive experiment is
performed to verify the effectiveness and benefits of multi-head fully
connected neurons, recurrent networks, convolution network, the
transformer-style stand-alone attention network, and their variants for
remaining useful life estimation. Moreover, the effect of different attention
mechanisms on the multi-head models is also evaluated. In addition, each
architecture&#x27;s relative advantage and computational overhead are analyzed.
Results show that utilizing the attention layer is task-sensitive and
model-dependent, as it does not provide consistent improvement across the
models investigated. The result is further compared with five state-of-the-art
models, and the comparison shows that a relatively simple multi-head
architecture performs better than the state-of-the-art models. The results
presented in this study demonstrate the importance of multi-head models and
attention mechanisms to improved understanding of the remaining useful life of
industrial assets.</span>

                    <span>Sleep stage classification is essential for sleep assessment and disease
diagnosis. Although previous attempts to classify sleep stages have achieved
high classification performance, several challenges remain open: 1) How to
effectively utilize time-varying spatial and temporal features from
multi-channel brain signals remains challenging. Prior works have not been able
to fully utilize the spatial topological information among brain regions. 2)
Due to the many differences found in individual biological signals, how to
overcome the differences of subjects and improve the generalization of deep
neural networks is important. 3) Most deep learning methods ignore the
interpretability of the model to the brain. To address the above challenges, we
propose a multi-view spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks (MSTGCN)
with domain generalization for sleep stage classification. Specifically, we
construct two brain view graphs for MSTGCN based on the functional connectivity
and physical distance proximity of the brain regions. The MSTGCN consists of
graph convolutions for extracting spatial features and temporal convolutions
for capturing the transition rules among sleep stages. In addition, attention
mechanism is employed for capturing the most relevant spatial-temporal
information for sleep stage classification. Finally, domain generalization and
MSTGCN are integrated into a unified framework to extract subject-invariant
sleep features. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that the
proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</span>

distributed fog nodes at the edge of the Internet, enabling compute-intensive
and latency-sensitive computing services for vehicles through task offloading.
However, a heterogeneous mobility environment introduces uncertainties in terms
of resource supply and demand, which are inevitable bottlenecks for the optimal
offloading decision. Also, these uncertainties bring extra challenges to task
offloading under the oblivious adversary attack and data privacy risks. In this
article, we develop a new adversarial online learning algorithm with bandit
feedback based on the adversarial multi-armed bandit theory, to enable scalable
and low-complexity offloading decision making. Specifically, we focus on
optimizing fog node selection with the aim of minimizing the offloading service
costs in terms of delay and energy. The key is to implicitly tune the
exploration bonus in the selection process and the assessment rules of the
designed algorithm, taking into account volatile resource supply and demand. We
theoretically prove that the input-size dependent selection rule allows to
choose a suitable fog node without exploring the sub-optimal actions, and also
an appropriate score patching rule allows to quickly adapt to evolving
circumstances, which reduce variance and bias simultaneously, thereby achieving
a better exploitation-exploration balance. Simulation results verify the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm.</span>

                    <span>Recent advances on Out-of-Distribution (OoD) generalization reveal the
robustness of deep learning models against distribution shifts. However,
existing works focus on OoD algorithms, such as invariant risk minimization,
domain generalization, or stable learning, without considering the influence of
deep model architectures on OoD generalization, which may lead to sub-optimal
performance. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods search for architecture
based on its performance on the training data, which may result in poor
generalization for OoD tasks. In this work, we propose robust Neural
Architecture Search for OoD generalization (NAS-OoD), which optimizes the
architecture with respect to its performance on generated OoD data by gradient
descent. Specifically, a data generator is learned to synthesize OoD data by
maximizing losses computed by different neural architectures, while the goal
for architecture search is to find the optimal architecture parameters that
minimize the synthetic OoD data losses. The data generator and the neural
architecture are jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner, and the minimax
training process effectively discovers robust architectures that generalize
well for different distribution shifts. Extensive experimental results show
that NAS-OoD achieves superior performance on various OoD generalization
benchmarks with deep models having a much fewer number of parameters. In
addition, on a real industry dataset, the proposed NAS-OoD method reduces the
error rate by more than 70% compared with the state-of-the-art method,
demonstrating the proposed method&#x27;s practicality for real applications.</span>

                    <span>In order to extract knowledge from the large data collected by edge devices,
traditional cloud based approach that requires data upload may not be feasible
due to communication bandwidth limitation as well as privacy and security
concerns of end users. To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving
edge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.
Specifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device
individually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge
server for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the
communications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to
federated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework
does not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder
can be trained independently at each edge device without any server
involvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users&#x27; data is protected by
transmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption. Experimental
results provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various
design parameters such as the data compression ratio of the autoencoder and the
model complexity.</span>

                    <span>Over the recent years, Federated machine learning continues to gain interest
and momentum where there is a need to draw insights from data while preserving
the data provider&#x27;s privacy. However, one among other existing challenges in
the adoption of federated learning has been the lack of fair, transparent and
universally agreed incentivization schemes for rewarding the federated learning
contributors. Smart contracts on a blockchain network provide transparent,
immutable and independently verifiable proofs by all participants of the
network. We leverage this open and transparent nature of smart contracts on a
blockchain to define incentivization rules for the contributors, which is based
on a novel scalar quantity - federated contribution. Such a smart contract
based reward-driven model has the potential to revolutionize the federated
learning adoption in enterprises. Our contribution is two-fold: first is to
show how smart contract based blockchain can be a very natural communication
channel for federated learning. Second, leveraging this infrastructure, we can
show how an intuitive measure of each agents&#x27; contribution can be built and
integrated with the life cycle of the training and reward process.</span>

                    <span>Multi-view representation learning captures comprehensive information from
multiple views of a shared context. Recent works intuitively apply contrastive
learning (CL) to learn representations, regarded as a pairwise manner, which is
still scalable: view-specific noise is not filtered in learning view-shared
representations; the fake negative pairs, where the negative terms are actually
within the same class as the positive, and the real negative pairs are
coequally treated; and evenly measuring the similarities between terms might
interfere with optimization. Importantly, few works research the theoretical
framework of generalized self-supervised multi-view learning, especially for
more than two views. To this end, we rethink the existing multi-view learning
paradigm from the information theoretical perspective and then propose a novel
information theoretical framework for generalized multi-view learning. Guided
by it, we build a multi-view coding method with a three-tier progressive
architecture, namely Information theory-guided heuristic Progressive Multi-view
Coding (IPMC). In the distribution-tier, IPMC aligns the distribution between
views to reduce view-specific noise. In the set-tier, IPMC builds self-adjusted
pools for contrasting, which utilizes a view filter to adaptively modify the
pools. Lastly, in the instance-tier, we adopt a designed unified loss to learn
discriminative representations and reduce the gradient interference.
Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate the superiority of IPMC over
state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>Multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is an emerging optical imaging
method providing multiplex molecular and functional information from the rodent
brain. It can be greatly augmented by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that
offers excellent soft-tissue contrast and high-resolution brain anatomy.
Nevertheless, registration of multi-modal images remains challenging, chiefly
due to the entirely different image contrast rendered by these modalities.
Previously reported registration algorithms mostly relied on manual
user-dependent brain segmentation, which compromised data interpretation and
accurate quantification. Here we propose a fully automated registration method
for MSOT-MRI multimodal imaging empowered by deep learning. The automated
workflow includes neural network-based image segmentation to generate suitable
masks, which are subsequently registered using an additional neural network.
Performance of the algorithm is showcased with datasets acquired by
cross-sectional MSOT and high-field MRI preclinical scanners. The automated
registration method is further validated with manual and half-automated
registration, demonstrating its robustness and accuracy.</span>

                    <span>There has been much recent work using machine learning to answer causal
queries. Most focus on interventional queries, such as the conditional average
treatment effect. However, as noted by Pearl, interventional queries only form
part of a larger hierarchy of causal queries, with counterfactuals sitting at
the top. Despite this, our community has not fully succeeded in adapting
machine learning tools to answer counterfactual queries. This work addresses
this challenge by showing how to implement twin network counterfactual
inference -- an alternative to abduction, action, &amp; prediction counterfactual
inference -- with deep learning to estimate counterfactual queries. We show how
the graphical nature of twin networks makes them particularly amenable to deep
learning, yielding simple neural network architectures that, when trained, are
capable of counterfactual inference. Importantly, we show how to enforce known
identifiability constraints during training, ensuring the answer to each
counterfactual query is uniquely determined. We demonstrate our approach by
using it to accurately estimate the probabilities of causation -- important
counterfactual queries that quantify the degree to which one event was a
necessary or sufficient cause of another -- on both synthetic and real data.</span>

                    <span>Differentiable programming has recently received much interest as a paradigm
that facilitates taking gradients of computer programs. While the corresponding
flexible gradient-based optimization approaches so far have been used
predominantly for deep learning or enriching the latter with modeling
components, we want to demonstrate that they can also be useful for statistical
modeling per se, e.g., for quick prototyping when classical maximum likelihood
approaches are challenging or not feasible. In an application from a COVID-19
setting, we utilize differentiable programming to quickly build and optimize a
flexible prediction model adapted to the data quality challenges at hand.
Specifically, we develop a regression model, inspired by delay differential
equations, that can bridge temporal gaps of observations in the central German
registry of COVID-19 intensive care cases for predicting future demand. With
this exemplary modeling challenge, we illustrate how differentiable programming
can enable simple gradient-based optimization of the model by automatic
differentiation. This allowed us to quickly prototype a model under time
pressure that outperforms simpler benchmark models. We thus exemplify the
potential of differentiable programming also outside deep learning
applications, to provide more options for flexible applied statistical
modeling.</span>

                    <span>Motivation: Bacteriophages (aka phages), which mainly infect bacteria, play
key roles in the biology of microbes. As the most abundant biological entities
on the planet, the number of discovered phages is only the tip of the iceberg.
Recently, many new phages have been revealed using high throughput sequencing,
particularly metagenomic sequencing. Compared to the fast accumulation of
phage-like sequences, there is a serious lag in taxonomic classification of
phages. High diversity, abundance, and limited known phages pose great
challenges for taxonomic analysis. In particular, alignment-based tools have
difficulty in classifying fast accumulating contigs assembled from metagenomic
data. Results: In this work, we present a novel semi-supervised learning model,
named PhaGCN, to conduct taxonomic classification for phage contigs. In this
learning model, we construct a knowledge graph by combining the DNA sequence
features learned by convolutional neural network (CNN) and protein sequence
similarity gained from gene-sharing network. Then we apply graph convolutional
network (GCN) to utilize both the labeled and unlabeled samples in training to
enhance the learning ability. We tested PhaGCN on both simulated and real
sequencing data. The results clearly show that our method competes favorably
against available phage classification tools.</span>

                    <span>Quantum classifiers provide sophisticated embeddings of input data in Hilbert
space promising quantum advantage. The advantage stems from quantum feature
maps encoding the inputs into quantum states with variational quantum circuits.
A recent work shows how to map discrete features with fewer quantum bits using
Quantum Random Access Coding (QRAC), an important primitive to encode binary
strings into quantum states. We propose a new method to embed discrete features
with trainable quantum circuits by combining QRAC and a recently proposed
strategy for training quantum feature map called quantum metric learning. We
show that the proposed trainable embedding requires not only as few qubits as
QRAC but also overcomes the limitations of QRAC to classify inputs whose
classes are based on hard Boolean functions. We numerically demonstrate its use
in variational quantum classifiers to achieve better performances in
classifying real-world datasets, and thus its possibility to leverage near-term
quantum computers for quantum machine learning.</span>

                    <span>Demand forecasting based on empirical data is a viable approach for
optimizing a supply chain. However, in this approach, a model constructed from
past data occasionally becomes outdated due to long-term changes in the
environment, in which case the model should be updated (i.e., retrained) using
the latest data. In this study, we examine the effects of updating models in a
supply chain using a minimal setting. We demonstrate that when each party in
the supply chain has its own forecasting model, uncoordinated model retraining
causes the bullwhip effect even if a very simple replenishment policy is
applied. Our results also indicate that sharing the forecasting model among the
parties involved significantly reduces the bullwhip effect.</span>

treatments for such chronic diseases account for a high healthcare cost.
However, research has shown that diabetes can be proactively managed and
prevented while lowering these healthcare costs. We have mined a sample of ten
million customers&#x27; 360-degree data representing the state of Texas, USA, with
attributes current as of late 2018. The sample received from a market research

                    <span>Large pre-trained models such as CLIP offer consistent accuracy across a
range of data distributions when performing zero-shot inference (i.e., without
fine-tuning on a specific dataset). Although existing fine-tuning approaches
substantially improve accuracy in-distribution, they also reduce
out-of-distribution robustness. We address this tension by introducing a simple
and effective method for improving robustness: ensembling the weights of the
zero-shot and fine-tuned models. Compared to standard fine-tuning, the
resulting weight-space ensembles provide large accuracy improvements
out-of-distribution, while matching or improving in-distribution accuracy. On
ImageNet and five derived distribution shifts, weight-space ensembles improve
out-of-distribution accuracy by 2 to 10 percentage points while increasing
in-distribution accuracy by nearly 1 percentage point relative to standard
fine-tuning. These improvements come at no additional computational cost during
fine-tuning or inference.</span>

                    <span>Optical neural networks (ONNs) have demonstrated record-breaking potential in
high-performance neuromorphic computing due to their ultra-high execution speed
and low energy consumption. However, current learning protocols fail to provide
scalable and efficient solutions to photonic circuit optimization in practical
applications. In this work, we propose a novel on-chip learning framework to
release the full potential of ONNs for power-efficient in situ training.
Instead of deploying implementation-costly back-propagation, we directly
optimize the device configurations with computation budgets and power
constraints. We are the first to model the ONN on-chip learning as a
resource-constrained stochastic noisy zeroth-order optimization problem, and
propose a novel mixed-training strategy with two-level sparsity and power-aware
dynamic pruning to offer a scalable on-chip training solution in practical ONN
deployment. Compared with previous methods, we are the first to optimize over
2,500 optical components on chip. We can achieve much better optimization
stability, 3.7x-7.6x higher efficiency, and save &gt;90% power under practical

                    <span>We study the problem of learning the structure of an optimal Bayesian network
when additional constraints are posed on the network or on its moralized graph.
More precisely, we consider the constraint that the network or its moralized
graph are close, in terms of vertex or edge deletions, to a sparse graph class
$\Pi$. For example, we show that learning an optimal network whose moralized
graph has vertex deletion distance at most $k$ from a graph with maximum degree
1 can be computed in polynomial time when $k$ is constant. This extends
previous work that gave an algorithm with such a running time for the vertex
deletion distance to edgeless graphs [Korhonen &amp; Parviainen, NIPS 2015]. We
then show that further extensions or improvements are presumably impossible.
For example, we show that learning optimal networks where the network or its
moralized graph have maximum degree $2$ or connected components of size at most
$c$, $c\ge 3$, is NP-hard. Finally, we show that learning an optimal network
with at most $k$ edges in the moralized graph presumably has no $f(k)\cdot
|I|^{O(1)}$-time algorithm and that, in contrast, an optimal network with at
most $k$ arcs can be computed in $2^{O(k)}\cdot |I|^{O(1)}$ time where $|I|$ is
the total input size.</span>

                    <span>The rapid emergence of high-dimensional data in various areas has brought new
challenges to current ensemble clustering research. To deal with the curse of
dimensionality, recently considerable efforts in ensemble clustering have been
made by means of different subspace-based techniques. However, besides the
emphasis on subspaces, rather limited attention has been paid to the potential
diversity in similarity/dissimilarity metrics. It remains a surprisingly open
problem in ensemble clustering how to create and aggregate a large population
of diversified metrics, and furthermore, how to jointly investigate the
multi-level diversity in the large populations of metrics, subspaces, and
clusters in a unified framework. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a
novel multidiversified ensemble clustering approach. In particular, we create a
large number of diversified metrics by randomizing a scaled exponential
similarity kernel, which are then coupled with random subspaces to form a large
set of metric-subspace pairs. Based on the similarity matrices derived from
these metric-subspace pairs, an ensemble of diversified base clusterings can
thereby be constructed. Further, an entropy-based criterion is utilized to
explore the cluster-wise diversity in ensembles, based on which three specific
ensemble clustering algorithms are presented by incorporating three types of
consensus functions. Extensive experiments are conducted on 30 high-dimensional
datasets, including 18 cancer gene expression datasets and 12 image/speech
datasets, which demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms over the
state-of-the-art. The source code is available at

                    <span>The problem of training with a small set of positive samples is known as
few-shot learning (FSL). It is widely known that traditional deep learning (DL)
algorithms usually show very good performance when trained with large datasets.
However, in many applications, it is not possible to obtain such a high number
of samples. In the image domain, typical FSL applications include those related
to face recognition. In the audio domain, music fraud or speaker recognition
can be clearly benefited from FSL methods. This paper deals with the
application of FSL to the detection of specific and intentional acoustic events
given by different types of sound alarms, such as door bells or fire alarms,
using a limited number of samples. These sounds typically occur in domestic
environments where many events corresponding to a wide variety of sound classes
take place. Therefore, the detection of such alarms in a practical scenario can
be considered an open-set recognition (OSR) problem. To address the lack of a
dedicated public dataset for audio FSL, researchers usually make modifications
on other available datasets. This paper is aimed at poviding the audio
recognition community with a carefully annotated dataset
(https://zenodo.org/record/3689288) for FSL in an OSR context comprised of 1360
clips from 34 classes divided into pattern sounds} and unwanted sounds. To
facilitate and promote research on this area, results with state-of-the-art
baseline systems based on transfer learning are also presented.</span>

                    <span>Phishing attacks are among emerging security issues that recently draws
significant attention in the cyber security community. There are numerous
existing approaches for phishing URL detection. However, malicious URL
detection is still a research hotspot because attackers can bypass newly
introduced detection mechanisms by changing their tactics. This paper will
introduce a transformer-based malicious URL detection model, which has
significant accuracy and outperforms current detection methods. We conduct
experiments and compare them with six existing classical detection models.
Experiments demonstrate that our transformer-based model is the best performing
model from all perspectives among the seven models and achieves 97.3 % of
detection accuracy.</span>

                    <span>The present study investigates the accurate inference of Reynolds-averaged
Navier-Stokes solutions for the compressible flow over aerofoils in two
dimensions with a deep neural network. Our approach yields networks that learn
to generate precise flow fields for varying body-fitted, structured grids by
providing them with an encoding of the corresponding mapping to a canonical
space for the solutions. We apply the deep neural network model to a benchmark
case of incompressible flow at randomly given angles of attack and Reynolds
numbers and achieve an improvement of more than an order of magnitude compared
to previous work. Further, for transonic flow cases, the deep neural network
model accurately predicts complex flow behaviour at high Reynolds numbers, such
as shock wave/boundary layer interaction, and quantitative distributions like
pressure coefficient, skin friction coefficient as well as wake total pressure
profiles downstream of aerofoils. The proposed deep learning method
significantly speeds up the predictions of flow fields and shows promise for
enabling fast aerodynamic designs.</span>

information needed on a multi-agent learning system inspired by Event Triggered
Control (ETC) techniques. We consider a baseline scenario of a distributed
Q-learning problem on a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Following an event-based
approach, N agents explore the MDP and communicate experiences to a central
learner only when necessary, which performs updates of the actor Q functions.
We analyse the convergence guarantees retained with respect to a regular
Q-learning algorithm, and present experimental results showing that event-based
communication results in a substantial reduction of data transmission rates in
such distributed systems. Additionally, we discuss what effects (desired and
undesired) these event-based approaches have on the learning processes studied,

                    <span>Weighting methods are a common tool to de-bias estimates of causal effects.
And though there are an increasing number of seemingly disparate methods, many
of them can be folded into one unifying regime: causal optimal transport. This
new method directly targets distributional balance by minimizing optimal
transport distances between treatment and control groups or, more generally,
between a source and target population. Our approach is model-free but can also
incorporate moments or any other important functions of covariates that the
researcher desires to balance. We find that the causal optimal transport
outperforms competitor methods when both the propensity score and outcome
models are misspecified, indicating it is a robust alternative to common
weighting methods. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our method in an
external control study examining the effect of misoprostol versus oxytocin for
treatment of post-partum hemorrhage.</span>

different precisions and piecewise polynomial test functions of different
degrees affect the convergence rate of Variational Physics Informed Neural
Networks (VPINN) with respect to mesh refinement, while solving elliptic
boundary-value problems. Using a Petrov-Galerkin framework relying on an
inf-sup condition, we derive an a priori error estimate in the energy norm
between the exact solution and a suitable high-order piecewise interpolant of a
computed neural network. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical
predictions, and also indicate that the error decay follows the same behavior
when the neural network is not interpolated. Our results suggest, somehow
counterintuitively, that for smooth solutions the best strategy to achieve a

Learning (FL) under data heterogeneity. Most of the approaches proposed for
fair classification require diverse data that represent the different
demographic groups involved. In contrast, it is common for each client to own
data that represents only a single demographic group. Hence the existing
approaches cannot be adopted for fair classification models at the client
level. To resolve this challenge, we propose several aggregation techniques. We
empirically validate these techniques by comparing the resulting fairness
metrics and accuracy on CelebA, UTK, and FairFace datasets.</span>

                    <span>Anomaly detection on time series is a fundamental task in monitoring the Key
Performance Indicators (KPIs) of IT systems. Many of the existing approaches in
the literature show good performance while requiring a lot of training
resources. In this paper, the online matrix profile, which requires no
training, is proposed to address this issue. The anomalies are detected by
referring to the past subsequence that is the closest to the current one. The
distance significance is introduced based on the online matrix profile, which
demonstrates a prominent pattern when an anomaly occurs. Another training-free
approach spectral residual is integrated into our approach to further enhance
the detection accuracy. Moreover, the proposed approach is sped up by at least
four times for long time series by the introduced cache strategy. In comparison
to the existing approaches, the online matrix profile makes a good trade-off
between accuracy and efficiency. More importantly, it is generic to various
types of time series in the sense that it works without the constraint from any
trained model.</span>

                    <span>Designing optimal reward functions has been desired but extremely difficult
in reinforcement learning (RL). When it comes to modern complex tasks,
sophisticated reward functions are widely used to simplify policy learning yet
even a tiny adjustment on them is expensive to evaluate due to the drastically
increasing cost of training. To this end, we propose a hindsight reward
tweaking approach by designing a novel paradigm for deep reinforcement learning
to model the influences of reward functions within a near-optimal space. We
simply extend the input observation with a condition vector linearly correlated
with the effective environment reward parameters and train the model in a
conventional manner except for randomizing reward configurations, obtaining a
hyper-policy whose characteristics are sensitively regulated over the condition
space. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and study one of its
potential application in policy performance boosting with multiple MuJoCo
tasks.</span>

                    <span>Recommender systems research tends to evaluate model performance offline and
on randomly sampled targets, yet the same systems are later used to predict
user behavior sequentially from a fixed point in time. Simulating online
recommender system performance is notoriously difficult and the discrepancy
between online and offline behaviors is typically not accounted for in offline
evaluations. This disparity permits weaknesses to go unnoticed until the model
is deployed in a production setting. In this paper, we first demonstrate how
omitting temporal context when evaluating recommender system performance leads
to false confidence. To overcome this, we postulate that offline evaluation
protocols can only model real-life use-cases if they account for temporal
context. Next, we propose a training procedure to further embed the temporal
context in existing models. We use a multi-objective approach to introduce
temporal context into traditionally time-unaware recommender systems and
confirm its advantage via the proposed evaluation protocol. Finally, we
validate that the Pareto Fronts obtained with the added objective dominate
those produced by state-of-the-art models that are only optimized for accuracy
on three real-world publicly available datasets. The results show that
including our temporal objective can improve recall@20 by up to 20%.</span>

                    <span>Segmentation plays a crucial role in diagnosis. Studying the retinal
vasculatures from fundus images help identify early signs of many crucial
illnesses such as diabetic retinopathy. Due to the varying shape, size, and
patterns of retinal vessels, along with artefacts and noises in fundus images,
no one-stage method can accurately segment retinal vessels. In this work, we
propose a multi-scale, multi-level attention embedded CNN architecture
((M)SLAe-Net) to address the issue of multi-stage processing for robust and
precise segmentation of retinal vessels. We do this by extracting features at
multiple scales and multiple levels of the network, enabling our model to
holistically extracts the local and global features. Multi-scale features are
extracted using our novel dynamic dilated pyramid pooling (D-DPP) module. We
also aggregate the features from all the network levels. These effectively
resolved the issues of varying shapes and artefacts and hence the need for
multiple stages. To assist in better pixel-level classification, we use the
Squeeze and Attention(SA) module, a smartly adapted version of the Squeeze and
Excitation(SE) module for segmentation tasks in our network to facilitate
pixel-group attention. Our unique network design and novel D-DPP module with
efficient task-specific loss function for thin vessels enabled our model for
better cross data performance. Exhaustive experimental results on DRIVE, STARE,
HRF, and CHASE-DB1 show the superiority of our method.</span>

                    <span>Most Fairness in AI research focuses on exposing biases in AI systems. A
broader lens on fairness reveals that AI can serve a greater aspiration:
rooting out societal inequities from their source. Specifically, we focus on
inequities in health information, and aim to reduce bias in that domain using
AI. The AI algorithms under the hood of search engines and social media, many
of which are based on recommender systems, have an outsized impact on the
quality of medical and health information online. Therefore, embedding bias
detection and reduction into these recommender systems serving up medical and
health content online could have an outsized positive impact on patient
outcomes and wellbeing.

In this position paper, we offer the following contributions: (1) we propose
a novel framework of Fairness via AI, inspired by insights from medical
education, sociology and antiracism; (2) we define a new term, bisinformation,
which is related to, but distinct from, misinformation, and encourage
researchers to study it; (3) we propose using AI to study, detect and mitigate
biased, harmful, and/or false health information that disproportionately hurts
minority groups in society; and (4) we suggest several pillars and pose several
open problems in order to seed inquiry in this new space. While part (3) of
this work specifically focuses on the health domain, the fundamental computer
science advances and contributions stemming from research efforts in bias
reduction and Fairness via AI have broad implications in all areas of society.</span>

promote peaceful, non-polarized discourse. However, there is a lack of
large-scale longitudinal studies of its effectiveness for reducing hate speech.
To this end, we perform an exploratory analysis of the effectiveness of counter
speech using several different macro- and micro-level measures to analyze
180,000 political conversations that took place on German Twitter over four
years. We report on the dynamic interactions of hate and counter speech over
time and provide insights into whether, as in &#x60;classic&#x27; bullying situations,
organized efforts are more effective than independent individuals in steering
online discourse. Taken together, our results build a multifaceted picture of
the dynamics of hate and counter speech online. While we make no causal claims
due to the complexity of discourse dynamics, our findings suggest that
organized hate speech is associated with changes in public discourse and that
counter speech -- especially when organized -- may help curb hateful rhetoric
in online discourse.</span>

                    <span>Stochastic linear bandits with high-dimensional sparse features are a
practical model for a variety of domains, including personalized medicine and
online advertising. We derive a novel $\Omega(n^{2/3})$ dimension-free minimax
regret lower bound for sparse linear bandits in the data-poor regime where the
horizon is smaller than the ambient dimension and where the feature vectors
admit a well-conditioned exploration distribution. This is complemented by a
nearly matching upper bound for an explore-then-commit algorithm showing that
that $\Theta(n^{2/3})$ is the optimal rate in the data-poor regime. The results
complement existing bounds for the data-rich regime and provide another example
where carefully balancing the trade-off between information and regret is
necessary. Finally, we prove a dimension-free $O(\sqrt{n})$ regret upper bound
under an additional assumption on the magnitude of the signal for relevant
features.</span>

                    <span>We study nonparametric dependence detection with the proposed binary
expansion approximation of uniformity (BEAUTY) approach, which generalizes the
celebrated Euler&#x27;s formula, and approximates the characteristic function of any
copula with a linear combination of expectations of binary interactions from
marginal binary expansions. This novel theory enables a unification of many
important tests through approximations from some quadratic forms of symmetry
statistics, where the deterministic weight matrix characterizes the power
properties of each test. To achieve a robust power, we study test statistics
with data-adaptive weights, referred to as the binary expansion adaptive
symmetry test (BEAST). By utilizing the properties of the binary expansion
filtration, we show that the Neyman-Pearson test of uniformity can be
approximated by an oracle weighted sum of symmetry statistics. The BEAST with
this oracle provides a benchmark of feasible power against any alternative by
leading all existing tests with a substantial margin. To approach this oracle
power, we develop the BEAST through a regularized resampling approximation of
the oracle test. The BEAST improves the empirical power of many existing tests
against a wide spectrum of common alternatives while providing clear
interpretation of the form of dependency upon rejection.</span>

                    <span>Online mirror descent (OMD) and dual averaging (DA) -- two fundamental
algorithms for online convex optimization -- are known to have very similar
(and sometimes identical) performance guarantees when used with a fixed
learning rate. Under dynamic learning rates, however, OMD is provably inferior
to DA and suffers a linear regret, even in common settings such as prediction
with expert advice. We modify the OMD algorithm through a simple technique that
we call stabilization. We give essentially the same abstract regret bound for
OMD with stabilization and for DA by modifying the classical OMD convergence
analysis in a careful and modular way that allows for straightforward and
flexible proofs. Simple corollaries of these bounds show that OMD with
stabilization and DA enjoy the same performance guarantees in many applications
-- even under dynamic learning rates. We also shed light on the similarities
between OMD and DA and show simple conditions under which stabilized-OMD and DA
generate the same iterates.</span>

                    <span>Wildfire is one of the biggest disasters that frequently occurs on the west
coast of the United States. Many efforts have been made to understand the
causes of the increases in wildfire intensity and frequency in recent years. In
this work, we propose static and dynamic prediction models to analyze and
assess the areas with high wildfire risks in California by utilizing a
multitude of environmental data including population density, Normalized
Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), tree
mortality area, tree mortality number, and altitude. Moreover, we focus on a
better understanding of the impacts of different factors so as to inform
preventive actions. To validate our models and findings, we divide the land of
California into 4,242 grids of 0.1 degrees $\times$ 0.1 degrees in latitude and
longitude, and compute the risk of each grid based on spatial and temporal
conditions. To verify the generalizability of our models, we further expand the
scope of wildfire risk assessment from California to Washington without any
fine tuning. By performing counterfactual analysis, we uncover the effects of
several possible methods on reducing the number of high risk wildfires. Taken
together, our study has the potential to estimate, monitor, and reduce the
risks of wildfires across diverse areas provided that such environment data is
available.</span>

                    <span>In practice, and more especially when training deep neural networks, visual
recognition rules are often learned based on various sources of information. On
the other hand, the recent deployment of facial recognition systems with uneven
predictive performances on different population segments highlights the
representativeness issues possibly induced by a naive aggregation of image
datasets. Indeed, sampling bias does not vanish simply by considering larger
datasets, and ignoring its impact may completely jeopardize the generalization
capacity of the learned prediction rules. In this paper, we show how biasing
models, originally introduced for nonparametric estimation in (Gill et al.,
1988), and recently revisited from the perspective of statistical learning
theory in (Laforgue and Cl\&#x27;emen\c{c}on, 2019), can be applied to remedy these
problems in the context of visual recognition. Based on the (approximate)
knowledge of the biasing mechanisms at work, our approach consists in
reweighting the observations, so as to form a nearly debiased estimator of the
target distribution. One key condition for our method to be theoretically valid
is that the supports of the distributions generating the biased datasets at
disposal must overlap, and cover the support of the target distribution. In
order to meet this requirement in practice, we propose to use a low dimensional
image representation, shared across the image databases. Finally, we provide
numerical experiments highlighting the relevance of our approach whenever the
biasing functions are appropriately chosen.</span>

                    <span>Classification has been a major task for building intelligent systems as it
enables decision-making under uncertainty. Classifier design aims at building
models from training data for representing feature-label distributions--either
explicitly or implicitly. In many scientific or clinical settings, training
data are typically limited, which makes designing accurate classifiers and
evaluating their classification error extremely challenging. While transfer
learning (TL) can alleviate this issue by incorporating data from relevant
source domains to improve learning in a different target domain, it has
received little attention for performance assessment, notably in error
estimation. In this paper, we fill this gap by investigating knowledge
transferability in the context of classification error estimation within a
Bayesian paradigm. We introduce a novel class of Bayesian minimum mean-square
error (MMSE) estimators for optimal Bayesian transfer learning (OBTL), which
enables rigorous evaluation of classification error under uncertainty in a
small-sample setting. Using Monte Carlo importance sampling, we employ the
proposed estimator to evaluate the classification accuracy of a broad family of
classifiers that span diverse learning capabilities. Experimental results based
on both synthetic data as well as real-world RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data show
that our proposed OBTL error estimation scheme clearly outperforms standard
error estimators, especially in a small-sample setting, by tapping into the
data from other relevant domains.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks (DNN) have shown superior performance in a variety of
tasks. As they rapidly evolve, their escalating computation and memory demands
make it challenging to deploy them on resource-constrained edge devices. Though
extensive efficient accelerator designs, from traditional electronics to
emerging photonics, have been successfully demonstrated, they are still
bottlenecked by expensive memory accesses due to tremendous gaps between the
bandwidth/power/latency of electrical memory and computing cores. Previous
solutions fail to fully-leverage the ultra-fast computational speed of emerging
DNN accelerators to break through the critical memory bound. In this work, we
propose a general and unified framework to trade expensive memory transactions
with ultra-fast on-chip computations, directly translating to performance
improvement. We are the first to jointly explore the intrinsic correlations and
bit-level redundancy within DNN kernels and propose a multi-level in situ
generation mechanism with mixed-precision bases to achieve on-the-fly recovery
of high-resolution parameters with minimum hardware overhead. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our proposed joint method can boost the memory
efficiency by 10-20x with comparable accuracy over four state-of-the-art
designs, when benchmarked on ResNet-18/DenseNet-121/MobileNetV2/V3 with various

                    <span>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on numerous
applications. However, it is difficult to tell beforehand if a DNN receiving an
input will deliver the correct output since their decision criteria are usually
nontransparent. A DNN delivers the correct output if the input is within the
area enclosed by its generalization envelope. In this case, the information
contained in the input sample is processed reasonably by the network. It is of
large practical importance to assess at inference time if a DNN generalizes
correctly. Currently, the approaches to achieve this goal are investigated in
different problem set-ups rather independently from one another, leading to
three main research and literature fields: predictive uncertainty,
out-of-distribution detection and adversarial example detection. This survey
connects the three fields within the larger framework of investigating the
generalization performance of machine learning methods and in particular DNNs.
We underline the common ground, point at the most promising approaches and give
a structured overview of the methods that provide at inference time means to
establish if the current input is within the generalization envelope of a DNN.</span>

science, Data driven science (the so called fourth science paradigm) is going
to be the driving force in research and innovation. From medicine to
biodiversity and astronomy to geology, all these terms are somehow going to be
affected by this paradigm shift. The huge amount of data to be processed under
this new paradigm will be a major concern in the future and one will strongly
require cloud based services in all the aspects of these computations (from
storage to compute and other services). Another aspect will be energy
consumption and performance of prediction jobs and tasks within such a
scientific paradigm which will change the way one sees computation. Data
science has heavily impacted or rather triggered the emergence of Machine
Learning, Signal/Image/Video processing related algorithms, Artificial
intelligence, Robotics, health informatics, geoinformatics, and many more such
areas of interest. Hence, we envisage an era where Data science can deliver its
promises with the help of the existing cloud based platforms and services with
the addition of new services. In this article, we discuss about data driven
science and Machine learning and how they are going to be linked through cloud
based services in the future. It also discusses the rise of paradigms like
approximate computing, quantum computing and many more in recent times and
their applicability in big data processing, data science, analytics, prediction

                    <span>We consider adversarial attacks to a black-box model when no queries are
allowed. In this setting, many methods directly attack surrogate models and
transfer the obtained adversarial examples to fool the target model. Plenty of
previous works investigated what kind of attacks to the surrogate model can
generate more transferable adversarial examples, but their performances are
still limited due to the mismatches between surrogate models and the target
model. In this paper, we tackle this problem from a novel angle -- instead of
using the original surrogate models, can we obtain a Meta-Surrogate Model (MSM)
such that attacks to this model can be easier transferred to other models? We
show that this goal can be mathematically formulated as a well-posed
(bi-level-like) optimization problem and design a differentiable attacker to
make training feasible. Given one or a set of surrogate models, our method can
thus obtain an MSM such that adversarial examples generated on MSM enjoy
eximious transferability. Comprehensive experiments on Cifar-10 and ImageNet
demonstrate that by attacking the MSM, we can obtain stronger transferable
adversarial examples to fool black-box models including adversarially trained
ones, with much higher success rates than existing methods. The proposed method
reveals significant security challenges of deep models and is promising to be
served as a state-of-the-art benchmark for evaluating the robustness of deep
models in the black-box setting.</span>

                    <span>The recent achievements of Deep Learning rely on the test data being similar
in distribution to the training data. In an ideal case, Deep Learning models
would achieve Out-of-Distribution (OoD) Generalization, i.e. reliably make
predictions on out-of-distribution data. Yet in practice, models usually fail
to generalize well when facing a shift in distribution. Several methods were
thereby designed to improve the robustness of the features learned by a model
through Regularization- or Domain-Prediction-based schemes. Segmenting medical
images such as MRIs of the hippocampus is essential for the diagnosis and
treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. But these brain images often suffer
from distribution shift due to the patient&#x27;s age and various pathologies
affecting the shape of the organ. In this work, we evaluate OoD Generalization
solutions for the problem of hippocampus segmentation in MR data using both
fully- and semi-supervised training. We find that no method performs reliably
in all experiments. Only the V-REx loss stands out as it remains easy to tune,
while it outperforms a standard U-Net in most cases.</span>

                    <span>Graph Representation Learning (GRL) has become essential for modern graph
data mining and learning tasks. GRL aims to capture the graph&#x27;s structural
information and exploit it in combination with node and edge attributes to
compute low-dimensional representations. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
have been used in state-of-the-art GRL architectures, they have been shown to
suffer from over smoothing when many GNN layers need to be stacked. In a
different GRL approach, spectral methods based on graph filtering have emerged
addressing over smoothing; however, up to now, they employ traditional neural
networks that cannot efficiently exploit the structure of graph data. Motivated
by this, we propose PointSpectrum, a spectral method that incorporates a set
equivariant network to account for a graph&#x27;s structure. PointSpectrum enhances
the efficiency and expressiveness of spectral methods, while it outperforms or
competes with state-of-the-art GRL methods. Overall, PointSpectrum addresses
over smoothing by employing a graph filter and captures a graph&#x27;s structure
through set equivariance, lying on the intersection of GNNs and spectral
methods. Our findings are promising for the benefits and applicability of this
architectural shift for spectral methods and GRL.</span>

correlation clustering) problem, a classical graph clustering problem widely
used in machine learning and computer vision. Our algorithm consists of three
steps executed recursively: (1) Finding conflicted cycles that correspond to
violated inequalities of the underlying multicut relaxation, (2) Performing
message passing between the edges and cycles to optimize the Lagrange
relaxation coming from the found violated cycles producing reduced costs and
(3) Contracting edges with high reduced costs through matrix-matrix
multiplications.

Our algorithm produces primal solutions and dual lower bounds that estimate
the distance to optimum. We implement our algorithm on GPUs and show resulting

                    <span>Adversarial attacks attempt to disrupt the training, retraining and utilizing
of artificial intelligence and machine learning models in large-scale
distributed machine learning systems. This causes security risks on its
prediction outcome. For example, attackers attempt to poison the model by
either presenting inaccurate misrepresentative data or altering the models&#x27;
parameters. In addition, Byzantine faults including software, hardware, network
issues occur in distributed systems which also lead to a negative impact on the
prediction outcome. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed training
algorithm, partial synchronous stochastic gradient descent (ParSGD), which
defends adversarial attacks and/or tolerates Byzantine faults. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our algorithm under three common adversarial attacks again
the ML models and a Byzantine fault during the training phase. Our results show
that using ParSGD, ML models can still produce accurate predictions as if it is
not being attacked nor having failures at all when almost half of the nodes are
being compromised or failed. We will report the experimental evaluations of
ParSGD in comparison with other algorithms.</span>

                    <span>The COVID-19 pandemic raises the problem of adapting face recognition systems
to the new reality, where people may wear surgical masks to cover their noses
and mouths. Traditional data sets (e.g., CelebA, CASIA-WebFace) used for
training these systems were released before the pandemic, so they now seem
unsuited due to the lack of examples of people wearing masks. We propose a
method for enhancing data sets containing faces without masks by creating
synthetic masks and overlaying them on faces in the original images. Our method
relies on Spark AR Studio, a developer program made by Facebook that is used to
create Instagram face filters. In our approach, we use 9 masks of different
colors, shapes and fabrics. We employ our method to generate a number of
445,446 (90%) samples of masks for the CASIA-WebFace data set and 196,254
(96.8%) masks for the CelebA data set, releasing the mask images at
https://github.com/securifai/masked_faces. We show that our method produces
significantly more realistic training examples of masks overlaid on faces by
asking volunteers to qualitatively compare it to other methods or data sets
designed for the same task. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our method by
evaluating state-of-the-art face recognition systems (FaceNet, VGG-face,
ArcFace) trained on the enhanced data sets and showing that they outperform
equivalent systems trained on the original data sets (containing faces without
masks), when the test benchmark contains masked faces.</span>

                    <span>Knowledge transfer across several streaming processes remain challenging
problem not only because of different distributions of each stream but also
because of rapidly changing and never-ending environments of data streams.
Albeit growing research achievements in this area, most of existing works are
developed for a single source domain which limits its resilience to exploit
multi-source domains being beneficial to recover from concept drifts quickly
and to avoid the negative transfer problem. An online domain adaptation
technique under multisource streaming processes, namely automatic online
multi-source domain adaptation (AOMSDA), is proposed in this paper. The online
domain adaptation strategy of AOMSDA is formulated under a coupled generative
and discriminative approach of denoising autoencoder (DAE) where the central
moment discrepancy (CMD)-based regularizer is integrated to handle the
existence of multi-source domains thereby taking advantage of complementary
information sources. The asynchronous concept drifts taking place at different
time periods are addressed by a self-organizing structure and a node
re-weighting strategy. Our numerical study demonstrates that AOMSDA is capable
of outperforming its counterparts in 5 of 8 study cases while the ablation
study depicts the advantage of each learning component. In addition, AOMSDA is
general for any number of source streams. The source code of AOMSDA is shared
publicly in https://github.com/Renchunzi-Xie/AOMSDA.git.</span>

                    <span>The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most challenging healthcare crises during
the 21st century. As the virus continues to spread on a global scale, the
majority of efforts have been on the development of vaccines and the mass
immunization of the public. While the daily case numbers were following a
decreasing trend, the emergent of new virus mutations and variants still pose a
significant threat. As economies start recovering and societies start opening
up with people going back into office buildings, schools, and malls, we still
need to have the ability to detect and minimize the spread of COVID-19.
Individuals with COVID-19 may show multiple symptoms such as cough, fever, and
shortness of breath. Many of the existing detection techniques focus on
symptoms having the same equal importance. However, it has been shown that some
symptoms are more prevalent than others. In this paper, we present a multimodal
method to predict COVID-19 by incorporating existing deep learning classifiers
using convolutional neural networks and our novel probability-based weighting
function that considers the prevalence of each symptom. The experiments were
performed on an existing dataset with respect to the three considered modes of
coughs, fever, and shortness of breath. The results show considerable
improvements in the detection of COVID-19 using our weighting function when
compared to an equal weighting function.</span>

                    <span>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are one of the most widely used
generative models. GANs can learn complex multi-modal distributions, and
generate real-like samples. Despite the major success of GANs in generating
synthetic data, they might suffer from unstable training process, and mode
collapse. In this paper, we introduce a new GAN architecture called variance
enforcing GAN (VARGAN), which incorporates a third network to introduce
diversity in the generated samples. The third network measures the diversity of
the generated samples, which is used to penalize the generator&#x27;s loss for low
diversity samples. The network is trained on the available training data and
undesired distributions with limited modality. On a set of synthetic and
real-world image data, VARGAN generates a more diverse set of samples compared
to the recent state-of-the-art models. High diversity and low computational
complexity, as well as fast convergence, make VARGAN a promising model to
alleviate mode collapse.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural network pruning and quantization techniques have demonstrated it
is possible to achieve high levels of compression with surprisingly little
degradation to test set accuracy. However, this measure of performance conceals
significant differences in how different classes and images are impacted by
model compression techniques. We find that models with radically different
numbers of weights have comparable top-line performance metrics but diverge
considerably in behavior on a narrow subset of the dataset. This small subset
of data points, which we term Pruning Identified Exemplars (PIEs) are
systematically more impacted by the introduction of sparsity. Compression
disproportionately impacts model performance on the underrepresented long-tail
of the data distribution. PIEs over-index on atypical or noisy images that are
far more challenging for both humans and algorithms to classify. Our work
provides intuition into the role of capacity in deep neural networks and the
trade-offs incurred by compression. An understanding of this disparate impact
is critical given the widespread deployment of compressed models in the wild.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we construct neural networks with ReLU, sine and $2^x$ as
activation functions. For general continuous $f$ defined on $[0,1]^d$ with
continuity modulus $\omega_f(\cdot)$, we construct ReLU-sine-$2^x$ networks
that enjoy an approximation rate
$\mathcal{O}(\omega_f(\sqrt{d})\cdot2^{-M}+\omega_{f}\left(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{N}\right))$,
where $M,N\in \mathbb{N}^{+}$ denote the hyperparameters related to widths of
the networks. As a consequence, we can construct ReLU-sine-$2^x$ network with
the depth $5$ and width
$\max\left\{\left\lceil2d^{3/2}\left(\frac{3\mu}{\epsilon}\right)^{1/{\alpha}}\right\rceil,2\left\lceil\log_2\frac{3\mu

$\mathcal{H}_{\mu}^{\alpha}([0,1]^d)$ denotes the H\&quot;older continuous function
class defined on $[0,1]^d$ with order $\alpha \in (0,1]$ and constant $\mu &gt;
0$. Therefore, the ReLU-sine-$2^x$ networks overcome the curse of
dimensionality on $\mathcal{H}_{\mu}^{\alpha}([0,1]^d)$. In addition to its
supper expressive power, functions implemented by ReLU-sine-$2^x$ networks are
(generalized) differentiable, enabling us to apply SGD to train.</span>

Canadian adolescents related to cannabis use. We use a subset of COMPASS
dataset which contains 18,761 records of students in grades 9 to 12 with 31
selected features (attributes) involving various characteristics, from living
habits to academic performance. We then used the Pattern Discovery and
Disentanglement (PDD) algorithm that we have developed to detect strong and
rare (yet statistically significant) associations from the dataset. PDD used
the criteria derived from disentangled statistical spaces (known as
Re-projected Adjusted-Standardized Residual Vector Spaces, notated as RARV). It
outperformed methods using other criteria (i.e. support and confidence) popular
as reported in the literature. Association results showed that PDD can
discover: i) a smaller set of succinct significant associations in clusters;
ii) frequent and rare, yet significant, patterns supported by population health

                    <span>The recent progress in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning(MADRL) makes
it more practical in real-world tasks, but its relatively poor scalability and
the partially observable constraints raise challenges to its performance and
deployment. Based on our intuitive observation that the human society could be
regarded as a large-scale partially observable environment, where each
individual has the function of communicating with neighbors and remembering its
own experience, we propose a novel network structure called hierarchical graph
recurrent network(HGRN) for multi-agent cooperation under partial
observability. Specifically, we construct the multi-agent system as a graph,
use the hierarchical graph attention network(HGAT) to achieve communication
between neighboring agents, and exploit GRU to enable agents to record
historical information. To encourage exploration and improve robustness, we
design a maximum-entropy learning method to learn stochastic policies of a
configurable target action entropy. Based on the above technologies, we
proposed a value-based MADRL algorithm called Soft-HGRN and its actor-critic
variant named SAC-HRGN. Experimental results based on three homogeneous tasks
and one heterogeneous environment not only show that our approach achieves
clear improvements compared with four baselines, but also demonstrates the
interpretability, scalability, and transferability of the proposed model.

                    <span>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on society, both because
of the serious health effects of COVID-19 and because of public health measures
implemented to slow its spread. Many of these difficulties are fundamentally
information needs; attempts to address these needs have caused an information
overload for both researchers and the public. Natural language processing
(NLP), the branch of artificial intelligence that interprets human language,
can be applied to address many of the information needs made urgent by the
COVID-19 pandemic. This review surveys approximately 150 NLP studies and more
than 50 systems and datasets addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We detail work
on four core NLP tasks: information retrieval, named entity recognition,
literature-based discovery, and question answering. We also describe work that
directly addresses aspects of the pandemic through four additional tasks: topic
modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, caseload forecasting, and
misinformation detection. We conclude by discussing observable trends and

                    <span>Active learning has emerged as a standard paradigm in areas with scarcity of
labeled training data, such as in the medical domain. Language models have
emerged as the prevalent choice of several natural language tasks due to the
performance boost offered by these models. However, in several domains, such as
medicine, the scarcity of labeled training data is a common issue. Also, these
models may not work well in cases where class imbalance is prevalent. Active
learning may prove helpful in these cases to boost the performance with a
limited label budget. To this end, we propose a novel method using sampling
techniques based on submodular optimization and optimal transport for active
learning in language models, dubbed ALLWAS. We construct a sampling strategy
based on submodular optimization of the designed objective in the gradient
domain. Furthermore, to enable learning from few samples, we propose a novel
strategy for sampling from the Wasserstein barycenters. Our empirical
evaluations on standard benchmark datasets for text classification show that
our methods perform significantly better (&gt;20% relative increase in some cases)
than existing approaches for active learning on language models.</span>

                    <span>Tensor factorization has been proved as an efficient unsupervised learning
approach for health data analysis, especially for computational phenotyping,
where the high-dimensional Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with patients
history of medical procedures, medications, diagnosis, lab tests, etc., are
converted to meaningful and interpretable medical concepts. Federated tensor
factorization distributes the tensor computation to multiple workers under the
coordination of a central server, which enables jointly learning the phenotypes
across multiple hospitals while preserving the privacy of the patient
information. However, existing federated tensor factorization algorithms
encounter the single-point-failure issue with the involvement of the central
server, which is not only easily exposed to external attacks, but also limits
the number of clients sharing information with the server under restricted
uplink bandwidth. In this paper, we propose CiderTF, a communication-efficient
decentralized generalized tensor factorization, which reduces the uplink
communication cost by leveraging a four-level communication reduction strategy
designed for a generalized tensor factorization, which has the flexibility of
modeling different tensor distribution with multiple kinds of loss functions.
Experiments on two real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that CiderTF achieves
comparable convergence with the communication reduction up to 99.99%.</span>

                    <span>The robustness of the much-used Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to
perturbations of their input is becoming a topic of increasing importance. In
this paper, the random GCN is introduced for which a random matrix theory
analysis is possible. This analysis suggests that if the graph is sufficiently
perturbed, or in the extreme case random, then the GCN fails to benefit from
the node features. It is furthermore observed that enhancing the message
passing step in GCNs by adding the node feature kernel to the adjacency matrix
of the graph structure solves this problem. An empirical study of a GCN
utilised for node classification on six real datasets further confirms the
theoretical findings and demonstrates that perturbations of the graph structure
can result in GCNs performing significantly worse than Multi-Layer Perceptrons
run on the node features alone. In practice, adding a node feature kernel to
the message passing of perturbed graphs results in a significant improvement of
the GCN&#x27;s performance, thereby rendering it more robust to graph perturbations.

                    <span>Self-supervised learning provides an opportunity to explore unlabeled chest
X-rays and their associated free-text reports accumulated in clinical routine
without manual supervision. This paper proposes a Joint Image Text
Representation Learning Network (JoImTeRNet) for pre-training on chest X-ray
images and their radiology reports. The model was pre-trained on both the
global image-sentence level and the local image region-word level for
visual-textual matching. Both are bidirectionally constrained on Cross-Entropy
based and ranking-based Triplet Matching Losses. The region-word matching is
calculated using the attention mechanism without direct supervision about their
mapping. The pre-trained multi-modal representation learning paves the way for
downstream tasks concerning image and/or text encoding. We demonstrate the
representation learning quality by cross-modality retrievals and multi-label
classifications on two datasets: OpenI-IU and MIMIC-CXR</span>

                    <span>An optical neural network (ONN) is a promising system due to its high-speed
and low-power operation. Its linear unit performs a multiplication of an input
vector and a weight matrix in optical analog circuits. Among them, a circuit
with a multiple-layered structure of programmable Mach-Zehnder interferometers
(MZIs) can realize a specific class of unitary matrices with a limited number
of MZIs as its weight matrix. The circuit is effective for balancing the number
of programmable MZIs and ONN performance. However, it takes a lot of time to
learn MZI parameters of the circuit with a conventional automatic
differentiation (AD), which machine learning platforms are equipped with. To
solve the time-consuming problem, we propose an acceleration method for
learning MZI parameters. We create customized complex-valued derivatives for an
MZI, exploiting Wirtinger derivatives and a chain rule. They are incorporated
into our newly developed function module implemented in C++ to collectively
calculate their values in a multi-layered structure. Our method is simple,
fast, and versatile as well as compatible with the conventional AD. We
demonstrate that our method works 20 times faster than the conventional AD when
a pixel-by-pixel MNIST task is performed in a complex-valued recurrent neural
network with an MZI-based hidden unit.</span>

                    <span>Federated edge learning (FEEL) has emerged as a revolutionary paradigm to
develop AI services at the edge of 6G wireless networks as it supports
collaborative model training at a massive number of mobile devices. However,
model communication over wireless channels, especially in uplink model
uploading of FEEL, has been widely recognized as a bottleneck that critically
limits the efficiency of FEEL. Although over-the-air computation can alleviate
the excessive cost of radio resources in FEEL model uploading, practical
implementations of over-the-air FEEL still suffer from several challenges,
including strong straggler issues, large communication overheads, and potential
privacy leakage. In this article, we study these challenges in over-the-air
FEEL and leverage reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), a key enabler of
future wireless systems, to address these challenges. We study the
state-of-the-art solutions on RIS-empowered FEEL and explore the promising
research opportunities for adopting RIS to enhance FEEL performance.</span>

                    <span>In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have experienced an
increasing interest for their ability to perform fast approximation of
effective hydrodynamic parameters in porous media research and applications.
This paper presents a novel methodology for permeability prediction from
micro-CT scans of geological rock samples. The training data set for CNNs
dedicated to permeability prediction consists of permeability labels that are
typically generated by classical lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) that simulate
the flow through the pore space of the segmented image data. We instead perform
direct numerical simulation (DNS) by solving the stationary Stokes equation in
an efficient and distributed-parallel manner. As such, we circumvent the
convergence issues of LBM that frequently are observed on complex pore
geometries, and therefore, improve on the generality and accuracy of our
training data set. Using the DNS-computed permeabilities, a physics-informed
CNN PhyCNN) is trained by additionally providing a tailored characteristic
quantity of the pore space. More precisely, by exploiting the connection to
flow problems on a graph representation of the pore space, additional
information about confined structures is provided to the network in terms of
the maximum flow value, which is the key innovative component of our workflow.
As a result, unprecedented prediction accuracy and robustness are observed for
a variety of sandstone samples from archetypal rock formations.</span>

                    <span>As a novel similarity measure that is defined as the expectation of a kernel
function between two random variables, correntropy has been successfully
applied in robust machine learning and signal processing to combat large
outliers. The kernel function in correntropy is usually a zero-mean Gaussian
kernel. In a recent work, the concept of mixture correntropy (MC) was proposed
to improve the learning performance, where the kernel function is a mixture
Gaussian kernel, namely a linear combination of several zero-mean Gaussian
kernels with different widths. In both correntropy and mixture correntropy, the
center of the kernel function is, however, always located at zero. In the
present work, to further improve the learning performance, we propose the
concept of multi-kernel correntropy (MKC), in which each component of the
mixture Gaussian kernel can be centered at a different location. The properties
of the MKC are investigated and an efficient approach is proposed to determine
the free parameters in MKC. Experimental results show that the learning
algorithms under the maximum multi-kernel correntropy criterion (MMKCC) can
outperform those under the original maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) and the
maximum mixture correntropy criterion (MMCC).</span>

                    <span>Attention mechanisms are developing into a viable alternative to
convolutional layers as elementary building block of NNs. Their main advantage
is that they are not restricted to capture local dependencies in the input, but
can draw arbitrary connections. This unprecedented capability coincides with
the long-standing problem of modeling global atomic interactions in molecular
force fields and other many-body problems. In its original formulation,
however, attention is not applicable to the continuous domains in which the
atoms live. For this purpose we propose a variant to describe geometric
relations for arbitrary atomic configurations in Euclidean space that also
respects all relevant physical symmetries. We furthermore demonstrate, how the
successive application of our learned attention matrices effectively translates
the molecular geometry into a set of individual atomic contributions
on-the-fly.</span>

                    <span>We propose a novel 3D fully convolutional deep network for automated pancreas
segmentation from both MRI and CT scans. More specifically, the proposed model
consists of a 3D encoder that learns to extract volume features at different
scales; features taken at different points of the encoder hierarchy are then
sent to multiple 3D decoders that individually predict intermediate
segmentation maps. Finally, all segmentation maps are combined to obtain a
unique detailed segmentation mask. We test our model on both CT and MRI imaging
data: the publicly available NIH Pancreas-CT dataset (consisting of 82
contrast-enhanced CTs) and a private MRI dataset (consisting of 40 MRI scans).
Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing methods on CT
pancreas segmentation, obtaining an average Dice score of about 88%, and yields
promising segmentation performance on a very challenging MRI data set (average
Dice score is about 77%). Additional control experiments demonstrate that the
achieved performance is due to the combination of our 3D fully-convolutional
deep network and the hierarchical representation decoding, thus substantiating
our architectural design.</span>

                    <span>Let $\mathbf{X} &#x3D; (X_i)_{1\leq i \leq n}$ be an i.i.d. sample of
square-integrable variables in $\mathbb{R}^d$, with common expectation $\mu$
and covariance matrix $\Sigma$, both unknown. We consider the problem of
testing if $\mu$ is $\eta$-close to zero, i.e. $\|\mu\| \leq \eta $ against
$\|\mu\| \geq (\eta + \delta)$; we also tackle the more general two-sample mean
closeness testing problem. The aim of this paper is to obtain nonasymptotic
upper and lower bounds on the minimal separation distance $\delta$ such that we
can control both the Type I and Type II errors at a given level. The main
technical tools are concentration inequalities, first for a suitable estimator
of $\|\mu\|^2$ used a test statistic, and secondly for estimating the operator
and Frobenius norms of $\Sigma$ coming into the quantiles of said test
statistic. These properties are obtained for Gaussian and bounded
distributions. A particular attention is given to the dependence in the
pseudo-dimension $d_*$ of the distribution, defined as $d_* :&#x3D;
\|\Sigma\|_2^2/\|\Sigma\|_\infty^2$. In particular, for $\eta&#x3D;0$, the minimum
separation distance is ${\Theta}(d_*^{\frac{1}{4}}\sqrt{\|\Sigma\|_\infty/n})$,
in contrast with the minimax estimation distance for $\mu$, which is
${\Theta}(d_e^{\frac{1}{2}}\sqrt{\|\Sigma\|_\infty/n})$ (where
$d_e:&#x3D;\|\Sigma\|_1/\|\Sigma\|_\infty$). This generalizes a phenomenon spelled
out in particular by Baraud (2002).</span>

                    <span>Quantifying and verifying the control level in preparing a quantum state are
central challenges in building quantum devices. The quantum state is
characterized from experimental measurements, using a procedure known as
tomography, which requires a vast number of resources. Furthermore, the
tomography for a quantum device with temporal processing, which is
fundamentally different from the standard tomography, has not been formulated.
We develop a practical and approximate tomography method using a recurrent
machine learning framework for this intriguing situation. The method is based
on repeated quantum interactions between a system called quantum reservoir with
a stream of quantum states. Measurement data from the reservoir are connected
to a linear readout to train a recurrent relation between quantum channels
applied to the input stream. We demonstrate our algorithms for quantum learning
tasks followed by the proposal of a quantum short-term memory capacity to
evaluate the temporal processing ability of near-term quantum devices.</span>

                    <span>Neural networks inspired by differential equations have proliferated for the
past several years. Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and neural
controlled differential equations (NCDEs) are two representative examples of
them. In theory, NCDEs provide better representation learning capability for
time-series data than NODEs. In particular, it is known that NCDEs are suitable
for processing irregular time-series data. Whereas NODEs have been successfully
extended after adopting attention, however, it had not been studied yet how to
integrate attention into NCDEs. To this end, we present the method of Attentive
Neural Controlled Differential Equations (ANCDEs) for time-series
classification and forecasting, where dual NCDEs are used: one for generating
attention values, and the other for evolving hidden vectors for a downstream
machine learning task. We conduct experiments with three real-world time-series
datasets and 10 baselines. After dropping some values, we also conduct
irregular time-series experiments. Our method consistently shows the best
accuracy in all cases by non-trivial margins. Our visualizations also show that
the presented attention mechanism works as intended by focusing on crucial
information.</span>

overcome some of the shortcomings of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
However, CapsNets have mainly outperformed CNNs in datasets where images are
small and/or the objects to identify have minimal background noise. In this
work, we present a new architecture, parallel CapsNets, which exploits the
concept of branching the network to isolate certain capsules, allowing each
branch to identify different entities. We applied our concept to the two
current types of CapsNet architectures, studying the performance for networks
with different layers of capsules. We tested our design in a public, highly
unbalanced dataset of acute myeloid leukaemia images (15 classes). Our
experiments showed that conventional CapsNets show similar performance than our
baseline CNN (ResNeXt-50) but depict instability problems. In contrast,
parallel CapsNets can outperform ResNeXt-50, is more stable, and shows better
rotational invariance than both, conventional CapsNets and ResNeXt-50.</span>

                    <span>Humans (e.g., crowdworkers) have a remarkable ability in solving different
tasks, by simply reading textual instructions that define them and looking at a
few examples. NLP models built with the conventional paradigm, however, often
struggle with generalization across tasks (e.g., a question-answering system
cannot solve classification tasks). A long-standing challenge in AI is to build
a model that is equipped with the understanding of human-readable instructions
that define the tasks, and can generalize to new tasks. To study this, we
introduce NATURAL INSTRUCTIONS, a dataset of 61 distinct tasks, their
human-authored instructions and 193k task instances. The instructions are
obtained from crowdsourcing instructions used to collect existing NLP datasets
and mapped to a unified schema. We adopt generative pre-trained language models
to encode task-specific instructions along with input and generate task output.
Our results indicate that models can benefit from instructions to generalize
across tasks. These models, however, are far behind supervised task-specific
models, indicating significant room for more progress in this direction.</span>

an effective architecture for scaling attention-based models to more parameters
with comparable computation cost. In this paper, we propose Sparse-MLP, scaling
the recent MLP-Mixer model with sparse MoE layers, to achieve a more
computation-efficient architecture. We replace a subset of dense MLP blocks in
the MLP-Mixer model with Sparse blocks. In each Sparse block, we apply two
stages of MoE layers: one with MLP experts mixing information within channels
along image patch dimension, one with MLP experts mixing information within
patches along the channel dimension. Besides, to reduce computational cost in
routing and improve experts capacity, we design Re-represent layers in each
Sparse block. These layers are to re-scale image representations by two simple
but effective linear transformations. By pre-training on ImageNet-1k with MoCo
v3 algorithm, our models can outperform dense MLP models with comparable
parameters and less computational cost on several downstream image

necessarily with administrative borders as they are built observing natural
human mobility and, therefore, they can be used to inform, in a bottom-up

After presenting the methodology behind the MFAs, this study focuses on the

                    <span>Vision-and-language (V\&amp;L) reasoning necessitates perception of visual
concepts such as objects and actions, understanding semantics and language
grounding, and reasoning about the interplay between the two modalities. One
crucial aspect of visual reasoning is spatial understanding, which involves
understanding relative locations of objects, i.e.\ implicitly learning the
geometry of the scene. In this work, we evaluate the faithfulness of V\&amp;L
models to such geometric understanding, by formulating the prediction of
pair-wise relative locations of objects as a classification as well as a
regression task. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art transformer-based
V\&amp;L models lack sufficient abilities to excel at this task. Motivated by this,
we design two objectives as proxies for 3D spatial reasoning (SR) -- object
centroid estimation, and relative position estimation, and train V\&amp;L with weak
supervision from off-the-shelf depth estimators. This leads to considerable
improvements in accuracy for the &quot;GQA&quot; visual question answering challenge (in
fully supervised, few-shot, and O.O.D settings) as well as improvements in
relative spatial reasoning. Code and data will be released

                    <span>Simulating crowds requires controlling a very large number of trajectories
and is usually performed using crowd motion algorithms for which appropriate
parameter values need to be found. The study of the relation between parametric
values for simulation techniques and the quality of the resulting trajectories
has been studied either through perceptual experiments or by comparison with
real crowd trajectories. In this paper, we integrate both strategies. A quality
metric, QF, is proposed to abstract from reference data while capturing the
most salient features that affect the perception of trajectory realism. QF
weights and combines cost functions that are based on several individual, local
and global properties of trajectories. These trajectory features are selected
from the literature and from interviews with experts. To validate the capacity
of QF to capture perceived trajectory quality, we conduct an online experiment
that demonstrates the high agreement between the automatic quality score and
non-expert users. To further demonstrate the usefulness of QF, we use it in a
data-free parameter tuning application able to tune any parametric microscopic
crowd simulation model that outputs independent trajectories for characters.
The learnt parameters for the tuned crowd motion model maintain the influence
of the reference data which was used to weight the terms of QF.</span>

                    <span>Recently, many datasets have been proposed to test the systematic
generalization ability of neural networks. The companion baseline Transformers,
typically trained with default hyper-parameters from standard tasks, are shown
to fail dramatically. Here we demonstrate that by revisiting model
configurations as basic as scaling of embeddings, early stopping, relative
positional embedding, and Universal Transformer variants, we can drastically
improve the performance of Transformers on systematic generalization. We report
improvements on five popular datasets: SCAN, CFQ, PCFG, COGS, and Mathematics
dataset. Our models improve accuracy from 50% to 85% on the PCFG productivity
split, and from 35% to 81% on COGS. On SCAN, relative positional embedding
largely mitigates the EOS decision problem (Newman et al., 2020), yielding 100%
accuracy on the length split with a cutoff at 26. Importantly, performance
differences between these models are typically invisible on the IID data split.
This calls for proper generalization validation sets for developing neural
networks that generalize systematically. We publicly release the code to
reproduce our results.</span>

                    <span>Considerable research has been devoted to deep learning-based predictive
models for system prognostics and health management in the reliability and
safety community. However, there is limited study on the utilization of deep
learning for system reliability assessment. This paper aims to bridge this gap
and explore this new interface between deep learning and system reliability
assessment by exploiting the recent advances of physics-informed deep learning.
Particularly, we present an approach to frame system reliability assessment in
the context of physics-informed deep learning and discuss the potential value
of physics-informed generative adversarial networks for the uncertainty
quantification and measurement data incorporation in system reliability
assessment. The proposed approach is demonstrated by three numerical examples
involving a dual-processor computing system. The results indicate the potential
value of physics-informed deep learning to alleviate computational challenges

                    <span>This paper considers the open challenge of identifying complete, concise, and
explainable quantitative microstructure representations for disordered
heterogeneous material systems. Completeness and conciseness have been achieved
through existing data-driven methods, e.g., deep generative models, which,
however, do not provide mathematically explainable latent representations. This
study investigates representations composed of three-point correlation
functions, which are a special type of spatial convolutions. We show that a
variety of microstructures can be characterized by a concise subset of
three-point correlations, and the identification of such subsets can be
achieved by Bayesian optimization. Lastly, we show that the proposed
representation can directly be used to compute material properties based on the
effective medium theory.</span>

In this formulation, we aim to generate representations of the data that keep a
prescribed level of the relevant information that is not shared by the private

proposed approach (i) exhibits the similarities of the privacy and fairness
problems, (ii) allows us to control the trade-off between utility and privacy

                    <span>We propose a theoretical framework for approximate planning and learning in
partially observed systems. Our framework is based on the fundamental notion of
information state. We provide two equivalent definitions of information state
-- i) a function of history which is sufficient to compute the expected reward
and predict its next value; ii) equivalently, a function of the history which
can be recursively updated and is sufficient to compute the expected reward and
predict the next observation. An information state always leads to a dynamic
programming decomposition. Our key result is to show that if a function of the
history (called approximate information state (AIS)) approximately satisfies
the properties of the information state, then there is a corresponding
approximate dynamic program. We show that the policy computed using this is
approximately optimal with bounded loss of optimality. We show that several
approximations in state, observation and action spaces in literature can be
viewed as instances of AIS. In some of these cases, we obtain tighter bounds. A
salient feature of AIS is that it can be learnt from data. We present AIS based
multi-time scale policy gradient algorithms. and detailed numerical experiments
with low, moderate and high dimensional environments.</span>

                    <span>Similar to the role of Markov decision processes in reinforcement learning,
Stochastic Games (SGs) lay the foundation for the study of multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) and sequential agent interactions. In this paper,
we derive that computing an approximate Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE) in a
finite-state discounted Stochastic Game within the exponential precision is
\textbf{PPAD}-complete. We adopt a function with a polynomially bounded
description in the strategy space to convert the MPE computation to a
fixed-point problem, even though the stochastic game may demand an exponential
number of pure strategies, in the number of states, for each agent. The
completeness result follows the reduction of the fixed-point problem to {\sc
End of the Line}. Our results indicate that finding an MPE in SGs is highly
unlikely to be \textbf{NP}-hard unless \textbf{NP}&#x3D;\textbf{co-NP}. Our work
offers confidence for MARL research to study MPE computation on general-sum SGs
and to develop fruitful algorithms as currently on zero-sum SGs.</span>

                    <span>In deep neural networks, better results can often be obtained by increasing
the complexity of previously developed basic models. However, it is unclear
whether there is a way to boost performance by decreasing the complexity of
such models. Here, based on an optimization method, we investigate the
feasibility of improving graph classification performance while simplifying the
model learning process. Inspired by progress in structural information
assessment, we optimize the given data sample from graphs to encoding trees. In
particular, we minimize the structural entropy of the transformed encoding tree
to decode the key structure underlying a graph. This transformation is denoted
as structural optimization. Furthermore, we propose a novel feature combination
scheme, termed hierarchical reporting, for encoding trees. In this scheme,
features are transferred from leaf nodes to root nodes by following the
hierarchical structures of encoding trees. We then present an implementation of
the scheme in a tree kernel and a convolutional network to perform graph
classification. The tree kernel follows label propagation in the
Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) subtree kernel, but it has a lower runtime complexity
$O(n)$. The convolutional network is a special implementation of our tree
kernel in the deep learning field and is called Encoding Tree Learning (ETL).
We empirically validate our tree kernel and convolutional network with several
graph classification benchmarks and demonstrate that our methods achieve better
performance and lower computational consumption than competing approaches.</span>

applications, which includes medical and remote sensing image analysis. Despite
recent advances with deep-based approaches, labeling samples (pixels) for
training models is laborious and, in some cases, unfeasible. In this paper, we
present two novel meta learning methods, named WeaSeL and ProtoSeg, for the
few-shot semantic segmentation task with sparse annotations. We conducted
extensive evaluation of the proposed methods in different applications (12
datasets) in medical imaging and agricultural remote sensing, which are very
distinct fields of knowledge and usually subject to data scarcity. The results
demonstrated the potential of our method, achieving suitable results for

                    <span>Using only a model that was trained to predict where people look at images,
and no additional training data, we can produce a range of powerful editing
effects for reducing distraction in images. Given an image and a mask
specifying the region to edit, we backpropagate through a state-of-the-art
saliency model to parameterize a differentiable editing operator, such that the
saliency within the masked region is reduced. We demonstrate several operators,
including: a recoloring operator, which learns to apply a color transform that
camouflages and blends distractors into their surroundings; a warping operator,
which warps less salient image regions to cover distractors, gradually
collapsing objects into themselves and effectively removing them (an effect
akin to inpainting); a GAN operator, which uses a semantic prior to fully
replace image regions with plausible, less salient alternatives. The resulting
effects are consistent with cognitive research on the human visual system
(e.g., since color mismatch is salient, the recoloring operator learns to
harmonize objects&#x27; colors with their surrounding to reduce their saliency),
and, importantly, are all achieved solely through the guidance of the
pretrained saliency model, with no additional supervision. We present results
on a variety of natural images and conduct a perceptual study to evaluate and
validate the changes in viewers&#x27; eye-gaze between the original images and our

                    <span>We consider the problem of assessing the changing knowledge state of
individual students as they go through online courses. This student performance
(SP) modeling problem, also known as knowledge tracing, is a critical step for
building adaptive online teaching systems. Specifically, we conduct a study of
how to utilize various types and large amounts of students log data to train
accurate machine learning models that predict the knowledge state of future
students. This study is the first to use four very large datasets made
available recently from four distinct intelligent tutoring systems. Our results
include a new machine learning approach that defines a new state of the art for
SP modeling, improving over earlier methods in several ways: First, we achieve
improved accuracy by introducing new features that can be easily computed from
conventional question-response logs (e.g., the pattern in the student&#x27;s most
recent answers). Second, we take advantage of features of the student history
that go beyond question-response pairs (e.g., which video segments the student
watched, or skipped) as well as information about prerequisite structure in the
curriculum. Third, we train multiple specialized modeling models for different
aspects of the curriculum (e.g., specializing in early versus later segments of
the student history), then combine these specialized models to create a group
prediction of student knowledge. Taken together, these innovations yield an
average AUC score across these four datasets of 0.807 compared to the previous
best logistic regression approach score of 0.766, and also outperforming
state-of-the-art deep neural net approaches. Importantly, we observe consistent
improvements from each of our three methodological innovations, in each
dataset, suggesting that our methods are of general utility and likely to
produce improvements for other online tutoring systems as well.</span>

                    <span>One of the goals of every business enterprise is to increase customer
loyalty. The degree of customer loyalty is called customer quality which its
forecasting will affect strategic marketing practices. The purpose of this
study is to predict the quality of customers of large e-commerce social
networks by big data algorithms and unsupervised learning. For this purpose, a
graph-based social network analysis framework was used for community detection
in the Stanford Network Analysis Platform (SNAP). Then in the found
communities, the quality of customers was predicted. The results showed that
various visits with an impact of 37.13% can have the greatest impact on
customer quality and the order of impact of other parameters were from highest
to lowest: number of frequent customer visits (28.56%), role in social networks
(28.37%), Indirect transactions (26.74%), activity days (25.62%) and customer
social network size (25.06%).</span>

                    <span>Several approaches have been proposed in recent literature to alleviate the
long-tail problem, mainly in object classification tasks. In this paper, we
make the first large-scale study concerning the task of Long-Tail Visual
Relationship Recognition (LTVRR). LTVRR aims at improving the learning of
structured visual relationships that come from the long-tail (e.g., &quot;rabbit
grazing on grass&quot;). In this setup, the subject, relation, and object classes
each follow a long-tail distribution. To begin our study and make a future
benchmark for the community, we introduce two LTVRR-related benchmarks, dubbed
VG8K-LT and GQA-LT, built upon the widely used Visual Genome and GQA datasets.
We use these benchmarks to study the performance of several state-of-the-art
long-tail models on the LTVRR setup. Lastly, we propose a visiolinguistic
hubless (VilHub) loss and a Mixup augmentation technique adapted to LTVRR
setup, dubbed as RelMix. Both VilHub and RelMix can be easily integrated on top
of existing models and despite being simple, our results show that they can
remarkably improve the performance, especially on tail classes. Benchmarks,
code, and models have been made available at:

                    <span>General AI system solves a wide range of tasks with high performance in an
automated fashion. The best general AI algorithm designed by one individual is
different from that devised by another. The best performance records achieved
by different users are also different. An inevitable component of general AI is
tacit knowledge that depends upon user-specific comprehension of task
information and individual model design preferences that are related to user
technical experiences. Tacit knowledge affects model performance but cannot be
automatically optimized in general AI algorithms. In this paper, we propose
User-Oriented Smart General AI System under Causal Inference, abbreviated as
UOGASuCI, where UOGAS represents User-Oriented General AI System and uCI means
under the framework of causal inference. User characteristics that have a
significant influence upon tacit knowledge can be extracted from observed model
training experiences of many users in external memory modules. Under the
framework of causal inference, we manage to identify the optimal value of user
characteristics that are connected with the best model performance designed by
users. We make suggestions to users about how different user characteristics
can improve the best model performance achieved by users. By recommending
updating user characteristics associated with individualized tacit knowledge
comprehension and technical preferences, UOGAS helps users design models with
better performance.</span>

                    <span>We develop Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning (UDRL), a method for learning
to act using only supervised learning techniques. Unlike traditional
algorithms, UDRL does not use reward prediction or search for an optimal
policy. Instead, it trains agents to follow commands such as &quot;obtain so much
total reward in so much time.&quot; Many of its general principles are outlined in a
companion report; the goal of this paper is to develop a practical learning
algorithm and show that this conceptually simple perspective on agent training
can produce a range of rewarding behaviors for multiple episodic environments.
Experiments show that on some tasks UDRL&#x27;s performance can be surprisingly
competitive with, and even exceed that of some traditional baseline algorithms
developed over decades of research. Based on these results, we suggest that
alternative approaches to expected reward maximization have an important role
to play in training useful autonomous agents.</span>

                    <span>From CNNs to attention mechanisms, encoding inductive biases into neural
networks has been a fruitful source of improvement in machine learning. Adding
auxiliary losses to the main objective function is a general way of encoding
biases that can help networks learn better representations. However, since
auxiliary losses are minimized only on training data, they suffer from the same
generalization gap as regular task losses. Moreover, by adding a term to the
loss function, the model optimizes a different objective than the one we care
about. In this work we address both problems: first, we take inspiration from
\textit{transductive learning} and note that after receiving an input but
before making a prediction, we can fine-tune our networks on any unsupervised
loss. We call this process {\em tailoring}, because we customize the model to
each input to ensure our prediction satisfies the inductive bias. Second, we
formulate {\em meta-tailoring}, a nested optimization similar to that in
meta-learning, and train our models to perform well on the task objective after
adapting them using an unsupervised loss. The advantages of tailoring and
meta-tailoring are discussed theoretically and demonstrated empirically on a
diverse set of examples.</span>

                    <span>We learn an interactive vision-based driving policy from pre-recorded driving
logs via a model-based approach. A forward model of the world supervises a
driving policy that predicts the outcome of any potential driving trajectory.
To support learning from pre-recorded logs, we assume that the world is on
rails, meaning neither the agent nor its actions influence the environment.
This assumption greatly simplifies the learning problem, factorizing the
dynamics into a nonreactive world model and a low-dimensional and compact
forward model of the ego-vehicle. Our approach computes action-values for each
training trajectory using a tabular dynamic-programming evaluation of the
Bellman equations; these action-values in turn supervise the final vision-based
driving policy. Despite the world-on-rails assumption, the final driving policy
acts well in a dynamic and reactive world. At the time of writing, our method
ranks first on the CARLA leaderboard, attaining a 25% higher driving score
while using 40 times less data. Our method is also an order of magnitude more
sample-efficient than state-of-the-art model-free reinforcement learning
techniques on navigational tasks in the ProcGen benchmark.</span>

                    <span>Cough is a major symptom of respiratory-related diseases. There exists a
tremendous amount of work in detecting coughs from audio but there has been no
effort to identify coughs from solely inertial measurement unit (IMU). Coughing
causes motion across the whole body and especially on the neck and head.
Therefore, head motion data during coughing captured by a head-worn IMU sensor
could be leveraged to detect coughs using a template matching algorithm. In
time series template matching problems, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) combined with
elastic distance measurement (esp. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)) achieves
outstanding performance. However, it is often regarded as prohibitively
time-consuming. Nearest Centroid Classifier is thereafter proposed. But the
accuracy is comprised of only one centroid obtained for each class.
Centroid-based Classifier performs clustering and averaging for each cluster,
but requires manually setting the number of clusters. We propose a novel
self-tuning multi-centroid template-matching algorithm, which can automatically
adjust the number of clusters to balance accuracy and inference time. Through
experiments conducted on synthetic datasets and a real-world earbud-based cough
dataset, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm and present
the result of cough detection with a single accelerometer sensor on the earbuds
platform.</span>

                    <span>Network quantization, which aims to reduce the bit-lengths of the network
weights and activations, has emerged for their deployments to resource-limited
devices. Although recent studies have successfully discretized a full-precision
network, they still incur large quantization errors after training, thus giving
rise to a significant performance gap between a full-precision network and its
quantized counterpart. In this work, we propose a novel quantization method for
neural networks, Cluster-Promoting Quantization (CPQ) that finds the optimal
quantization grids while naturally encouraging the underlying full-precision
weights to gather around those quantization grids cohesively during training.
This property of CPQ is thanks to our two main ingredients that enable
differentiable quantization: i) the use of the categorical distribution
designed by a specific probabilistic parametrization in the forward pass and
ii) our proposed multi-class straight-through estimator (STE) in the backward
pass. Since our second component, multi-class STE, is intrinsically biased, we
additionally propose a new bit-drop technique, DropBits, that revises the
standard dropout regularization to randomly drop bits instead of neurons. As a
natural extension of DropBits, we further introduce the way of learning
heterogeneous quantization levels to find proper bit-length for each layer by
imposing an additional regularization on DropBits. We experimentally validate
our method on various benchmark datasets and network architectures, and also
support a new hypothesis for quantization: learning heterogeneous quantization
levels outperforms the case using the same but fixed quantization levels from
scratch.</span>

combination of Siamese networks and radial basis function networks to perform
data-efficient classification without pretraining by measuring the distance
between images in semantic space in a data-efficient manner. We develop the
models using three technical datasets, the NEU dataset, the BSD dataset, and
the TEX dataset. In addition to the technical domain, we show the general
applicability to classical datasets (cifar10 and MNIST) as well. The approach
is tested against state-of-the-art models (Resnet50 and Resnet101) by stepwise
reduction of the number of samples available for training. The authors show

                    <span>Sampling methods (e.g., node-wise, layer-wise, or subgraph) has become an
indispensable strategy to speed up training large-scale Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs). However, existing sampling methods are mostly based on the graph
structural information and ignore the dynamicity of optimization, which leads
to high variance in estimating the stochastic gradients. The high variance
issue can be very pronounced in extremely large graphs, where it results in
slow convergence and poor generalization. In this paper, we theoretically
analyze the variance of sampling methods and show that, due to the composite
structure of empirical risk, the variance of any sampling method can be
decomposed into \textit{embedding approximation variance} in the forward stage
and \textit{stochastic gradient variance} in the backward stage that
necessities mitigating both types of variance to obtain faster convergence
rate. We propose a decoupled variance reduction strategy that employs
(approximate) gradient information to adaptively sample nodes with minimal
variance, and explicitly reduces the variance introduced by embedding
approximation. We show theoretically and empirically that the proposed method,
even with smaller mini-batch sizes, enjoys a faster convergence rate and
entails a better generalization compared to the existing methods.</span>

                    <span>To understand the black-box characteristics of deep networks, counterfactual
explanation that deduces not only the important features of an input space but
also how those features should be modified to classify input as a target class
has gained an increasing interest. The patterns that deep networks have learned
from a training dataset can be grasped by observing the feature variation among
various classes. However, current approaches perform the feature modification
to increase the classification probability for the target class irrespective of
the internal characteristics of deep networks. This often leads to unclear
explanations that deviate from real-world data distributions. To address this
problem, we propose a counterfactual explanation method that exploits the
statistics learned from a training dataset. Especially, we gradually construct
an explanation by iterating over masking and composition steps. The masking
step aims to select an important feature from the input data to be classified
as a target class. Meanwhile, the composition step aims to optimize the
previously selected feature by ensuring that its output score is close to the
logit space of the training data that are classified as the target class.
Experimental results show that our method produces human-friendly
interpretations on various classification datasets and verify that such
interpretations can be achieved with fewer feature modification.</span>

                    <span>Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) are widely used for building ranking
and relevance models in search and recommendation. Considerations such as
latency and interpretability dictate the use of as few features as possible to
train these models. Feature selection in GBDT models typically involves
heuristically ranking the features by importance and selecting the top few, or
by performing a full backward feature elimination routine. On-the-fly feature
selection methods proposed previously scale suboptimally with the number of
features, which can be daunting in high dimensional settings. We develop a
scalable forward feature selection variant for GBDT, via a novel group testing
procedure that works well in high dimensions, and enjoys favorable theoretical
performance and computational guarantees. We show via extensive experiments on
both public and proprietary datasets that the proposed method offers
significant speedups in training time, while being as competitive as existing
GBDT methods in terms of model performance metrics. We also extend the method
to the multitask setting, allowing the practitioner to select common features
across tasks, as well as selecting task-specific features.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we propose a novel normalization method called gradient
normalization (GN) to tackle the training instability of Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) caused by the sharp gradient space. Unlike existing work such
as gradient penalty and spectral normalization, the proposed GN only imposes a
hard 1-Lipschitz constraint on the discriminator function, which increases the
capacity of the discriminator. Moreover, the proposed gradient normalization
can be applied to different GAN architectures with little modification.
Extensive experiments on four datasets show that GANs trained with gradient
normalization outperform existing methods in terms of both Frechet Inception
Distance and Inception Score.</span>

                    <span>The race to meet the challenges of the global pandemic has served as a
reminder that the existing drug discovery process is expensive, inefficient and
slow. There is a major bottleneck screening the vast number of potential small
molecules to shortlist lead compounds for antiviral drug development. New
opportunities to accelerate drug discovery lie at the interface between machine
learning methods, in this case developed for linear accelerators, and
physics-based methods. The two in silico methods, each have their own
advantages and limitations which, interestingly, complement each other. Here,
we present an innovative infrastructural development that combines both
approaches to accelerate drug discovery. The scale of the potential resulting
workflow is such that it is dependent on supercomputing to achieve extremely
high throughput. We have demonstrated the viability of this workflow for the
study of inhibitors for four COVID-19 target proteins and our ability to
perform the required large-scale calculations to identify lead antiviral
compounds through repurposing on a variety of supercomputers.</span>

                    <span>Adversarial training (AT) has been demonstrated as one of the most promising
defense methods against various adversarial attacks. To our knowledge, existing
AT-based methods usually train with the locally most adversarial perturbed
points and treat all the perturbed points equally, which may lead to
considerably weaker adversarial robust generalization on test data. In this
work, we introduce a new adversarial training framework that considers the
diversity as well as characteristics of the perturbed points in the vicinity of
benign samples. To realize the framework, we propose a Regional Adversarial
Training (RAT) defense method that first utilizes the attack path generated by
the typical iterative attack method of projected gradient descent (PGD), and
constructs an adversarial region based on the attack path. Then, RAT samples
diverse perturbed training points efficiently inside this region, and utilizes
a distance-aware label smoothing mechanism to capture our intuition that
perturbed points at different locations should have different impact on the
model performance. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show
that RAT consistently makes significant improvement on standard adversarial
training (SAT), and exhibits better robust generalization.</span>

                    <span>SARS-CoV-2, like any other virus, continues to mutate as it spreads,
according to an evolutionary process. Unlike any other virus, the number of
currently available sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in public databases such as GISAID
is already several million. This amount of data has the potential to uncover
the evolutionary dynamics of a virus like never before. However, a million is
already several orders of magnitude beyond what can be processed by the
traditional methods designed to reconstruct a virus&#x27;s evolutionary history,
such as those that build a phylogenetic tree. Hence, new and scalable methods
will need to be devised in order to make use of the ever increasing number of
viral sequences being collected.

Since identifying variants is an important part of understanding the
evolution of a virus, in this paper, we propose an approach based on clustering
sequences to identify the current major SARS-CoV-2 variants. Using a $k$-mer
based feature vector generation and efficient feature selection methods, our
approach is effective in identifying variants, as well as being efficient and
scalable to millions of sequences. Such a clustering method allows us to show
the relative proportion of each variant over time, giving the rate of spread of
each variant in different locations -- something which is important for vaccine
development and distribution. We also compute the importance of each amino acid
position of the spike protein in identifying a given variant in terms of
information gain. Positions of high variant-specific importance tend to agree
with those reported by the USA&#x27;s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), further demonstrating our approach.</span>

                    <span>This paper is concerned with a state-space approach to deep Gaussian process
(DGP) regression. We construct the DGP by hierarchically putting transformed
Gaussian process (GP) priors on the length scales and magnitudes of the next
level of Gaussian processes in the hierarchy. The idea of the state-space
approach is to represent the DGP as a non-linear hierarchical system of linear
stochastic differential equations (SDEs), where each SDE corresponds to a
conditional GP. The DGP regression problem then becomes a state estimation
problem, and we can estimate the state efficiently with sequential methods by
using the Markov property of the state-space DGP. The computational complexity
scales linearly with respect to the number of measurements. Based on this, we
formulate state-space MAP as well as Bayesian filtering and smoothing solutions
to the DGP regression problem. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed
models and methods on synthetic non-stationary signals and apply the
state-space DGP to detection of the gravitational waves from LIGO measurements.</span>

                    <span>In this article, we propose a systematic approach for fire station location
planning. We develop a machine learning model, based on Random Forest, for
demand prediction and utilize the model further to define a generalized index
to measure quality of fire service in urban settings. Our model is built upon
spatial data collected from multiple different sources. Efficacy of proper
facility planning depends on choice of candidates where fire stations can be
located along with existing stations, if any. Also, the travel time from these
candidates to demand locations need to be taken care of to maintain fire safety
standard. Here, we propose a travel time based clustering technique to identify
suitable candidates. Finally, we develop an optimization problem to select best
locations to install new fire stations. Our optimization problem is built upon
maximum coverage problem, based on integer programming. We present a detailed
experimental study of our proposed approach in collaboration with city of
Victoria Fire Department, MN, USA. Our demand prediction model achieves true
positive rate of 70% and false positive rate of 22% approximately. We aid
Victoria Fire Department to select a location for a new fire station using our
approach. We present detailed results on improvement statistics by locating a
new facility, as suggested by our methodology, in the city of Victoria.</span>

                    <span>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have witnessed an unprecedented proliferation in
tackling several problems in computer vision, computer-aided diagnosis, and
related fields. While prior studies have focused on boosting the model
accuracy, quantifying the reproducibility of the most discriminative features
identified by GNNs is still an intact problem that yields concerns about their
reliability in clinical applications in particular. Specifically, the
reproducibility of biological markers across clinical datasets and distribution
shifts across classes (e.g., healthy and disordered brains) is of paramount
importance in revealing the underpinning mechanisms of diseases as well as
propelling the development of personalized treatment. Motivated by these
issues, we propose, for the first time, reproducibility-based GNN selection
(RG-Select), a framework for GNN reproducibility assessment via the
quantification of the most discriminative features (i.e., biomarkers) shared
between different models. To ascertain the soundness of our framework, the
reproducibility assessment embraces variations of different factors such as
training strategies and data perturbations. Despite these challenges, our
framework successfully yielded replicable conclusions across different training
strategies and various clinical datasets. Our findings could thus pave the way
for the development of biomarker trustworthiness and reliability assessment
methods for computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis tasks. RG-Select code is

                    <span>How data is represented and operationalized is critical for building
computational solutions that are both effective and efficient. A common
approach is to represent data objects as binary vectors, denoted \textit{hash
codes}, which require little storage and enable efficient similarity search
through direct indexing into a hash table or through similarity computations in
an appropriate space. Due to the limited expressibility of hash codes, compared
to real-valued representations, a core open challenge is how to generate hash
codes that well capture semantic content or latent properties using a small
number of bits, while ensuring that the hash codes are distributed in a way
that does not reduce their search efficiency. State of the art methods use
representation learning for generating such hash codes, focusing on neural
autoencoder architectures where semantics are encoded into the hash codes by
learning to reconstruct the original inputs of the hash codes. This thesis
addresses the above challenge and makes a number of contributions to
representation learning that (i) improve effectiveness of hash codes through
more expressive representations and a more effective similarity measure than
the current state of the art, namely the Hamming distance, and (ii) improve
efficiency of hash codes by learning representations that are especially suited
to the choice of search method. The contributions are empirically validated on
several tasks related to similarity search and recommendation.</span>

                    <span>Masked language modeling (MLM) is one of the key sub-tasks in vision-language
pretraining. In the cross-modal setting, tokens in the sentence are masked at
random, and the model predicts the masked tokens given the image and the text.
In this paper, we observe several key disadvantages of MLM in this setting.
First, as captions tend to be short, in a third of the sentences no token is
sampled. Second, the majority of masked tokens are stop-words and punctuation,
leading to under-utilization of the image. We investigate a range of
alternative masking strategies specific to the cross-modal setting that address
these shortcomings, aiming for better fusion of text and image in the learned
representation. When pre-training the LXMERT model, our alternative masking
strategies consistently improve over the original masking strategy on three
downstream tasks, especially in low resource settings. Further, our
pre-training approach substantially outperforms the baseline model on a
prompt-based probing task designed to elicit image objects. These results and
our analysis indicate that our method allows for better utilization of the
training data.</span>

Key to our approach is the use of a neural implicit representation that learns
to capture the 3D occupancy, radiance, and dynamics of the scene. By enforcing
consistency across different modalities, our representation enables multi-view
rendering in diverse dynamic scenes, including water pouring, robotic
interaction, and real images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods for
spatial-temporal view synthesis. Our approach works even when inputs images are

                    <span>Plant water stress may occur due to the limited availability of water to the
roots/soil or due to increased transpiration. These factors adversely affect
plant physiology and photosynthetic ability to the extent that it has been
shown to have inhibitory effects in both growth and yield [18]. Early
identification of plant water stress status enables suitable corrective
measures to be applied to obtain the expected crop yield. Further, improving
crop yield through precision agriculture methods is a key component of climate
policy and the UN sustainable development goals [1]. Leaf water content (LWC)
is a measure that can be used to estimate water content and identify stressed
plants. LWC during the early crop growth stages is an important indicator of
plant productivity and yield. The effect of water stress can be instantaneous
[15], affecting gaseous exchange or long-term, significantly reducing [9, 18,
22]. It is thus necessary to identify potential plant water stress during the
early stages of growth [15] to introduce corrective irrigation and alleviate
stress. LWC is also useful for identifying plant genotypes that are tolerant to
water stress and salinity by measuring the stability of LWC even under
artificially induced water stress [18, 25]. Such experiments generally employ
destructive procedures to obtain the LWC, which is time-consuming and labor
intensive. Accordingly, this research has developed a non-destructive method to
estimate LWC from UAV-based hyperspectral data.</span>

                    <span>In federated learning (FL), reducing the communication overhead is one of the
most critical challenges since the parameter server and the mobile devices
share the training parameters over wireless links. With such consideration, we
adopt the idea of SignSGD in which only the signs of the gradients are
exchanged. Moreover, most of the existing works assume Channel State
Information (CSI) available at both the mobile devices and the parameter
server, and thus the mobile devices can adopt fixed transmission rates dictated
by the channel capacity. In this work, only the parameter server side CSI is
assumed, and channel capacity with outage is considered. In this case, an
essential problem for the mobile devices is to select appropriate local
processing and communication parameters (including the transmission rates) to
achieve a desired balance between the overall learning performance and their
energy consumption. Two optimization problems are formulated and solved, which
optimize the learning performance given the energy consumption requirement, and
vice versa. Furthermore, considering that the data may be distributed across
the mobile devices in a highly uneven fashion in FL, a stochastic sign-based
algorithm is proposed. Extensive simulations are performed to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed methods.</span>

incorporate explainability features in AI systems, how to address real-world
user needs for understanding AI remains an open question. By interviewing 20 UX
and design practitioners working on various AI products, we seek to identify
gaps between the current XAI algorithmic work and practices to create
explainable AI products. To do so, we develop an algorithm-informed XAI
question bank in which user needs for explainability are represented as
prototypical questions users might ask about the AI, and use it as a study
probe. Our work contributes insights into the design space of XAI, informs
efforts to support design practices in this space, and identifies opportunities
for future XAI work. We also provide an extended XAI question bank and discuss

                    <span>Cutting plane methods play a significant role in modern solvers for tackling
mixed-integer programming (MIP) problems. Proper selection of cuts would remove
infeasible solutions in the early stage, thus largely reducing the
computational burden without hurting the solution accuracy. However, the major
cut selection approaches heavily rely on heuristics, which strongly depend on
the specific problem at hand and thus limit their generalization capability. In
this paper, we propose a data-driven and generalizable cut selection approach,
named Cut Ranking, in the settings of multiple instance learning. To measure
the quality of the candidate cuts, a scoring function, which takes the
instance-specific cut features as inputs, is trained and applied in cut ranking
and selection. In order to evaluate our method, we conduct extensive
experiments on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets. Compared with
commonly used heuristics for cut selection, the learning-based policy has shown
to be more effective, and is capable of generalizing over multiple problems
with different properties. Cut Ranking has been deployed in an industrial
solver for large-scale MIPs. In the online A/B testing of the product planning
problems with more than $10^7$ variables and constraints daily, Cut Ranking has
achieved the average speedup ratio of 12.42% over the production solver without
any accuracy loss of solution.</span>

                    <span>We examine the long-run behavior of multi-agent online learning in games that
evolve over time. Specifically, we focus on a wide class of policies based on
mirror descent, and we show that the induced sequence of play (a) converges to
Nash equilibrium in time-varying games that stabilize in the long run to a
strictly monotone limit; and (b) it stays asymptotically close to the evolving
equilibrium of the sequence of stage games (assuming they are strongly
monotone). Our results apply to both gradient-based and payoff-based feedback -
i.e., the &quot;bandit feedback&quot; case where players only get to observe the payoffs
of their chosen actions.</span>

                    <span>This paper considers joint analysis of multiple functionally related
structures in classification tasks. In particular, our method developed is
driven by how functionally correlated brain structures vary together between
autism and control groups. To do so, we devised a method based on a novel
combination of (1) non-Euclidean statistics that can faithfully represent
non-Euclidean data in Euclidean spaces and (2) a non-parametric integrative
analysis method that can decompose multi-block Euclidean data into joint,
individual, and residual structures. We find that the resulting joint structure
is effective, robust, and interpretable in recognizing the underlying patterns
of the joint variation of multi-block non-Euclidean data. We verified the
method in classifying the structural shape data collected from cases that
developed and did not develop into Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD).</span>

                    <span>The use of mobiles phones when driving have been a major factor when it comes
to road traffic incidents and the process of capturing such violations can be a
laborious task. Advancements in both modern object detection frameworks and
high-performance hardware has paved the way for a more automated approach when
it comes to video surveillance. In this work, we propose a custom-trained
state-of-the-art object detector to work with roadside cameras to capture
driver phone usage without the need for human intervention. The proposed
approach also addresses the issues caused by windscreen glare and introduces
the steps required to remedy this. Twelve pre-trained models are fine-tuned
with our custom dataset using four popular object detection methods: YOLO, SSD,
Faster R-CNN, and CenterNet. Out of all the object detectors tested, the YOLO
yields the highest accuracy levels of up to 96% (AP10) and frame rates of up to
~30 FPS. DeepSort object tracking algorithm is also integrated into the
best-performing model to collect records of only the unique violations, and
enable the proposed approach to count the number of vehicles. The proposed
automated system will collect the output images of the identified violations,
timestamps of each violation, and total vehicle count. Data can be accessed via
a purpose-built user interface.</span>

                    <span>A recent work from Bello shows that training and scaling strategies may be
more significant than model architectures for visual recognition. This short
note studies effective training and scaling strategies for video recognition
models. We propose a simple scaling strategy for 3D ResNets, in combination
with improved training strategies and minor architectural changes. The
resulting models, termed 3D ResNet-RS, attain competitive performance of 81.0
on Kinetics-400 and 83.8 on Kinetics-600 without pre-training. When pre-trained
on a large Web Video Text dataset, our best model achieves 83.5 and 84.3 on
Kinetics-400 and Kinetics-600. The proposed scaling rule is further evaluated
in a self-supervised setup using contrastive learning, demonstrating improved
performance. Code is available at:

Assistant process every utterance using multiple models for domain, intent and

domain classification errors using offline Transformer models. We combine
utterance encodings from a RoBERTa model with the Nbest hypothesis produced by
the production system. We then fine-tune end-to-end in a multitask setting
using a small dataset of humanannotated utterances with domain classification

                    <span>In this work, we propose to train a graph neural network via resampling from
a graphon estimate obtained from the underlying network data. More
specifically, the graphon or the link probability matrix of the underlying
network is first obtained from which a new network will be resampled and used
during the training process at each layer. Due to the uncertainty induced from
the resampling, it helps mitigate the well-known issue of over-smoothing in a
graph neural network (GNN) model. Our framework is general, computationally
efficient, and conceptually simple. Another appealing feature of our method is
that it requires minimal additional tuning during the training process.
Extensive numerical results show that our approach is competitive with and in
many cases outperform the other over-smoothing reducing GNN training methods.</span>

                    <span>Autonomous vehicles must reason about spatial occlusions in urban
environments to ensure safety without being overly cautious. Prior work
explored occlusion inference from observed social behaviors of road agents.
Inferring occupancy from agent behaviors is an inherently multimodal problem; a
driver may behave in the same manner for different occupancy patterns ahead of
them (e.g., a driver may move at constant speed in traffic or on an open road).
Past work, however, does not account for this multimodality, thus neglecting to
model this source of aleatoric uncertainty in the relationship between driver
behaviors and their environment. We propose an occlusion inference method that
characterizes observed behaviors of human agents as sensor measurements, and
fuses them with those from a standard sensor suite. To capture the aleatoric
uncertainty, we train a conditional variational autoencoder with a discrete
latent space to learn a multimodal mapping from observed driver trajectories to
an occupancy grid representation of the view ahead of the driver. Our method
handles multi-agent scenarios, combining measurements from multiple observed
drivers using evidential theory to solve the sensor fusion problem. Our
approach is validated on a real-world dataset, outperforming baselines and
demonstrating real-time capable performance. Our code is available at

                    <span>We propose CX-ToM, short for counterfactual explanations with theory-of mind,
a new explainable AI (XAI) framework for explaining decisions made by a deep
convolutional neural network (CNN). In contrast to the current methods in XAI
that generate explanations as a single shot response, we pose explanation as an
iterative communication process, i.e. dialog, between the machine and human
user. More concretely, our CX-ToM framework generates sequence of explanations
in a dialog by mediating the differences between the minds of machine and human
user. To do this, we use Theory of Mind (ToM) which helps us in explicitly
modeling human&#x27;s intention, machine&#x27;s mind as inferred by the human as well as
human&#x27;s mind as inferred by the machine. Moreover, most state-of-the-art XAI
frameworks provide attention (or heat map) based explanations. In our work, we
show that these attention based explanations are not sufficient for increasing
human trust in the underlying CNN model. In CX-ToM, we instead use
counterfactual explanations called fault-lines which we define as follows:
given an input image I for which a CNN classification model M predicts class
c_pred, a fault-line identifies the minimal semantic-level features (e.g.,
stripes on zebra, pointed ears of dog), referred to as explainable concepts,
that need to be added to or deleted from I in order to alter the classification
category of I by M to another specified class c_alt. We argue that, due to the
iterative, conceptual and counterfactual nature of CX-ToM explanations, our
framework is practical and more natural for both expert and non-expert users to
understand the internal workings of complex deep learning models. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments verify our hypotheses, demonstrating
that our CX-ToM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art explainable AI
models.</span>

                    <span>Convolution neural networks have been successful in solving many socially
important and economically significant problems. Their ability to learn complex
high-dimensional functions hierarchically can be attributed to the use of
nonlinear activation functions. A key discovery that made training deep
networks feasible was the adoption of the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
activation function to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem caused by using
saturating activation functions. Since then many improved variants of the ReLU
activation have been proposed. However a majority of activation functions used
today are non-oscillatory and monotonically increasing due to their biological
plausibility. This paper demonstrates that oscillatory activation functions can
improve gradient flow and reduce network size. It is shown that oscillatory
activation functions allow neurons to switch classification (sign of output)
within the interior of neuronal hyperplane positive and negative half-spaces
allowing complex decisions with fewer neurons. A new oscillatory activation
function C(z) &#x3D; z cos z that outperforms Sigmoids, Swish, Mish and ReLU on a
variety of architectures and benchmarks is presented. This new activation
function allows even single neurons to exhibit nonlinear decision boundaries.
This paper presents a single neuron solution to the famous XOR problem.
Experimental results indicate that replacing the activation function in the
convolutional layers with C(z) significantly improves performance on CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100 and Imagenette.</span>

                    <span>Reinforcement learning has been found useful in solving optimal power flow
(OPF) problems in electric power distribution systems. However, the use of
largely model-free reinforcement learning algorithms that completely ignore the
physics-based modeling of the power grid compromises the optimizer performance
and poses scalability challenges. This paper proposes a novel approach to
synergistically combine the physics-based models with learning-based algorithms
using imitation learning to solve distribution-level OPF problems.
Specifically, we propose imitation learning based improvements in deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) methods to solve the OPF problem for a specific
case of battery storage dispatch in the power distribution systems. The
proposed imitation learning algorithm uses the approximate optimal solutions
obtained from a linearized model-based OPF solver to provide a good initial
policy for the DRL algorithms while improving the training efficiency. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using IEEE 34-bus and
123-bus distribution feeders with numerous distribution-level battery storage
systems.</span>

available that assess data quality with respect to general cleaning and
profiling checks. However these techniques are not applicable to detect data
issues in the context of machine learning tasks, like noisy labels, existence

streamline the data quality assessment process. Our toolkit is publicly

                    <span>Multi-variate time series (MTS) data is a ubiquitous class of data
abstraction in the real world. Any instance of MTS is generated from a hybrid
dynamical system and their specific dynamics are usually unknown. The hybrid
nature of such a dynamical system is a result of complex external attributes,
such as geographic location and time of day, each of which can be categorized
into either spatial attributes or temporal attributes. Therefore, there are two
fundamental views which can be used to analyze MTS data, namely the spatial
view and the temporal view. Moreover, from each of these two views, we can
partition the set of data samples of MTS into disjoint forecasting tasks in
accordance with their associated attribute values. Then, samples of the same
task will manifest similar forthcoming pattern, which is less sophisticated to
be predicted in comparison with the original single-view setting. Considering
this insight, we propose a novel multi-view multi-task (MVMT) learning
framework for MTS forecasting. Instead of being explicitly presented in most
scenarios, MVMT information is deeply concealed in the MTS data, which severely
hinders the model from capturing it naturally. To this end, we develop two
kinds of basic operations, namely task-wise affine transformation and task-wise
normalization, respectively. Applying these two operations with prior knowledge
on the spatial and temporal view allows the model to adaptively extract MVMT
information while predicting. Extensive experiments on three datasets are
conducted to illustrate that canonical architectures can be greatly enhanced by
the MVMT learning framework in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. In
addition, we design rich case studies to reveal the properties of
representations produced at different phases in the entire prediction
procedure.</span>

                    <span>Linguistic entrainment is a phenomenon where people tend to mimic each other
in conversation. The core instrument to quantify entrainment is a linguistic
similarity measure between conversational partners. Most of the current
similarity measures are based on bag-of-words approaches that rely on
linguistic markers, ignoring the overall language structure and dialogue
context. To address this issue, we propose to use a neural network model to
perform the similarity measure for entrainment. Our model is context-aware, and
it further leverages a novel component to learn the shared high-level
linguistic features across dialogues. We first investigate the effectiveness of
our novel component. Then we use the model to perform similarity measure in a
corpus-based entrainment analysis. We observe promising results for both
evaluation tasks.</span>

                    <span>Recent studies on the memorization effects of deep neural networks on noisy
labels show that the networks first fit the correctly-labeled training samples
before memorizing the mislabeled samples. Motivated by this early-learning
phenomenon, we propose a novel method to prevent memorization of the mislabeled
samples. Unlike the existing approaches which use the model output to identify
or ignore the mislabeled samples, we introduce an indicator branch to the
original model and enable the model to produce a confidence value for each
sample. The confidence values are incorporated in our loss function which is
learned to assign large confidence values to correctly-labeled samples and
small confidence values to mislabeled samples. We also propose an auxiliary
regularization term to further improve the robustness of the model. To improve
the performance, we gradually correct the noisy labels with a well-designed
target estimation strategy. We provide the theoretical analysis and conduct the
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that our
approach achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>Growing use of machine learning in policy and social impact settings have
raised concerns for fairness implications, especially for racial minorities.
These concerns have generated considerable interest among machine learning and
artificial intelligence researchers, who have developed new methods and
established theoretical bounds for improving fairness, focusing on the source
data, regularization and model training, or post-hoc adjustments to model
scores. However, little work has studied the practical trade-offs between
fairness and accuracy in real-world settings to understand how these bounds and
methods translate into policy choices and impact on society. Our empirical
study fills this gap by investigating the impact of mitigating disparities on
accuracy, focusing on the common context of using machine learning to inform
benefit allocation in resource-constrained programs across education, mental
health, criminal justice, and housing safety. Here we describe applied work in
which we find fairness-accuracy trade-offs to be negligible in practice. In
each setting studied, explicitly focusing on achieving equity and using our
proposed post-hoc disparity mitigation methods, fairness was substantially
improved without sacrificing accuracy. This observation was robust across
policy contexts studied, scale of resources available for intervention, time,
and relative size of the protected groups. These empirical results challenge a
commonly held assumption that reducing disparities either requires accepting an
appreciable drop in accuracy or the development of novel, complex methods,
making reducing disparities in these applications more practical.</span>

                    <span>Several scalable sample-based methods to compute the Kullback Leibler (KL)
divergence between two distributions have been proposed and applied in
large-scale machine learning models. While they have been found to be unstable,
the theoretical root cause of the problem is not clear. In this paper, we study
a generative adversarial network based approach that uses a neural network
discriminator to estimate KL divergence. We argue that, in such case, high
fluctuations in the estimates are a consequence of not controlling the
complexity of the discriminator function space. We provide a theoretical
underpinning and remedy for this problem by first constructing a discriminator
in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). This enables us to leverage
sample complexity and mean embedding to theoretically relate the error
probability bound of the KL estimates to the complexity of the discriminator in
RKHS. Based on this theory, we then present a scalable way to control the
complexity of the discriminator for a reliable estimation of KL divergence. We
support both our proposed theory and method to control the complexity of the
RKHS discriminator through controlled experiments.</span>

                    <span>Online continual learning for image classification studies the problem of
learning to classify images from an online stream of data and tasks, where
tasks may include new classes (class incremental) or data nonstationarity
(domain incremental). One of the key challenges of continual learning is to
avoid catastrophic forgetting (CF), i.e., forgetting old tasks in the presence
of more recent tasks. Over the past few years, many methods and tricks have
been introduced to address this problem, but many have not been fairly and
systematically compared under a variety of realistic and practical settings. To
better understand the relative advantages of various approaches and the
settings where they work best, this survey aims to (1) compare state-of-the-art
methods such as MIR, iCARL, and GDumb and determine which works best at
different experimental settings; (2) determine if the best class incremental
methods are also competitive in domain incremental setting; (3) evaluate the
performance of 7 simple but effective trick such as &quot;review&quot; trick and nearest
class mean (NCM) classifier to assess their relative impact. Regarding (1), we
observe iCaRL remains competitive when the memory buffer is small; GDumb
outperforms many recently proposed methods in medium-size datasets and MIR
performs the best in larger-scale datasets. For (2), we note that GDumb
performs quite poorly while MIR -- already competitive for (1) -- is also
strongly competitive in this very different but important setting. Overall,
this allows us to conclude that MIR is overall a strong and versatile method
across a wide variety of settings. For (3), we find that all 7 tricks are
beneficial, and when augmented with the &quot;review&quot; trick and NCM classifier, MIR
produces performance levels that bring online continual learning much closer to
its ultimate goal of matching offline training.</span>

                    <span>A profound shift in the study of cosmology came with the discovery of
thousands of exoplanets and the possibility of the existence of billions of
them in our Galaxy. The biggest goal in these searches is whether there are
other life-harbouring planets. However, the question which of these detected
planets are habitable, potentially-habitable, or maybe even inhabited, is still
not answered. Some potentially habitable exoplanets have been hypothesized, but
since Earth is the only known habitable planet, measures of habitability are
necessarily determined with Earth as the reference. Several recent works
introduced new habitability metrics based on optimization methods.
Classification of potentially habitable exoplanets using supervised learning is
another emerging area of study. However, both modeling and supervised learning
approaches suffer from drawbacks. We propose an anomaly detection method, the
Multi-Stage Memetic Algorithm (MSMA), to detect anomalies and extend it to an
unsupervised clustering algorithm MSMVMCA to use it to detect potentially
habitable exoplanets as anomalies. The algorithm is based on the postulate that
Earth is an anomaly, with the possibility of existence of few other anomalies
among thousands of data points. We describe an MSMA-based clustering approach
with a novel distance function to detect habitable candidates as anomalies
(including Earth). The results are cross-matched with the habitable exoplanet
catalog (PHL-HEC) of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory (PHL) with both
optimistic and conservative lists of potentially habitable exoplanets.</span>

                    <span>Objective: To propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) architecture -- the
filter bank convolutional neural network (FBCNN) -- to improve SSVEP
classification in single-channel BCIs with small data lengths.

Methods: We propose two models: the FBCNN-2D and the FBCNN-3D. The FBCNN-2D
utilizes a filter bank to create sub-band components of the
electroencephalography (EEG) signal, which it transforms using the fast Fourier
transform (FFT) and analyzes with a 2D CNN. The FBCNN-3D utilizes the same
filter bank, but it transforms the sub-band components into spectrograms via
short-time Fourier transform (STFT), and analyzes them with a 3D CNN. We made
use of transfer learning. To train the FBCNN-3D, we proposed a new technique,
called inter-dimensional transfer learning, to transfer knowledge from a 2D DNN
to a 3D DNN. Our BCI was conceived so as not to require calibration from the
final user: therefore, the test subject data was separated from training and
validation.

Results: The mean test accuracy was 85.7% for the FBCCA-2D and 85% for the
FBCCA-3D. Mean F1-Scores were 0.858 and 0.853. Alternative classification
methods, SVM, FBCCA and a CNN, had mean accuracy of 79.2%, 80.1% and 81.4%,
respectively.

Conclusion: The FBCNNs surpassed traditional SSVEP classification methods in
our simulated BCI, by a considerable margin (about 5% higher accuracy).
Transfer learning and inter-dimensional transfer learning made training much
faster and more predictable.

Significance: We proposed a new and flexible type of DNN, which had a better
performance than standard methods in SSVEP classification for portable and fast
BCIs.</span>

                    <span>Adversarial attacks have been expanded to speaker recognition (SR). However,
existing attacks are often assessed using different SR models, recognition
tasks and datasets, and only few adversarial defenses borrowed from computer
vision are considered. Yet,these defenses have not been thoroughly evaluated
against adaptive attacks. Thus, there is still a lack of quantitative
understanding about the strengths and limitations of adversarial attacks and
defenses. More effective defenses are also required for securing SR systems. To
bridge this gap, we present SEC4SR, the first platform enabling researchers to
systematically and comprehensively evaluate adversarial attacks and defenses in
SR. SEC4SR incorporates 4 white-box and 2 black-box attacks, 24 defenses
including our novel feature-level transformations. It also contains techniques
for mounting adaptive attacks. Using SEC4SR, we conduct thus far the
largest-scale empirical study on adversarial attacks and defenses in SR,
involving 23 defenses, 15 attacks and 4 attack settings. Our study provides
lots of useful findings that may advance future research: such as (1) all the
transformations slightly degrade accuracy on benign examples and their
effectiveness vary with attacks; (2) most transformations become less effective
under adaptive attacks, but some transformations become more effective; (3) few
transformations combined with adversarial training yield stronger defenses over
some but not all attacks, while our feature-level transformation combined with
adversarial training yields the strongest defense over all the attacks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate capabilities and advantages of SEC4SR which
can benefit future research in SR.</span>

writer-labelled messages. We design a benchmark and evaluate several feature
spaces and learning algorithms, including two simple yet novel models on top of

                    <span>Koopman spectral theory has provided a new perspective in the field of
dynamical systems in recent years. Modern dynamical systems are becoming
increasingly non-linear and complex, and there is a need for a framework to
model these systems in a compact and comprehensive representation for
prediction and control. The central problem in applying Koopman theory to a
system of interest is that the choice of finite-dimensional basis functions is
typically done apriori, using expert knowledge of the systems dynamics. Our
approach learns these basis functions using a supervised learning approach
where a combination of autoencoders and deep neural networks learn the basis
functions for any given system. We demonstrate this approach on a simple
pendulum example in which we obtain a linear representation of the non-linear
system and then predict the future state trajectories given some initial
conditions. We also explore how changing the input representation of the
dynamic systems time series data can impact the quality of learned basis
functions. This alternative representation is compared to the traditional raw
time series data approach to determine which method results in lower
reconstruction and prediction error of the true non-linear dynamics of the
system.</span>

                    <span>The task of learning from only a few examples (called a few-shot setting) is
of key importance and relevance to a real-world setting. For question answering
(QA), the current state-of-the-art pre-trained models typically need
fine-tuning on tens of thousands of examples to obtain good results. Their
performance degrades significantly in a few-shot setting (&lt; 100 examples). To
address this, we propose a simple fine-tuning framework that leverages
pre-trained text-to-text models and is directly aligned with their pre-training
framework. Specifically, we construct the input as a concatenation of the
question, a mask token representing the answer span and a context. Given this
input, the model is fine-tuned using the same objective as that of its
pre-training objective. Through experimental studies on various few-shot
configurations, we show that this formulation leads to significant gains on
multiple QA benchmarks (an absolute gain of 34.2 F1 points on average when
there are only 16 training examples). The gains extend further when used with
larger models (Eg:- 72.3 F1 on SQuAD using BART-large with only 32 examples)
and translate well to a multilingual setting . On the multilingual TydiQA
benchmark, our model outperforms the XLM-Roberta-large by an absolute margin of
upto 40 F1 points and an average of 33 F1 points in a few-shot setting (&lt;&#x3D; 64
training examples). We conduct detailed ablation studies to analyze factors
contributing to these gains.</span>

                    <span>Firms earning prediction plays a vital role in investment decisions,
dividends expectation, and share price. It often involves multiple
tensor-compatible datasets with non-linear multi-way relationships,
spatiotemporal structures, and different levels of sparsity. Current non-linear
tensor completion algorithms tend to learn noisy embedding and incur
overfitting. This paper focuses on the embedding learning aspect of the tensor
completion problem and proposes a new multi-layer neural network architecture
for tensor factorization and completion (MLCTR). The network architecture
entails multiple advantages: a series of low-rank matrix factorizations (MF)
building blocks to minimize overfitting, interleaved transfer functions in each
layer for non-linearity, and by-pass connections to reduce the gradient
diminishing problem and increase the depths of neural networks. Furthermore,
the model employs Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) based optimization for fast
convergence in training. Our algorithm is highly efficient for imputing missing
values in the EPS data. Experiments confirm that our strategy of incorporating
non-linearity in factor matrices demonstrates impressive performance in
embedding learning and end-to-end tensor models, and outperforms approaches
with non-linearity in the phase of reconstructing tensors from factor matrices.</span>

                    <span>For the Domain Generalization (DG) problem where the hypotheses are composed
of a common representation function followed by a labeling function, we point
out a shortcoming in existing approaches that fail to explicitly optimize for a
term, appearing in a well-known and widely adopted upper bound to the risk on
the unseen domain, that is dependent on the representation to be learned. To
this end, we first derive a novel upper bound to the prediction risk. We show
that imposing a mild assumption on the representation to be learned, namely
manifold restricted invertibility, is sufficient to deal with this issue.
Further, unlike existing approaches, our novel upper bound doesn&#x27;t require the
assumption of Lipschitzness of the loss function. In addition, the
distributional discrepancy in the representation space is handled via the
Wasserstein-2 barycenter cost. In this context, we creatively leverage old and
recent transport inequalities, which link various optimal transport metrics, in
particular the $L^1$ distance (also known as the total variation distance) and
the Wasserstein-2 distances, with the Kullback-Liebler divergence. These
analyses and insights motivate a new representation learning cost for DG that
additively balances three competing objectives: 1) minimizing classification
error across seen domains via cross-entropy, 2) enforcing domain-invariance in
the representation space via the Wasserstein-2 barycenter cost, and 3)
promoting non-degenerate, nearly-invertible representation via one of two
mechanisms, viz., an autoencoder-based reconstruction loss or a mutual
information loss. It is to be noted that the proposed algorithms completely
bypass the use of any adversarial training mechanism that is typical of many
current domain generalization approaches. Simulation results on several
standard datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to several
well-known DG algorithms.</span>

                    <span>Modern GPU datacenters are critical for delivering Deep Learning (DL) models
and services in both the research community and industry. When operating a
datacenter, optimization of resource scheduling and management can bring
significant financial benefits. Achieving this goal requires a deep
understanding of the job features and user behaviors. We present a
comprehensive study about the characteristics of DL jobs and resource
management. First, we perform a large-scale analysis of real-world job traces
from SenseTime. We uncover some interesting conclusions from the perspectives
of clusters, jobs and users, which can facilitate the cluster system designs.
Second, we introduce a general-purpose framework, which manages resources based
on historical data. As case studies, we design: a Quasi-Shortest-Service-First
scheduling service, which can minimize the cluster-wide average job completion
time by up to 6.5x; and a Cluster Energy Saving service, which improves overall
cluster utilization by up to 13%.</span>

                    <span>Temporal set prediction is becoming increasingly important as many companies
employ recommender systems in their online businesses, e.g., personalized
purchase prediction of shopping baskets. While most previous techniques have
focused on leveraging a user&#x27;s history, the study of combining it with others&#x27;
histories remains untapped potential. This paper proposes Global-Local Item
Embedding (GLOIE) that learns to utilize the temporal properties of sets across
whole users as well as within a user by coining the names as global and local
information to distinguish the two temporal patterns. GLOIE uses Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) and dynamic graph-based model to capture global and local
information and then applies attention to integrate resulting item embeddings.
Additionally, we propose to use Tweedie output for the decoder of VAE as it can
easily model zero-inflated and long-tailed distribution, which is more suitable
for several real-world data distributions than Gaussian or multinomial
counterparts. When evaluated on three public benchmarks, our algorithm
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in most ranking
metrics.</span>

                    <span>The classical development of neural networks has primarily focused on
learning mappings between finite dimensional Euclidean spaces or finite sets.
We propose a generalization of neural networks tailored to learn operators
mapping between infinite dimensional function spaces. We formulate the
approximation of operators by composition of a class of linear integral
operators and nonlinear activation functions, so that the composed operator can
approximate complex nonlinear operators. We prove a universal approximation
theorem for our construction. Furthermore, we introduce four classes of
operator parameterizations: graph-based operators, low-rank operators,
multipole graph-based operators, and Fourier operators and describe efficient
algorithms for computing with each one. The proposed neural operators are
resolution-invariant: they share the same network parameters between different
discretizations of the underlying function spaces and can be used for zero-shot
super-resolutions. Numerically, the proposed models show superior performance
compared to existing machine learning based methodologies on Burgers&#x27; equation,
Darcy flow, and the Navier-Stokes equation, while being several order of
magnitude faster compared to conventional PDE solvers.</span>

                    <span>The rapid recent progress in machine learning (ML) has raised a number of
scientific questions that challenge the longstanding dogma of the field. One of
the most important riddles is the good empirical generalization of
overparameterized models. Overparameterized models are excessively complex with
respect to the size of the training dataset, which results in them perfectly
fitting (i.e., interpolating) the training data, which is usually noisy. Such
interpolation of noisy data is traditionally associated with detrimental
overfitting, and yet a wide range of interpolating models -- from simple linear
models to deep neural networks -- have recently been observed to generalize
extremely well on fresh test data. Indeed, the recently discovered double
descent phenomenon has revealed that highly overparameterized models often
improve over the best underparameterized model in test performance.

Understanding learning in this overparameterized regime requires new theory
and foundational empirical studies, even for the simplest case of the linear
model. The underpinnings of this understanding have been laid in very recent
analyses of overparameterized linear regression and related statistical
learning tasks, which resulted in precise analytic characterizations of double
descent. This paper provides a succinct overview of this emerging theory of
overparameterized ML (henceforth abbreviated as TOPML) that explains these
recent findings through a statistical signal processing perspective. We
emphasize the unique aspects that define the TOPML research area as a subfield
of modern ML theory and outline interesting open questions that remain.</span>

                    <span>It is notoriously difficult to control the behavior of reinforcement learning
agents. Agents often learn to exploit the environment or reward signal and need
to be retrained multiple times. The multi-objective reinforcement learning
(MORL) framework separates a reward function into several objectives. An ideal
MORL agent learns to generalize to novel combinations of objectives allowing
for better control of an agent&#x27;s behavior without requiring retraining. Many
MORL approaches use a weight vector to parameterize the importance of each
objective. However, this approach suffers from lack of expressiveness and
interpretability. We propose using propositional logic to specify the
importance of multiple objectives. By using a logic where predicates correspond
directly to objectives, specifications are inherently more interpretable.
Additionally the set of specifications that can be expressed with formal
languages is a superset of what can be expressed by weight vectors. In this
paper, we define a formal language based on propositional logic with
quantitative semantics. We encode logical specifications using a recurrent
neural network and show that MORL agents parameterized by these encodings are
able to generalize to novel specifications over objectives and achieve
performance comparable to single objective baselines.</span>

                    <span>Learning general-purpose representations from multisensor data produced by
the omnipresent sensing systems (or IoT in general) has numerous applications
in diverse use cases. Existing purely supervised end-to-end deep learning
techniques depend on the availability of a massive amount of well-curated data,
acquiring which is notoriously difficult but required to achieve a sufficient
level of generalization on a task of interest. In this work, we leverage the
self-supervised learning paradigm towards realizing the vision of continual
learning from unlabeled inputs. We present a generalized framework named Sense
and Learn for representation or feature learning from raw sensory data. It
consists of several auxiliary tasks that can learn high-level and broadly
useful features entirely from unannotated data without any human involvement in
the tedious labeling process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on
several publicly available datasets from different domains and in various
settings, including linear separability, semi-supervised or few shot learning,
and transfer learning. Our methodology achieves results that are competitive
with the supervised approaches and close the gap through fine-tuning a network
while learning the downstream tasks in most cases. In particular, we show that
the self-supervised network can be utilized as initialization to significantly
boost the performance in a low-data regime with as few as 5 labeled instances
per class, which is of high practical importance to real-world problems.
Likewise, the learned representations with self-supervision are found to be
highly transferable between related datasets, even when few labeled instances
are available from the target domains. The self-learning nature of our
methodology opens up exciting possibilities for on-device continual learning.</span>

                    <span>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have enjoyed tremendous success in
image generation and processing, and have recently attracted growing interests
in financial modelings. This paper analyzes GANs from the perspectives of
mean-field games (MFGs) and optimal transport. More specifically, from the game
theoretical perspective, GANs are interpreted as MFGs under Pareto Optimality
criterion or mean-field controls; from the optimal transport perspective, GANs
are to minimize the optimal transport cost indexed by the generator from the
known latent distribution to the unknown true distribution of data. The MFGs
perspective of GANs leads to a GAN-based computational method (MFGANs) to solve
MFGs: one neural network for the backward Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and
one neural network for the forward Fokker-Planck equation, with the two neural
networks trained in an adversarial way. Numerical experiments demonstrate
superior performance of this proposed algorithm, especially in the higher
dimensional case, when compared with existing neural network approaches.</span>

lots of attention, lack of such community resources severely limits scientific
progress. In this paper, we present Exathlon, the first comprehensive public
benchmark for explainable anomaly detection over high-dimensional time series

from repeated executions of large-scale stream processing jobs on an Apache
Spark cluster. Some of these executions were intentionally disturbed by
introducing instances of six different types of anomalous events (e.g.,
misbehaving inputs, resource contention, process failures). For each of the
anomaly instances, ground truth labels for the root cause interval as well as
those for the extended effect interval are provided, supporting the development
and evaluation of a wide range of anomaly detection (AD) and explanation

                    <span>Quantum Annealing (QA) was originally intended for accelerating the solution
of combinatorial optimization tasks that have natural encodings as Ising
models. However, recent experiments on QA hardware platforms have demonstrated
that, in the operating regime corresponding to weak interactions, the QA
hardware behaves like a noisy Gibbs sampler at a hardware-specific effective
temperature. This work builds on those insights and identifies a class of small
hardware-native Ising models that are robust to noise effects and proposes a
novel procedure for executing these models on QA hardware to maximize Gibbs
sampling performance. Experimental results indicate that the proposed protocol
results in high-quality Gibbs samples from a hardware-specific effective
temperature and that the QA annealing time can be used to adjust the effective
temperature of the output distribution. The procedure proposed in this work
provides a new approach to using QA hardware for Ising model sampling
presenting potential new opportunities for applications in machine learning and
physics simulation.</span>

object shapes and textures across a category and can be trained, from a set of
posed images, to synthesize novel views of unseen objects. Unlike the original
NeRF, which is scene specific, CodeNeRF learns to disentangle shape and texture
by learning separate embeddings. At test time, given a single unposed image of
an unseen object, CodeNeRF jointly estimates camera viewpoint, and shape and
appearance codes via optimization. Unseen objects can be reconstructed from a
single image, and then rendered from new viewpoints or their shape and texture
edited by varying the latent codes. We conduct experiments on the SRN
benchmark, which show that CodeNeRF generalises well to unseen objects and
achieves on-par performance with methods that require known camera pose at test
time. Our results on real-world images demonstrate that CodeNeRF can bridge the

software-intensive system development. With the increased usage of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) as part of such systems, this
becomes more difficult as well-understood software testing approaches cannot be
applied directly to the AI-enabled parts of the system. The required adaptation
of classical testing approaches and development of new concepts for AI would
benefit from a deeper understanding and exchange between AI and software
engineering experts. A major obstacle on this way, we see in the different
terminologies used in the two communities. As we consider a mutual
understanding of the testing terminology as a key, this paper contributes a

the metrics SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) and FAD (Frech\&#x27;et Audio
Distance). It was found that a many-to-many approach supersedes a one-to-one
approach in terms of reconstructive capabilities, and that the adoption of a
basic over a bottleneck residual block design is more suitable for enriching
content information about a latent space. It was also found that the decision
on whether cyclic loss takes on a variational autoencoder or vanilla
autoencoder approach does not have a significant impact on reconstructive and
adversarial translation aspects of the model.</span>

                    <span>For the high dimensional data representation, nonnegative tensor ring (NTR)
decomposition equipped with manifold learning has become a promising model to
exploit the multi-dimensional structure and extract the feature from tensor
data. However, the existing methods such as graph regularized tensor ring
decomposition (GNTR) only models the pair-wise similarities of objects. For
tensor data with complex manifold structure, the graph can not exactly
construct similarity relationships. In this paper, in order to effectively
utilize the higher-dimensional and complicated similarities among objects, we
introduce hypergraph to the framework of NTR to further enhance the feature
extraction, upon which a hypergraph regularized nonnegative tensor ring
decomposition (HGNTR) method is developed. To reduce the computational
complexity and suppress the noise, we apply the low-rank approximation trick to
accelerate HGNTR (called LraHGNTR). Our experimental results show that compared
with other state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed HGNTR and LraHGNTR can
achieve higher performance in clustering tasks, in addition, LraHGNTR can
greatly reduce running time without decreasing accuracy.</span>

                    <span>Communication has been seen as a significant bottleneck in industrial
applications over large-scale networks. To alleviate the communication burden,
sign-based optimization algorithms have gained popularity recently in both
industrial and academic communities, which is shown to be closely related to
adaptive gradient methods, such as Adam. Along this line, this paper
investigates faster convergence for a variant of sign-based gradient descent,
called scaled signGD, in three cases: 1) the objective function is strongly
convex; 2) the objective function is nonconvex but satisfies the
Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequality; 3) the gradient is stochastic, called
scaled signGD in this case. For the first two cases, it can be shown that the
scaled signGD converges at a linear rate. For case 3), the algorithm is shown
to converge linearly to a neighborhood of the optimal value when a constant
learning rate is employed, and the algorithm converges at a rate of $O(1/k)$
when using a diminishing learning rate, where $k$ is the iteration number. The
results are also extended to the distributed setting by majority vote in a
parameter-server framework. Finally, numerical experiments on logistic
regression are performed to corroborate the theoretical findings.</span>

                    <span>With AlphaGo defeats top human players, reinforcement learning(RL) algorithms
have gradually become the code-base of building stronger artificial
intelligence(AI). The RL algorithm design firstly needs to adapt to the
specific environment, so the designed environment guides the rapid and profound
development of RL algorithms. However, the existing environments, which can be
divided into real world games and customized toy environments, have obvious
shortcomings. For real world games, it is designed for human entertainment, and
too much difficult for most of RL researchers. For customized toy environments,
there is no widely accepted unified evaluation standard for all RL algorithms.
Therefore, we introduce the first virtual user-friendly environment framework
for RL. In this framework, the environment can be easily configured to realize
all kinds of RL tasks in the mainstream research. Then all the mainstream
state-of-the-art(SOTA) RL algorithms can be conveniently evaluated and
compared. Therefore, our contributions mainly includes the following aspects:
1.single configured environment for all classification of SOTA RL algorithms;
2.combined environment of more than one classification RL algorithms; 3.the
evaluation standard for all kinds of RL algorithms. With all these efforts, a
possibility for breeding an AI with capability of general competency in a
variety of tasks is provided, and maybe it will open up a new chapter for AI.</span>

                    <span>Catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge while learning new
tasks is a widely observed limitation of contemporary neural networks. Although
many continual learning methods are proposed to mitigate this drawback, the
main question remains unanswered: what is the root cause of catastrophic
forgetting? In this work, we aim at answering this question by posing and
validating a set of research hypotheses related to the specificity of
representations built internally by neural models. More specifically, we design
a set of empirical evaluations that compare the robustness of representations
in discriminative and generative models against catastrophic forgetting. We
observe that representations learned by discriminative models are more prone to
catastrophic forgetting than their generative counterparts, which sheds new
light on the advantages of developing generative models for continual learning.
Finally, our work opens new research pathways and possibilities to adopt
generative models in continual learning beyond mere replay mechanisms.</span>

                    <span>Risk management is critical in decision making, and mean-variance (MV)
trade-off is one of the most common criteria. However, in reinforcement
learning (RL) for sequential decision making under uncertainty, most of the
existing methods for MV control suffer from computational difficulties caused
by the double sampling problem. In this paper, in contrast to strict MV
control, we consider learning MV efficient policies that achieve Pareto
efficiency regarding MV trade-off. To achieve this purpose, we train an agent
to maximize the expected quadratic utility function, a common objective of risk
management in finance and economics. We call our approach direct expected
quadratic utility maximization (EQUM). The EQUM does not suffer from the double
sampling issue because it does not include gradient estimation of variance. We
confirm that the maximizer of the objective in the EQUM directly corresponds to
an MV efficient policy under a certain condition. We conduct experiments with
benchmark settings to demonstrate the effectiveness of the EQUM.</span>

                    <span>Variational Bayes (VB) is a popular scalable alternative to Markov chain
Monte Carlo for Bayesian inference. We study a mean-field spike and slab VB
approximation of widely used Bayesian model selection priors in sparse
high-dimensional logistic regression. We provide non-asymptotic theoretical
guarantees for the VB posterior in both $\ell_2$ and prediction loss for a
sparse truth, giving optimal (minimax) convergence rates. Since the VB
algorithm does not depend on the unknown truth to achieve optimality, our
results shed light on effective prior choices. We confirm the improved
performance of our VB algorithm over common sparse VB approaches in a numerical
study.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we consider the problem of training neural network (NN)
controllers for nonlinear dynamical systems that are guaranteed to satisfy
safety and liveness (e.g., reach-avoid) properties. Our approach is to combine
model-based design methodologies for dynamical systems with data-driven
approaches to achieve this target. We confine our attention to NNs with
Rectifier Linear Unit (ReLU) nonlinearity which are known to represent
Continuous Piece-Wise Affine (CPWA) functions. Given a mathematical model of
the dynamical system, we compute a finite-state abstract model that captures
the closed-loop behavior under all possible CPWA controllers. Using this
finite-state abstract model, our framework identifies a family of CPWA
functions guaranteed to satisfy the safety requirements. We augment the
learning algorithm with a NN weight projection operator during training that
enforces the resulting NN to represent a CPWA function from the provably safe
family of CPWA functions. Moreover, the proposed framework uses the
finite-state abstract model to identify candidate CPWA functions that may
satisfy the liveness properties. Using such candidate CPWA functions, the
proposed framework biases the NN training to achieve the liveness
specification. We show the efficacy of the proposed framework both in
simulation and on an actual robotic vehicle.</span>

envelope extraction, peak-burst detection and clustering in time series. Our
problem formalization results in a naturally defined splitting/forking of the
time series. With a possibly hierarchical implementation, it can be used for
various applications in machine learning, signal processing and mathematical
finance. From an incoming input signal, our iterative procedure sequentially
creates two signals (one upper bounding and one lower bounding signal) by
minimizing the cumulative $L_1$ drift. We show that a solution can be
efficiently calculated by use of a Viterbi-like path tracking algorithm
together with an optimal elimination rule. We consider many interesting
settings, where our algorithm has near-linear time complexities.</span>
