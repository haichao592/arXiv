                    <span>Data augmentation has recently seen increased interest in NLP due to more
work in low-resource domains, new tasks, and the popularity of large-scale
neural networks that require large amounts of training data. Despite this
recent upsurge, this area is still relatively underexplored, perhaps due to the
challenges posed by the discrete nature of language data. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive and unifying survey of data augmentation for NLP by
summarizing the literature in a structured manner. We first introduce and
motivate data augmentation for NLP, and then discuss major methodologically
representative approaches. Next, we highlight techniques that are used for
popular NLP applications and tasks. We conclude by outlining current challenges
and directions for future research. Overall, our paper aims to clarify the
landscape of existing literature in data augmentation for NLP and motivate
additional work in this area. We also present a GitHub repository with a paper

                    <span>The problem of knowledge-based visual question answering involves answering
questions that require external knowledge in addition to the content of the
image. Such knowledge typically comes in a variety of forms, including visual,
textual, and commonsense knowledge. The use of more knowledge sources, however,
also increases the chance of retrieving more irrelevant or noisy facts, making
it difficult to comprehend the facts and find the answer. To address this
challenge, we propose Multi-modal Answer Validation using External knowledge
(MAVEx), where the idea is to validate a set of promising answer candidates
based on answer-specific knowledge retrieval. This is in contrast to existing
approaches that search for the answer in a vast collection of often irrelevant
facts. Our approach aims to learn which knowledge source should be trusted for
each answer candidate and how to validate the candidate using that source. We
consider a multi-modal setting, relying on both textual and visual knowledge
resources, including images searched using Google, sentences from Wikipedia
articles, and concepts from ConceptNet. Our experiments with OK-VQA, a
challenging knowledge-based VQA dataset, demonstrate that MAVEx achieves new
state-of-the-art results.</span>

                    <span>Context-aware machine translation models are designed to leverage contextual
information, but often fail to do so. As a result, they inaccurately
disambiguate pronouns and polysemous words that require context for resolution.
In this paper, we ask several questions: What contexts do human translators use
to resolve ambiguous words? Are models paying large amounts of attention to the
same context? What if we explicitly train them to do so? To answer these
questions, we introduce SCAT (Supporting Context for Ambiguous Translations), a
new English-French dataset comprising supporting context words for 14K
translations that professional translators found useful for pronoun
disambiguation. Using SCAT, we perform an in-depth analysis of the context used
to disambiguate, examining positional and lexical characteristics of the
supporting words. Furthermore, we measure the degree of alignment between the
model&#x27;s attention scores and the supporting context from SCAT, and apply a
guided attention strategy to encourage agreement between the two.</span>

                    <span>Persona can function as the prior knowledge for maintaining the consistency
of dialogue systems. Most of previous studies adopted the self persona in
dialogue whose response was about to be selected from a set of candidates or
directly generated, but few have noticed the role of partner in dialogue. This
paper makes an attempt to thoroughly explore the impact of utilizing personas
that describe either self or partner speakers on the task of response selection
in retrieval-based chatbots. Four persona fusion strategies are designed, which
assume personas interact with contexts or responses in different ways. These
strategies are implemented into three representative models for response
selection, which are based on the Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder (HRE),
Interactive Matching Network (IMN) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations
from Transformers (BERT) respectively. Empirical studies on the Persona-Chat
dataset show that the partner personas neglected in previous studies can
improve the accuracy of response selection in the IMN- and BERT-based models.
Besides, our BERT-based model implemented with the context-response-aware
persona fusion strategy outperforms previous methods by margins larger than
2.7% on original personas and 4.6% on revised personas in terms of hits@1
(top-1 accuracy), achieving a new state-of-the-art performance on the
Persona-Chat dataset.</span>

                    <span>Text-to-image retrieval is an essential task in cross-modal information
retrieval, i.e., retrieving relevant images from a large and unlabelled dataset
given textual queries. In this paper, we propose VisualSparta, a novel
(Visual-text Sparse Transformer Matching) model that shows significant
improvement in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. VisualSparta is capable
of outperforming previous state-of-the-art scalable methods in MSCOCO and
Flickr30K. We also show that it achieves substantial retrieving speed
advantages, i.e., for a 1 million image index, VisualSparta using CPU gets
~391X speedup compared to CPU vector search and ~5.4X speedup compared to
vector search with GPU acceleration. Experiments show that this speed advantage
even gets bigger for larger datasets because VisualSparta can be efficiently
implemented as an inverted index. To the best of our knowledge, VisualSparta is
the first transformer-based text-to-image retrieval model that can achieve
real-time searching for large-scale datasets, with significant accuracy
improvement compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>Automated unit test case generation tools facilitate test-driven development
and support developers by suggesting tests intended to identify flaws in their
code. Existing approaches are usually guided by the test coverage criteria,
generating synthetic test cases that are often difficult for developers to read
or understand. In this paper we propose AthenaTest, an approach that aims to
generate unit test cases by learning from real-world focal methods and
developer-written testcases. We formulate unit test case generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning task, adopting a two-step training procedure
consisting of denoising pretraining on a large unsupervised Java corpus, and
supervised finetuning for a downstream translation task of generating unit
tests. We investigate the impact of natural language and source code
pretraining, as well as the focal context information surrounding the focal
method. Both techniques provide improvements in terms of validation loss, with
pretraining yielding 25% relative improvement and focal context providing
additional 11.1% improvement. We also introduce Methods2Test, the largest
publicly available supervised parallel corpus of unit test case methods and
corresponding focal methods in Java, which comprises 780K test cases mined from
91K open-source repositories from GitHub. We evaluate AthenaTest on five
defects4j projects, generating 25K passing test cases covering 43.7% of the
focal methods with only 30 attempts. We execute the test cases, collect test
coverage information, and compare them with test cases generated by EvoSuite
and GPT-3, finding that our approach outperforms GPT-3 and has comparable
coverage w.r.t. EvoSuite. Finally, we survey professional developers on their
preference in terms of readability, understandability, and testing
effectiveness of the generated tests, showing overwhelmingly preference towards
AthenaTest.</span>

                    <span>Contemporary approaches to perception, planning, estimation, and control have
allowed robots to operate robustly as our remote surrogates in uncertain,
unstructured environments. There is now an opportunity for robots to operate
not only in isolation, but also with and alongside humans in our complex
environments. Natural language provides an efficient and flexible medium
through which humans can communicate with collaborative robots. Through
significant progress in statistical methods for natural language understanding,
robots are now able to interpret a diverse array of free-form navigation,
manipulation, and mobile manipulation commands. However, most contemporary
approaches require a detailed prior spatial-semantic map of the robot&#x27;s
environment that models the space of possible referents of the utterance.
Consequently, these methods fail when robots are deployed in new, previously
unknown, or partially observed environments, particularly when mental models of
the environment differ between the human operator and the robot. This paper
provides a comprehensive description of a novel learning framework that allows
field and service robots to interpret and correctly execute natural language
instructions in a priori unknown, unstructured environments. Integral to our
approach is its use of language as a &quot;sensor&quot; -- inferring spatial,
topological, and semantic information implicit in natural language utterances
and then exploiting this information to learn a distribution over a latent
environment model. We incorporate this distribution in a probabilistic language
grounding model and infer a distribution over a symbolic representation of the
robot&#x27;s action space. We use imitation learning to identify a belief space
policy that reasons over the environment and behavior distributions. We
evaluate our framework through a variety of different navigation and mobile
manipulation experiments.</span>

                    <span>We consider the problem of using observational data to estimate the causal
effects of linguistic properties. For example, does writing a complaint
politely lead to a faster response time? How much will a positive product
review increase sales? This paper addresses two technical challenges related to
the problem before developing a practical method. First, we formalize the
causal quantity of interest as the effect of a writer&#x27;s intent, and establish
the assumptions necessary to identify this from observational data. Second, in
practice, we only have access to noisy proxies for the linguistic properties of
interest -- e.g., predictions from classifiers and lexicons. We propose an
estimator for this setting and prove that its bias is bounded when we perform
an adjustment for the text. Based on these results, we introduce TextCause, an
algorithm for estimating causal effects of linguistic properties. The method
leverages (1) distant supervision to improve the quality of noisy proxies, and
(2) a pre-trained language model (BERT) to adjust for the text. We show that
the proposed method outperforms related approaches when estimating the effect
of Amazon review sentiment on semi-simulated sales figures. Finally, we present
an applied case study investigating the effects of complaint politeness on
bureaucratic response times.</span>

                    <span>Sentence embeddings are an important component of many natural language
processing (NLP) systems. Like word embeddings, sentence embeddings are
typically learned on large text corpora and then transferred to various
downstream tasks, such as clustering and retrieval. Unlike word embeddings, the
highest performing solutions for learning sentence embeddings require labelled
data, limiting their usefulness to languages and domains where labelled data is
abundant. In this paper, we present DeCLUTR: Deep Contrastive Learning for
Unsupervised Textual Representations. Inspired by recent advances in deep
metric learning (DML), we carefully design a self-supervised objective for
learning universal sentence embeddings that does not require labelled training
data. When used to extend the pretraining of transformer-based language models,
our approach closes the performance gap between unsupervised and supervised
pretraining for universal sentence encoders. Importantly, our experiments
suggest that the quality of the learned embeddings scale with both the number
of trainable parameters and the amount of unlabelled training data, making
further improvements straightforward. Our code and pretrained models are
publicly available and can be easily adapted to new domains or used to embed
unseen text.</span>

                    <span>Probes are models devised to investigate the encoding of knowledge -- e.g.
syntactic structure -- in contextual representations. Probes are often designed
for simplicity, which has led to restrictions on probe design that may not
allow for the full exploitation of the structure of encoded information; one
such restriction is linearity. We examine the case of a structural probe
(Hewitt and Manning, 2019), which aims to investigate the encoding of syntactic
structure in contextual representations through learning only linear
transformations. By observing that the structural probe learns a metric, we are
able to kernelize it and develop a novel non-linear variant with an identical
number of parameters. We test on 6 languages and find that the radial-basis
function (RBF) kernel, in conjunction with regularization, achieves a
statistically significant improvement over the baseline in all languages --
implying that at least part of the syntactic knowledge is encoded non-linearly.
We conclude by discussing how the RBF kernel resembles BERT&#x27;s self-attention
layers and speculate that this resemblance leads to the RBF-based probe&#x27;s
stronger performance.</span>

                    <span>Distantly supervision automatically generates plenty of training samples for
relation extraction. However, it also incurs two major problems: noisy labels
and imbalanced training data. Previous works focus more on reducing wrongly
labeled relations (false positives) while few explore the missing relations
that are caused by incompleteness of knowledge base (false negatives).
Furthermore, the quantity of negative labels overwhelmingly surpasses the
positive ones in previous problem formulations. In this paper, we first provide
a thorough analysis of the above challenges caused by negative data. Next, we
formulate the problem of relation extraction into as a positive unlabeled
learning task to alleviate false negative problem. Thirdly, we propose a
pipeline approach, dubbed \textsc{ReRe}, that performs sentence-level relation
detection then subject/object extraction to achieve sample-efficient training.
Experimental results show that the proposed method consistently outperforms
existing approaches and remains excellent performance even learned with a large
quantity of false positive samples.</span>

                    <span>End-to-end spoken language understanding (SLU) has recently attracted
increasing interest. Compared to the conventional tandem-based approach that
combines speech recognition and language understanding as separate modules, the
new approach extracts users&#x27; intentions directly from the speech signals,
resulting in joint optimization and low latency. Such an approach, however, is
typically designed to process one intention at a time, which leads users to
take multiple rounds to fulfill their requirements while interacting with a
dialogue system. In this paper, we propose a streaming end-to-end framework
that can process multiple intentions in an online and incremental way. The
backbone of our framework is a unidirectional RNN trained with the
connectionist temporal classification (CTC) criterion. By this design, an
intention can be identified when sufficient evidence has been accumulated, and
multiple intentions can be identified sequentially. We evaluate our solution on
the Fluent Speech Commands (FSC) dataset and the intent detection accuracy is
about 97 % on all multi-intent settings. This result is comparable to the
performance of the state-of-the-art non-streaming models, but is achieved in an
online and incremental way. We also employ our model to a keyword spotting task
using the Google Speech Commands dataset and the results are also highly
promising.</span>

Representation (AMR) to help dialogue modeling. Compared with the textual
input, AMR explicitly provides core semantic knowledge and reduces data
sparsity. We develop an algorithm to construct dialogue-level AMR graphs from
sentence-level AMRs and explore two ways to incorporate AMRs into dialogue

                    <span>Personalized conversation models (PCMs) generate responses according to
speaker preferences. Existing personalized conversation tasks typically require
models to extract speaker preferences from user descriptions or their
conversation histories, which are scarce for newcomers and inactive users. In
this paper, we propose a few-shot personalized conversation task with an
auxiliary social network. The task requires models to generate personalized
responses for a speaker given a few conversations from the speaker and a social
network. Existing methods are mainly designed to incorporate descriptions or
conversation histories. Those methods can hardly model speakers with so few
conversations or connections between speakers. To better cater for newcomers
with few resources, we propose a personalized conversation model (PCM) that
learns to adapt to new speakers as well as enabling new speakers to learn from
resource-rich speakers. Particularly, based on a meta-learning based PCM, we
propose a task aggregator (TA) to collect other speakers&#x27; information from the
social network. The TA provides prior knowledge of the new speaker in its
meta-learning. Experimental results show our methods outperform all baselines
in appropriateness, diversity, and consistency with speakers.</span>

                    <span>In a dialogue system pipeline, a natural language generation (NLG) unit
converts the dialogue direction and content to a corresponding natural language
realization. A recent trend for dialogue systems is to first pre-train on large
datasets and then fine-tune in a supervised manner using datasets annotated
with application-specific features. Though novel behaviours can be learned from
custom annotation, the required effort severely bounds the quantity of the
training set, and the application-specific nature limits the reuse. In light of
the recent success of data-driven approaches, we propose the novel future
bridging NLG (FBNLG) concept for dialogue systems and simulators. The critical
step is for an FBNLG to accept a future user or system utterance to bridge the
present context towards. Future bridging enables self supervised training over
annotation-free datasets, decoupled the training of NLG from the rest of the
system. An FBNLG, pre-trained with massive datasets, is expected to apply in
classical or new dialogue scenarios with minimal adaptation effort. We evaluate
a prototype FBNLG to show that future bridging can be a viable approach to a
universal few-shot NLG for task-oriented and chit-chat dialogues.</span>

                    <span>Logical reasoning, which is closely related to human cognition, is of vital
importance in human&#x27;s understanding of texts. Recent years have witnessed
increasing attentions on machine&#x27;s logical reasoning abilities. However,
previous studies commonly apply ad-hoc methods to model pre-defined relation
patterns, such as linking named entities, which only considers global knowledge
components that are related to commonsense, without local perception of
complete facts or events. Such methodology is obviously insufficient to deal
with complicated logical structures. Therefore, we argue that the natural logic
units would be the group of backbone constituents of the sentence such as the
subject-verb-object formed &quot;facts&quot;, covering both global and local knowledge
pieces that are necessary as the basis for logical reasoning. Beyond building
the ad-hoc graphs, we propose a more general and convenient fact-driven
approach to construct a supergraph on top of our newly defined fact units, and
enhance the supergraph with further explicit guidance of local question and
option interactions. Experiments on two challenging logical reasoning benchmark
datasets, ReClor and LogiQA, show that our proposed model, \textsc{Focal
Reasoner}, outperforms the baseline models dramatically. It can also be
smoothly applied to other downstream tasks such as MuTual, a dialogue reasoning
dataset, achieving competitive results.</span>

We approximate Bayesian summary generation by first extending state-of-the-art
summarization models with Monte Carlo dropout and then using them to perform
multiple stochastic forward passes. This method allows us to improve
summarization performance by simply using the median of multiple stochastic
summaries. We show that our variational equivalents of BART and PEGASUS can
outperform their deterministic counterparts on multiple benchmark datasets. In
addition, we rely on Bayesian inference to measure the uncertainty of the model
when generating summaries. Having a reliable uncertainty measure, we can
improve the experience of the end user by filtering out generated summaries of
high uncertainty. Furthermore, our proposed metric could be used as a criterion
for selecting samples for annotation, and can be paired nicely with active
learning and human-in-the-loop approaches.</span>

                    <span>Biology offers many examples of large-scale, complex, concurrent systems:
many processes take place in parallel, compete on resources and influence each
other&#x27;s behavior. The scalable modeling of biological systems continues to be a
very active field of research. In this paper we introduce a new approach based
on Event-B, a state-based formal method with refinement as its central
ingredient, allowing us to check for model consistency step-by-step in an
automated way. Our approach based on functions leads to an elegant and concise
modeling method. We demonstrate this approach by constructing what is, to our
knowledge, the largest ever built Event-B model, describing the ErbB signaling
pathway, a key evolutionary pathway with a significant role in development and
in many types of cancer. The Event-B model for the ErbB pathway describes 1320
molecular reactions through 242 events.</span>

                    <span>Recently, unsupervised parsing of syntactic trees has gained considerable
attention. A prototypical approach to such unsupervised parsing employs
reinforcement learning and auto-encoders. However, no mechanism ensures that
the learnt model leverages the well-understood language grammar. We propose an
approach that utilizes very generic linguistic knowledge of the language
present in the form of syntactic rules, thus inducing better syntactic
structures. We introduce a novel formulation that takes advantage of the
syntactic grammar rules and is independent of the base system. We achieve new
state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks datasets, MNLI and WSJ. The source

                    <span>This paper investigates the research question if senders of large amounts of
irrelevant or unsolicited information - commonly called &quot;spammers&quot; - distort
the network structure of social networks. Two large social networks are
analyzed, the first extracted from the Twitter discourse about a big
telecommunication company, and the second obtained from three years of email
communication of 200 managers working for a large multinational company. This
work compares network robustness and the stability of centrality and
interaction metrics, as well as the use of language, after removing spammers
and the most and least connected nodes. The results show that spammers do not
significantly alter the structure of the information-carrying network, for most
of the social indicators. The authors additionally investigate the correlation
between e-mail subject line and content by tracking language sentiment,
emotionality, and complexity, addressing the cases where collecting email
bodies is not permitted for privacy reasons. The findings extend the research
about robustness and stability of social networks metrics, after the
application of graph simplification strategies. The results have practical
implication for network analysts and for those company managers who rely on
network analytics (applied to company emails and social media data) to support
their decision-making processes.</span>

                    <span>Sarcasm detection and humor classification are inherently subtle problems,
primarily due to their dependence on the contextual and non-verbal information.
Furthermore, existing studies in these two topics are usually constrained in
non-English languages such as Hindi, due to the unavailability of qualitative
annotated datasets. In this work, we make two major contributions considering
the above limitations: (1) we develop a Hindi-English code-mixed dataset,
MaSaC, for the multi-modal sarcasm detection and humor classification in
conversational dialog, which to our knowledge is the first dataset of its kind;
(2) we propose MSH-COMICS, a novel attention-rich neural architecture for the
utterance classification. We learn efficient utterance representation utilizing
a hierarchical attention mechanism that attends to a small portion of the input
sentence at a time. Further, we incorporate dialog-level contextual attention
mechanism to leverage the dialog history for the multi-modal classification. We
perform extensive experiments for both the tasks by varying multi-modal inputs
and various submodules of MSH-COMICS. We also conduct comparative analysis
against existing approaches. We observe that MSH-COMICS attains superior
performance over the existing models by &gt; 1 F1-score point for the sarcasm
detection and 10 F1-score points in humor classification. We diagnose our model
and perform thorough analysis of the results to understand the superiority and
pitfalls.</span>

language processing. In this task, given a series of natural language captions
which compose a story, an agent must generate a sequence of images that
correspond to the captions. Prior work has introduced recurrent generative
models which outperform text-to-image synthesis models on this task. However,
there is room for improvement of generated images in terms of visual quality,
coherence and relevance. We present a number of improvements to prior modeling
approaches, including (1) the addition of a dual learning framework that
utilizes video captioning to reinforce the semantic alignment between the story
and generated images, (2) a copy-transform mechanism for
sequentially-consistent story visualization, and (3) MART-based transformers to
model complex interactions between frames. We present ablation studies to
demonstrate the effect of each of these techniques on the generative power of
the model for both individual images as well as the entire narrative.
Furthermore, due to the complexity and generative nature of the task, standard
evaluation metrics do not accurately reflect performance. Therefore, we also
provide an exploration of evaluation metrics for the model, focused on aspects
of the generated frames such as the presence/quality of generated characters,
the relevance to captions, and the diversity of the generated images. We also
present correlation experiments of our proposed automated metrics with human
evaluations. Code and data available at:

nearly every NLP task and Word Sense Disambiguation, the problem of discerning
the correct sense of a word in a given context, is no exception.
State-of-the-art approaches in WSD today leverage lexical information along
with pre-trained embeddings from these models to achieve results comparable to
human inter-annotator agreement on standard evaluation benchmarks. In the same
vein, we experiment with several strategies to optimize bi-encoders for this
specific task and propose alternative methods of presenting lexical information
to our model. Through our multi-stage pre-training and fine-tuning pipeline we
further the state of the art in Word Sense Disambiguation.</span>

can accept either video or text input, or both for a variety of end tasks.
Existing pre-training are task-specific by adopting either a single cross-modal
encoder that requires both modalities, limiting their use for retrieval-style
end tasks or more complex multitask learning with two unimodal encoders,
limiting early cross-modal fusion. We instead introduce new pretraining masking
schemes that better mix across modalities (e.g. by forcing masks for text to
predict the closest video embeddings) while also maintaining separability (e.g.
unimodal predictions are sometimes required, without using all the input).
Experimental results show strong performance across a wider range of tasks than
any previous methods, often outperforming task-specific pre-training.</span>

                    <span>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) becomes a standard law for data
protection in many countries. Currently, twelve countries adopt the regulation
and establish their GDPR-like regulation. However, to evaluate the differences
and similarities of these GDPR-like regulations is time-consuming and needs a
lot of manual effort from legal experts. Moreover, GDPR-like regulations from
different countries are written in their languages leading to a more difficult
task since legal experts who know both languages are essential. In this paper,
we investigate a simple natural language processing (NLP) approach to tackle
the problem. We first extract chunks of information from GDPR-like documents
and form structured data from natural language. Next, we use NLP methods to
compare documents to measure their similarity. Finally, we manually label a
small set of data to evaluate our approach. The empirical result shows that the
BERT model with cosine similarity outperforms other baselines. Our data and

                    <span>In this work, we introduce ASQ, a tool to automatically mine questions and
answers from a sentence, using its Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR).
Previous work has made a case for using question-answer pairs to specify
predicate-argument structure of a sentence using natural language, which does
not require linguistic expertise or training. This has resulted in the creation
of datasets such as QA-SRL and QAMR, for both of which, the question-answer
pair annotations were crowdsourced. Our approach has the same end-goal, but is
automatic, making it faster and cost-effective, without compromising on the
quality and validity of the question-answer pairs thus obtained. A qualitative
evaluation of the output generated by ASQ from the AMR 2.0 data shows that the
question-answer pairs are natural and valid, and demonstrate good coverage of
the content. We run ASQ on the sentences from the QAMR dataset, to observe that
the semantic roles in QAMR are also captured by ASQ.We intend to make this tool
and the results publicly available for others to use and build upon.</span>

                    <span>Span-based joint extraction simultaneously conducts named entity recognition
(NER) and relation extraction (RE) in text span form. Recent studies have shown
that token labels can convey crucial task-specific information and enrich token
semantics. However, as far as we know, due to completely abstain from sequence
tagging mechanism, all prior span-based work fails to use token label
in-formation. To solve this problem, we pro-pose Sequence Tagging enhanced
Span-based Network (STSN), a span-based joint extrac-tion network that is
enhanced by token BIO label information derived from sequence tag-ging based
NER. By stacking multiple atten-tion layers in depth, we design a deep neu-ral
architecture to build STSN, and each atten-tion layer consists of three basic
attention units. The deep neural architecture first learns seman-tic
representations for token labels and span-based joint extraction, and then
constructs in-formation interactions between them, which also realizes
bidirectional information interac-tions between span-based NER and RE.
Fur-thermore, we extend the BIO tagging scheme to make STSN can extract
overlapping en-tity. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our
model consistently outperforms previous optimal models by a large margin,
creating new state-of-the-art results.</span>

                    <span>Supervised deep learning has swiftly become a workhorse for accelerated MRI
in recent years, offering state-of-the-art performance in image reconstruction
from undersampled acquisitions. Training deep supervised models requires large
datasets of undersampled and fully-sampled acquisitions typically from a
matching set of subjects. Given scarce access to large medical datasets, this
limitation has sparked interest in unsupervised methods that reduce reliance on
fully-sampled ground-truth data. A common framework is based on the deep image
prior, where network-driven regularization is enforced directly during
inference on undersampled acquisitions. Yet, canonical convolutional
architectures are suboptimal in capturing long-range relationships, and
randomly initialized networks may hamper convergence. To address these
limitations, here we introduce a novel unsupervised MRI reconstruction method
based on zero-Shot Learned Adversarial TransformERs (SLATER). SLATER embodies a
deep adversarial network with cross-attention transformer blocks to map noise
and latent variables onto MR images. This unconditional network learns a
high-quality MRI prior in a self-supervised encoding task. A zero-shot
reconstruction is performed on undersampled test data, where inference is
performed by optimizing network parameters, latent and noise variables to
ensure maximal consistency to multi-coil MRI data. Comprehensive experiments on
brain MRI datasets clearly demonstrate the superior performance of SLATER
against several state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.</span>

applications. For example, building footprints are useful for high fidelity

~1/4 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Indicators. In this
paper we (the SpaceNet Partners) discuss efforts to develop techniques for
precise building footprint localization, tracking, and change detection via the

Planet Labs satellite imagery mosaics at 4m resolution, which includes 24

                    <span>Prostate cancer is one of the main diseases affecting men worldwide. The gold
standard for diagnosis and prognosis is the Gleason grading system. In this
process, pathologists manually analyze prostate histology slides under
microscope, in a high time-consuming and subjective task. In the last years,
computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) systems have emerged as a promising tool that
could support pathologists in the daily clinical practice. Nevertheless, these
systems are usually trained using tedious and prone-to-error pixel-level
annotations of Gleason grades in the tissue. To alleviate the need of manual
pixel-wise labeling, just a handful of works have been presented in the
literature. Motivated by this, we propose a novel weakly-supervised
deep-learning model, based on self-learning CNNs, that leverages only the
global Gleason score of gigapixel whole slide images during training to
accurately perform both, grading of patch-level patterns and biopsy-level
scoring. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we perform
extensive experiments on three different external datasets for the patch-level
Gleason grading, and on two different test sets for global Grade Group
prediction. We empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms its
supervised counterpart on patch-level Gleason grading by a large margin, as
well as state-of-the-art methods on global biopsy-level scoring. Particularly,
the proposed model brings an average improvement on the Cohen&#x27;s quadratic kappa
(k) score of nearly 18% compared to full-supervision for the patch-level
Gleason grading task.</span>

                    <span>Recently, text detection has attracted sufficient attention in the field of
computer vision and artificial intelligence. Among the existing approaches,
regression-based models are limited to handle the texts with arbitrary shapes,
while segmentation-based algorithms have high computational costs and suffer
from the text adhesion problem. In this paper, we propose a new one-stage text
detector, termed as Bold Outline Text Detector (BOTD), which is able to process
the arbitrary-shaped text with low model complexity. Different from previous
works, BOTD utilizes the Polar Minimum Distance (PMD) to encode the shortest
distance between the center point and the contour of the text instance, and
generates a Center Mask (CM) for each text instance. After learning the PMD
heat map and CM map, the final results can be obtained with a simple Text
Reconstruction Module (TRM). Since the CM resides within the text box exactly,
the text adhesion problem is avoided naturally. Meanwhile, all the points on
the text contour share the same PMD, so the complexity of BOTD is much lower
than existing segmentation-based methods. Experimental results on three
real-world benchmarks show the state-of-the-art performance of BOTD.</span>

                    <span>Quantifying uncertainty in a model&#x27;s predictions is important as it enables
the safety of an AI system to be increased by acting on the model&#x27;s output in
an informed manner. This is crucial for applications where the cost of an error
is high, such as in autonomous vehicle control, medical image analysis,
financial estimations or legal fields. Deep Neural Networks are powerful
predictors that have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide
spectrum of tasks. Quantifying predictive uncertainty in DNNs is a challenging
and yet on-going problem. In this paper we propose a complete framework to
capture and quantify all of these three types of uncertainties in DNNs for
image classification. This framework includes an ensemble of CNNs for model
uncertainty, a supervised reconstruction auto-encoder to capture distributional
uncertainty and using the output of activation functions in the last layer of
the network, to capture data uncertainty. Finally we demonstrate the efficiency

                    <span>The Gleason scoring system is the primary diagnostic and prognostic tool for
prostate cancer. In recent years, with the development of digitisation devices,
the use of computer vision techniques for the analysis of biopsies has
increased. However, to the best of the authors&#x27; knowledge, the development of
algorithms to automatically detect individual cribriform patterns belonging to
Gleason grade 4 has not yet been studied in the literature. The objective of
the work presented in this paper is to develop a deep-learning-based system
able to support pathologists in the daily analysis of prostate biopsies. The
methodological core of this work is a patch-wise predictive model based on
convolutional neural networks able to determine the presence of cancerous
patterns. In particular, we train from scratch a simple self-design
architecture. The cribriform pattern is detected by retraining the set of
filters of the last convolutional layer in the network. From the reconstructed
prediction map, we compute the percentage of each Gleason grade in the tissue
to feed a multi-layer perceptron which provides a biopsy-level score.mIn our
SICAPv2 database, composed of 182 annotated whole slide images, we obtained a
Cohen&#x27;s quadratic kappa of 0.77 in the test set for the patch-level Gleason
grading with the proposed architecture trained from scratch. Our results
outperform previous ones reported in the literature. Furthermore, this model
reaches the level of fine-tuned state-of-the-art architectures in a
patient-based four groups cross validation. In the cribriform pattern detection
task, we obtained an area under ROC curve of 0.82. Regarding the biopsy Gleason
scoring, we achieved a quadratic Cohen&#x27;s Kappa of 0.81 in the test subset.
Shallow CNN architectures trained from scratch outperform current
state-of-the-art methods for Gleason grades classification.</span>

                    <span>Capillaries are the smallest vessels in the body responsible for the delivery
of oxygen and nutrients to the surrounding cells. Various diseases have been
shown to alter the density of nutritive capillaries and the flow velocity of
erythrocytes. In previous studies, capillary density and flow velocity have
been assessed manually by trained specialists. Manual analysis of a 20-second
long microvascular video takes on average 20 minutes and requires extensive
training. Several studies have reported that manual analysis hinders the
application of microvascular microscopy in a clinical setting. In this paper,
we present a fully automated system, called CapillaryNet, that can automate
microvascular microscopy analysis so it can be used as a clinical application.
Moreover, CapillaryNet measures several microvascular parameters that
researchers were previously unable to quantify, i.e. capillary hematocrit and
intra-capillary flow velocity heterogeneity.</span>

                    <span>Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have achieved great success in dealing
with data of non-Euclidean structures. Their success directly attributes to
fitting graph structures effectively to data such as in social media and
knowledge databases. For image processing applications, the use of graph
structures and GCNs have not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose a
novel encoder-decoder network with added graph convolutions by converting
feature maps to vertexes of a pre-generated graph to synthetically construct
graph-structured data. By doing this, we inexplicitly apply graph Laplacian
regularization to the feature maps, making them more structured. The
experiments show that it significantly boosts performance for image restoration
tasks, including deblurring and super-resolution. We believe it opens up
opportunities for GCN-based approaches in more applications.</span>

                    <span>Prior work has shown Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on
surrogate Computer Aided Design (CAD) models are able to detect and classify
real-world artefacts from photographs. The applications of which support
twinning of digital and physical assets in design, including rapid extraction
of part geometry from model repositories, information search \&amp; retrieval and
identifying components in the field for maintenance, repair, and recording. The
performance of CNNs in classification tasks have been shown dependent on
training data set size and number of classes. Where prior works have used
relatively small surrogate model data sets ($&lt;100$ models), the question
remains as to the ability of a CNN to differentiate between models in
increasingly large model repositories. This paper presents a method for
generating synthetic image data sets from online CAD model repositories, and
further investigates the capacity of an off-the-shelf CNN architecture trained
on synthetic data to classify models as class size increases. 1,000 CAD models
were curated and processed to generate large scale surrogate data sets,
featuring model coverage at steps of 10$^{\circ}$, 30$^{\circ}$, 60$^{\circ}$,
and 120$^{\circ}$ degrees. The findings demonstrate the capability of computer
vision algorithms to classify artefacts in model repositories of up to 200,
beyond this point the CNN&#x27;s performance is observed to deteriorate
significantly, limiting its present ability for automated twinning of physical
to digital artefacts. Although, a match is more often found in the top-5
results showing potential for information search and retrieval on large
repositories of surrogate models.</span>

                    <span>High quality perception is essential for autonomous driving (AD) systems. To
reach the accuracy and robustness that are required by such systems, several
types of sensors must be combined. Currently, mostly cameras and laser scanners
(lidar) are deployed to build a representation of the world around the vehicle.
While radar sensors have been used for a long time in the automotive industry,
they are still under-used for AD despite their appealing characteristics
(notably, their ability to measure the relative speed of obstacles and to
operate even in adverse weather conditions). To a large extent, this situation
is due to the relative lack of automotive datasets with real radar signals that
are both raw and annotated. In this work, we introduce CARRADA, a dataset of
synchronized camera and radar recordings with range-angle-Doppler annotations.
We also present a semi-automatic annotation approach, which was used to
annotate the dataset, and a radar semantic segmentation baseline, which we
evaluate on several metrics. Both our code and dataset are available online.</span>

interpretation and analysis has become critical. This is particularly true when
data comes from complex systems where extensive structure is available, but
must be drawn from peripheral sources. In this paper we argue that in such
situations, sheaves can provide a natural framework to analyze how well a
statistical model fits at the local level (that is, on subsets of related
datapoints) vs the global level (on all the data). The sheaf-based approach
that we propose is suitably general enough to be useful in a range of
applications, from analyzing sensor networks to understanding the feature space
of a deep learning model.</span>

                    <span>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are one of the greatest advances in AI
in recent years. With their ability to directly learn the probability
distribution of data, and then sample synthetic realistic data. Many
applications have emerged, using GANs to solve classical problems in machine
learning, such as data augmentation, class unbalance problems, and fair
representation learning. In this paper, we analyze and highlight fairness
concerns of GANs model. In this regard, we show empirically that GANs models
may inherently prefer certain groups during the training process and therefore
they&#x27;re not able to homogeneously generate data from different groups during
the testing phase. Furthermore, we propose solutions to solve this issue by
conditioning the GAN model towards samples&#x27; group or using ensemble method
(boosting) to allow the GAN model to leverage distributed structure of data
during the training phase and generate groups at equal rate during the testing
phase.</span>

words. This paper proposes Impressions2Font (Imp2Font) that generates font

conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). More precisely, Imp2Font
accepts an arbitrary number of impression words as the condition to generate
the font images. These impression words are converted into a soft-constraint

Qualitative and quantitative evaluations prove that Imp2Font generates font

classification of skin disease images; however these algorithms have been
mostly applied &quot;in silico&quot; and not validated clinically. Most dermatology AI
algorithms perform binary classification tasks (e.g. malignancy versus benign
lesions), but this task is not representative of dermatologists&#x27; diagnostic

                    <span>This work attempts to provide a plausible theoretical framework that aims to
interpret modern deep (convolutional) networks from the principles of data
compression and discriminative representation. We show that for
high-dimensional multi-class data, the optimal linear discriminative
representation maximizes the coding rate difference between the whole dataset
and the average of all the subsets. We show that the basic iterative gradient
ascent scheme for optimizing the rate reduction objective naturally leads to a
multi-layer deep network, named ReduNet, that shares common characteristics of
modern deep networks. The deep layered architectures, linear and nonlinear
operators, and even parameters of the network are all explicitly constructed
layer-by-layer via forward propagation, instead of learned via back
propagation. All components of so-obtained &quot;white-box&quot; network have precise
optimization, statistical, and geometric interpretation. Moreover, all linear
operators of the so-derived network naturally become multi-channel convolutions
when we enforce classification to be rigorously shift-invariant. The derivation
also indicates that such a deep convolution network is significantly more
efficient to construct and learn in the spectral domain. Our preliminary
simulations and experiments clearly verify the effectiveness of both the rate
reduction objective and the associated ReduNet. All code and data are available

                    <span>The way features propagate in Fully Convolutional Networks is of momentous
importance to capture multi-scale contexts for obtaining precise segmentation
masks. This paper proposes a novel series-parallel hybrid paradigm called the
Chained Context Aggregation Module (CAM) to diversify feature propagation. CAM
gains features of various spatial scales through chain-connected ladder-style
information flows and fuses them in a two-stage process, namely pre-fusion and
re-fusion. The serial flow continuously increases receptive fields of output
neurons and those in parallel encode different region-based contexts. Each
information flow is a shallow encoder-decoder with appropriate down-sampling
scales to sufficiently capture contextual information. We further adopt an
attention model in CAM to guide feature re-fusion. Based on these developments,
we construct the Chained Context Aggregation Network (CANet), which employs an
asymmetric decoder to recover precise spatial details of prediction maps. We
conduct extensive experiments on six challenging datasets, including Pascal VOC
2012, Pascal Context, Cityscapes, CamVid, SUN-RGBD and GATECH. Results evidence
that CANet achieves state-of-the-art performance.</span>

variable playback speeds of a video. Without semantic labels, we learn the
spatio-temporal visual representation of the video by leveraging the variations
in the visual appearance according to different playback speeds under the
assumption of temporal coherence. To learn the spatio-temporal visual
variations in the entire video, we have not only predicted a single playback
speed but also generated clips of various playback speeds and directions with
randomized starting points. Hence the visual representation can be successfully
learned from the meta information (playback speeds and directions) of the
video. We also propose a new layer dependable temporal group normalization
method that can be applied to 3D convolutional networks to improve the
representation learning performance where we divide the temporal features into
several groups and normalize each one using the different corresponding
parameters. We validate the effectiveness of our method by fine-tuning it to
the action recognition and video retrieval tasks on UCF-101 and HMDB-51.</span>

retrieval, i.e., retrieving relevant images from a large and unlabelled dataset
given textual queries. In this paper, we propose VisualSparta, a novel

improvement in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. VisualSparta is capable
of outperforming previous state-of-the-art scalable methods in MSCOCO and

advantages, i.e., for a 1 million image index, VisualSparta using CPU gets
~391X speedup compared to CPU vector search and ~5.4X speedup compared to
vector search with GPU acceleration. Experiments show that this speed advantage
even gets bigger for larger datasets because VisualSparta can be efficiently
implemented as an inverted index. To the best of our knowledge, VisualSparta is
the first transformer-based text-to-image retrieval model that can achieve
real-time searching for large-scale datasets, with significant accuracy
improvement compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>Recently, there has been substantial progress in image synthesis from
semantic labelmaps. However, methods used for this task assume the availability
of complete and unambiguous labelmaps, with instance boundaries of objects, and
class labels for each pixel. This reliance on heavily annotated inputs
restricts the application of image synthesis techniques to real-world
applications, especially under uncertainty due to weather, occlusion, or noise.
On the other hand, algorithms that can synthesize images from sparse labelmaps
or sketches are highly desirable as tools that can guide content creators and
artists to quickly generate scenes by simply specifying locations of a few
objects. In this paper, we address the problem of complex scene completion from
sparse labelmaps. Under this setting, very few details about the scene (30\% of
object instances) are available as input for image synthesis. We propose a
two-stage deep network based method, called &#x60;Halluci-Net&#x27;, that learns
co-occurence relationships between objects in scenes, and then exploits these
relationships to produce a dense and complete labelmap. The generated dense
labelmap can then be used as input by state-of-the-art image synthesis
techniques like pix2pixHD to obtain the final image. The proposed method is
evaluated on the Cityscapes dataset and it outperforms two baselines methods on
performance metrics like Fr\&#x27;echet Inception Distance (FID), semantic
segmentation accuracy, and similarity in object co-occurrences. We also show
qualitative results on a subset of ADE20K dataset that contains bedroom images.</span>

                    <span>Ordinal embedding aims at finding a low dimensional representation of objects
from a set of constraints of the form &quot;item $j$ is closer to item $i$ than item
$k$&quot;. Typically, each object is mapped onto a point vector in a low dimensional
metric space. We argue that mapping to a density instead of a point vector
provides some interesting advantages, including an inherent reflection of the
uncertainty about the representation itself and its relative location in the
space. Indeed, in this paper, we propose to embed each object as a Gaussian
distribution. We investigate the ability of these embeddings to capture the
underlying structure of the data while satisfying the constraints, and explore
properties of the representation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets showcase the advantages of our approach. In addition, we illustrate
the merit of modelling uncertainty, which enriches the visual perception of the
mapped objects in the space.</span>

information simultaneously because of visual information bottleneck. The human
visual system mainly focuses on dominant parts of the scenes to reduce the
input visual redundancy information. It is commonly known as visual attention
prediction or visual saliency map. This paper proposes a new psychophysical
saliency prediction architecture, WECSF, inspired by human low-level visual
cortex function. The model consists of opponent color channels, wavelet
transform, wavelet energy map, and contrast sensitivity function for extracting
low-level image features and maximum approximation to the human visual system.
The proposed model is evaluated several datasets, including MIT1003, MIT300,
TORONTO, SID4VAM and UCF Sports dataset to explain its efficiency. We also
quantitatively and qualitatively compared the performance of saliency
prediction with other state-of-the-art models. Our model achieved very stable
and good performance. Second, we also confirmed that Fourier and
spectral-inspired saliency prediction models achieved outperformance compared
to other start-of-the-art non-neural networks and even deep neural network
models on psychophysical synthesis images. Finally, the proposed model also can
be applied to spatial-temporal saliency prediction and got better performance.</span>

                    <span>The need for accurate yield estimates for viticulture is becoming more
important due to increasing competition in the wine market worldwide. One of
the most promising methods to estimate the harvest is berry counting, as it can
be approached non-destructively, and its process can be automated. In this
article, we present a method that addresses the challenge of occluded berries
with leaves to obtain a more accurate estimate of the number of berries that
will enable a better estimate of the harvest. We use generative adversarial
networks, a deep learning-based approach that generates a likely scenario
behind the leaves exploiting learned patterns from images with non-occluded
berries. Our experiments show that the estimate of the number of berries after
applying our method is closer to the manually counted reference. In contrast to
applying a factor to the berry count, our approach better adapts to local
conditions by directly involving the appearance of the visible berries.
Furthermore, we show that our approach can identify which areas in the image
should be changed by adding new berries without explicitly requiring
information about hidden areas.</span>

                    <span>Vision transformers (ViT) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various machine vision problems. These models are based on multi-head
self-attention mechanisms that can flexibly attend to a sequence of image
patches to encode contextual cues. An important question is how such
flexibility in attending image-wide context conditioned on a given patch can
facilitate handling nuisances in natural images e.g., severe occlusions, domain
shifts, spatial permutations, adversarial and natural perturbations. We
systematically study this question via an extensive set of experiments
encompassing three ViT families and comparisons with a high-performing
convolutional neural network (CNN). We show and analyze the following
intriguing properties of ViT: (a) Transformers are highly robust to severe
occlusions, perturbations and domain shifts, e.g., retain as high as 60% top-1
accuracy on ImageNet even after randomly occluding 80% of the image content.
(b) The robust performance to occlusions is not due to a bias towards local
textures, and ViTs are significantly less biased towards textures compared to
CNNs. When properly trained to encode shape-based features, ViTs demonstrate
shape recognition capability comparable to that of human visual system,
previously unmatched in the literature. (c) Using ViTs to encode shape
representation leads to an interesting consequence of accurate semantic
segmentation without pixel-level supervision. (d) Off-the-shelf features from a
single ViT model can be combined to create a feature ensemble, leading to high
accuracy rates across a range of classification datasets in both traditional
and few-shot learning paradigms. We show effective features of ViTs are due to
flexible and dynamic receptive fields possible via the self-attention
mechanism.</span>

                    <span>We present a learning-based method for building driving-signal aware
full-body avatars. Our model is a conditional variational autoencoder that can
be animated with incomplete driving signals, such as human pose and facial
keypoints, and produces a high-quality representation of human geometry and
view-dependent appearance. The core intuition behind our method is that better
drivability and generalization can be achieved by disentangling the driving
signals and remaining generative factors, which are not available during
animation. To this end, we explicitly account for information deficiency in the
driving signal by introducing a latent space that exclusively captures the
remaining information, thus enabling the imputation of the missing factors
required during full-body animation, while remaining faithful to the driving
signal. We also propose a learnable localized compression for the driving
signal which promotes better generalization, and helps minimize the influence
of global chance-correlations often found in real datasets. For a given driving
signal, the resulting variational model produces a compact space of uncertainty
for missing factors that allows for an imputation strategy best suited to a
particular application. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on the
challenging problem of full-body animation for virtual telepresence with
driving signals acquired from minimal sensors placed in the environment and
mounted on a VR-headset.</span>

                    <span>Prostate cancer is one of the main diseases affecting men worldwide. The
Gleason scoring system is the primary diagnostic tool for prostate cancer. This
is obtained via the visual analysis of cancerous patterns in prostate biopsies
performed by expert pathologists, and the aggregation of the main Gleason
grades in a combined score. Computer-aided diagnosis systems allow to reduce
the workload of pathologists and increase the objectivity. Recently, efforts
have been made in the literature to develop algorithms aiming the direct
estimation of the global Gleason score at biopsy/core level with global labels.
However, these algorithms do not cover the accurate localization of the Gleason
patterns into the tissue. In this work, we propose a deep-learning-based system
able to detect local cancerous patterns in the prostate tissue using only the
global-level Gleason score during training. The methodological core of this
work is the proposed weakly-supervised-trained convolutional neural network,
WeGleNet, based on a multi-class segmentation layer after the feature
extraction module, a global-aggregation, and the slicing of the background
class for the model loss estimation during training. We obtained a Cohen&#x27;s
quadratic kappa (k) of 0.67 for the pixel-level prediction of cancerous
patterns in the validation cohort. We compared the model performance for
semantic segmentation of Gleason grades with supervised state-of-the-art
architectures in the test cohort. We obtained a pixel-level k of 0.61 and a
macro-averaged f1-score of 0.58, at the same level as fully-supervised methods.
Regarding the estimation of the core-level Gleason score, we obtained a k of
0.76 and 0.67 between the model and two different pathologists. WeGleNet is
capable of performing the semantic segmentation of Gleason grades similarly to
fully-supervised methods without requiring pixel-level annotations.</span>

                    <span>Single image super-resolution (SISR) deals with a fundamental problem of
upsampling a low-resolution (LR) image to its high-resolution (HR) version.
Last few years have witnessed impressive progress propelled by deep learning
methods. However, one critical challenge faced by existing methods is to strike
a sweet spot of deep model complexity and resulting SISR quality. This paper
addresses this pain point by proposing a linearly-assembled pixel-adaptive
regression network (LAPAR), which casts the direct LR to HR mapping learning
into a linear coefficient regression task over a dictionary of multiple
predefined filter bases. Such a parametric representation renders our model
highly lightweight and easy to optimize while achieving state-of-the-art
results on SISR benchmarks. Moreover, based on the same idea, LAPAR is extended
to tackle other restoration tasks, e.g., image denoising and JPEG image
deblocking, and again, yields strong performance. The code is available at

                    <span>We propose an efficient and straightforward method for compressing deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that uses basis filters to represent the
convolutional layers, and optimizes the performance of the compressed network
directly in the basis space. Specifically, any spatial convolution layer of the
CNN can be replaced by two successive convolution layers: the first is a set of
three-dimensional orthonormal basis filters, followed by a layer of
one-dimensional filters that represents the original spatial filters in the
basis space. We jointly fine-tune both the basis and the filter representation
to directly mitigate any performance loss due to the truncation. Generality of
the proposed approach is demonstrated by applying it to several well known deep
CNN architectures and data sets for image classification and object detection.
We also present the execution time and power usage at different compression
levels on the Xavier Jetson AGX processor.</span>

                    <span>We develop a novel compositional generative model for zero- and few-shot
learning to recognize fine-grained classes with a few or no training samples.
Our key observation is that generating holistic features for fine-grained
classes fails to capture small attribute differences between classes.
Therefore, we propose a feature composition framework that learns to extract
attribute features from training samples and combines them to construct
fine-grained features for rare and unseen classes. Feature composition allows
us to not only selectively compose features of every class from only relevant
training samples, but also obtain diversity among composed features via
changing samples used for the composition. In addition, instead of building
holistic features for classes, we use our attribute features to form dense
representations capable of capturing fine-grained attribute details of classes.
We propose a training scheme that uses a discriminative model to construct
features that are subsequently used to train the model itself. Therefore, we
directly train the discriminative model on the composed features without
learning a separate generative model. We conduct experiments on four popular
datasets of DeepFashion, AWA2, CUB, and SUN, showing the effectiveness of our
method.</span>

                    <span>Learning maps between data samples is fundamental. Applications range from
representation learning, image translation and generative modeling, to the
estimation of spatial deformations. Such maps relate feature vectors, or map
between feature spaces. Well-behaved maps should be regular, which can be
imposed explicitly or may emanate from the data itself. We explore what induces
regularity for spatial transformations, e.g., when computing image
registrations. Classical optimization-based models compute maps between pairs
of samples and rely on an appropriate regularizer for well-posedness. Recent
deep learning approaches have attempted to avoid using such regularizers
altogether by relying on the sample population instead. We explore if it is
possible to obtain spatial regularity using an inverse consistency loss only
and elucidate what explains map regularity in such a context. We find that deep
networks combined with an inverse consistency loss and randomized off-grid
interpolation yield well behaved, approximately diffeomorphic, spatial
transformations. Despite the simplicity of this approach, our experiments
present compelling evidence, on both synthetic and real data, that regular maps
can be obtained without carefully tuned explicit regularizers, while achieving
competitive registration performance.</span>

in robotics, due to its simplicity and ability to achieve transfer without any
real-world images at all. Nonetheless, a number of design choices must be made
to achieve optimal transfer. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive
benchmarking study on these different choices, with two key experiments
evaluated on a real-world object pose estimation task. First, we study the
rendering quality, and find that a small number of high-quality images is
superior to a large number of low-quality images. Second, we study the type of

                    <span>3D object detection is a core component of automated driving systems.
State-of-the-art methods fuse RGB imagery and LiDAR point cloud data
frame-by-frame for 3D bounding box regression. However, frame-by-frame 3D
object detection suffers from noise, field-of-view obstruction, and sparsity.
We propose a novel Temporal Fusion Module (TFM) to use information from
previous time-steps to mitigate these problems. First, a state-of-the-art
frustum network extracts point cloud features from raw RGB and LiDAR point
cloud data frame-by-frame. Then, our TFM module fuses these features with a
recurrent neural network. As a result, 3D object detection becomes robust
against single frame failures and transient occlusions. Experiments on the
KITTI object tracking dataset show the efficiency of the proposed TFM, where we
obtain ~6%, ~4%, and ~6% improvements on Car, Pedestrian, and Cyclist classes,
respectively, compared to frame-by-frame baselines. Furthermore, ablation
studies reinforce that the subject of improvement is temporal fusion and show
the effects of different placements of TFM in the object detection pipeline.

image, and are of primary significance to applications such as image matching
and motion analysis. Previous event-based feature extraction methods are mainly
focused on corners, which mainly find their locations, however, ignoring the
geometrical structure information like orientations and scales of edges. This
paper adapts the frame-based a-contrario junction detector(ACJ) to event data,
proposing the event-based a-contrario junction detector(e-ACJ), which yields
junctions&#x27; locations while giving the scales and orientations of their
branches. The proposed method relies on an a-contrario model and can operate on
asynchronous events directly without generating synthesized event frames. We
evaluate the performance on public event datasets. The result shows our method
successfully finds the orientations and scales of branches, while maintaining
high accuracy in junction&#x27;s location.</span>

                    <span>We address the problem of exposure correction of dark, blurry and noisy
images captured in low-light conditions in the wild. Classical image-denoising
filters work well in the frequency space but are constrained by several factors
such as the correct choice of thresholds, frequency estimates etc. On the other
hand, traditional deep networks are trained end-to-end in the RGB space by
formulating this task as an image-translation problem. However, that is done
without any explicit constraints on the inherent noise of the dark images and
thus produce noisy and blurry outputs. To this end we propose a DCT/FFT based
multi-scale loss function, which when combined with traditional losses, trains
a network to translate the important features for visually pleasing output. Our
loss function is end-to-end differentiable, scale-agnostic, and generic; i.e.,
it can be applied to both RAW and JPEG images in most existing frameworks
without additional overhead. Using this loss function, we report significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art using quantitative metrics and
subjective tests.</span>

                    <span>Deep learning using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has been shown to
significantly out-performed many conventional vision algorithms. Despite
efforts to increase the CNN efficiency both algorithmically and with
specialized hardware, deep learning remains difficult to deploy in
resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end
framework to explore optically compute the CNNs in free-space, much like a
computational camera. Compared to existing free-space optics-based approaches
which are limited to processing single-channel (i.e., grayscale) inputs, we
propose the first general approach, based on nanoscale meta-surface optics,
that can process RGB data directly from the natural scenes. Our system achieves
up to an order of magnitude energy saving, simplifies the sensor design, all
the while sacrificing little network accuracy.</span>

                    <span>Real-time detection of objects in the 3D scene is one of the tasks an
autonomous agent needs to perform for understanding its surroundings. While
recent Deep Learning-based solutions achieve satisfactory performance, their
high computational cost renders their application in real-life settings in
which computations need to be performed on embedded platforms intractable. In
this paper, we analyze the efficiency of two popular voxel-based 3D object
detection methods providing a good compromise between high performance and
speed based on two aspects, their ability to detect objects located at large
distances from the agent and their ability to operate in real time on embedded
platforms equipped with high-performance GPUs. Our experiments show that these
methods mostly fail to detect distant small objects due to the sparsity of the
input point clouds at large distances. Moreover, models trained on near objects
achieve similar or better performance compared to those trained on all objects
in the scene. This means that the models learn object appearance
representations mostly from near objects. Our findings suggest that a
considerable part of the computations of existing methods is focused on
locations of the scene that do not contribute with successful detection. This
means that the methods can achieve a speed-up of $40$-$60\%$ by restricting
operation to near objects while not sacrificing much in performance.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we present an efficient and robust deep learning solution for
novel view synthesis of complex scenes. In our approach, a 3D scene is
represented as a light field, i.e., a set of rays, each of which has a
corresponding color when reaching the image plane. For efficient novel view
rendering, we adopt a 4D parameterization of the light field, where each ray is
characterized by a 4D parameter. We then formulate the light field as a 4D
function that maps 4D coordinates to corresponding color values. We train a
deep fully connected network to optimize this implicit function and memorize
the 3D scene. Then, the scene-specific model is used to synthesize novel views.
Different from previous light field approaches which require dense view
sampling to reliably render novel views, our method can render novel views by
sampling rays and querying the color for each ray from the network directly,
thus enabling high-quality light field rendering with a sparser set of training
images. Our method achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis results while
maintaining an interactive frame rate.</span>

                    <span>In this work, we propose a data-driven scheme to initialize the parameters of
a deep neural network. This is in contrast to traditional approaches which
randomly initialize parameters by sampling from transformed standard
distributions. Such methods do not use the training data to produce a more
informed initialization. Our method uses a sequential layer-wise approach where
each layer is initialized using its input activations. The initialization is
cast as an optimization problem where we minimize a combination of encoding and
decoding losses of the input activations, which is further constrained by a
user-defined latent code. The optimization problem is then restructured into
the well-known Sylvester equation, which has fast and efficient gradient-free
solutions. Our data-driven method achieves a boost in performance compared to
random initialization methods, both before start of training and after training
is over. We show that our proposed method is especially effective in few-shot
and fine-tuning settings. We conclude this paper with analyses on time
complexity and the effect of different latent codes on the recognition
performance.</span>

                    <span>The problem of knowledge-based visual question answering involves answering
questions that require external knowledge in addition to the content of the
image. Such knowledge typically comes in a variety of forms, including visual,
textual, and commonsense knowledge. The use of more knowledge sources, however,
also increases the chance of retrieving more irrelevant or noisy facts, making
it difficult to comprehend the facts and find the answer. To address this
challenge, we propose Multi-modal Answer Validation using External knowledge
(MAVEx), where the idea is to validate a set of promising answer candidates
based on answer-specific knowledge retrieval. This is in contrast to existing
approaches that search for the answer in a vast collection of often irrelevant
facts. Our approach aims to learn which knowledge source should be trusted for
each answer candidate and how to validate the candidate using that source. We
consider a multi-modal setting, relying on both textual and visual knowledge
resources, including images searched using Google, sentences from Wikipedia
articles, and concepts from ConceptNet. Our experiments with OK-VQA, a
challenging knowledge-based VQA dataset, demonstrate that MAVEx achieves new
state-of-the-art results.</span>

                    <span>The popularity of multimodal sensors and the accessibility of the Internet
have brought us a massive amount of unlabeled multimodal data. Since existing
datasets and well-trained models are primarily unimodal, the modality gap
between a unimodal network and unlabeled multimodal data poses an interesting
problem: how to transfer a pre-trained unimodal network to perform the same
task on unlabeled multimodal data? In this work, we propose multimodal
knowledge expansion (MKE), a knowledge distillation-based framework to
effectively utilize multimodal data without requiring labels. Opposite to
traditional knowledge distillation, where the student is designed to be
lightweight and inferior to the teacher, we observe that a multimodal student
model consistently denoises pseudo labels and generalizes better than its
teacher. Extensive experiments on four tasks and different modalities verify
this finding. Furthermore, we connect the mechanism of MKE to semi-supervised
learning and offer both empirical and theoretical explanations to understand
the denoising capability of a multimodal student.</span>

                    <span>An effective 3D descriptor should be invariant to different geometric
transformations, such as scale and rotation, repeatable in the case of
occlusions and clutter, and generalisable in different contexts when data is
captured with different sensors. We present a simple but yet effective method
to learn generalisable and distinctive 3D local descriptors that can be used to
register point clouds captured in different contexts with different sensors.
Point cloud patches are extracted, canonicalised with respect to their local
reference frame, and encoded into scale and rotation-invariant compact
descriptors by a point permutation-invariant deep neural network. Our
descriptors can effectively generalise across sensor modalities from locally
and randomly sampled points. We evaluate and compare our descriptors with
alternative handcrafted and deep learning-based descriptors on several indoor
and outdoor datasets reconstructed using both RGBD sensors and laser scanners.
Our descriptors outperform most recent descriptors by a large margin in terms
of generalisation, and become the state of the art also in benchmarks where
training and testing are performed in the same scenarios.</span>

                    <span>Automatic segmentation of magnetic resonance (MR) images is crucial for
morphological evaluation of the pediatric musculoskeletal system in clinical
practice. However, the accuracy and generalization performance of individual
segmentation models are limited due to the restricted amount of annotated
pediatric data. Hence, we propose to train a segmentation model on multiple
datasets, arising from different parts of the anatomy, in a multi-task and
multi-domain learning framework. This approach allows to overcome the inherent
scarcity of pediatric data while benefiting from a more robust shared
representation. The proposed segmentation network comprises shared
convolutional filters, domain-specific batch normalization parameters that
compute the respective dataset statistics and a domain-specific segmentation
layer. Furthermore, a supervised contrastive regularization is integrated to
further improve generalization capabilities, by promoting intra-domain
similarity and impose inter-domain margins in embedded space. We evaluate our
contributions on two pediatric imaging datasets of the ankle and shoulder
joints for bone segmentation. Results demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</span>

                    <span>Hidden features in neural network usually fail to learn informative
representation for 3D segmentation as supervisions are only given on output
prediction, while this can be solved by omni-scale supervision on intermediate
layers. In this paper, we bring the first omni-scale supervision method to
point cloud segmentation via the proposed gradual Receptive Field Component
Reasoning (RFCR), where target Receptive Field Component Codes (RFCCs) are
designed to record categories within receptive fields for hidden units in the
encoder. Then, target RFCCs will supervise the decoder to gradually infer the
RFCCs in a coarse-to-fine categories reasoning manner, and finally obtain the
semantic labels. Because many hidden features are inactive with tiny magnitude
and make minor contributions to RFCC prediction, we propose a Feature
Densification with a centrifugal potential to obtain more unambiguous features,
and it is in effect equivalent to entropy regularization over features. More
active features can further unleash the potential of our omni-supervision
method. We embed our method into four prevailing backbones and test on three
challenging benchmarks. Our method can significantly improve the backbones in
all three datasets. Specifically, our method brings new state-of-the-art
performances for S3DIS as well as Semantic3D and ranks the 1st in the ScanNet
benchmark among all the point-based methods. Code will be publicly available at

                    <span>Transformer models have recently attracted much interest from computer vision
researchers and have since been successfully employed for several problems
traditionally addressed with convolutional neural networks. At the same time,
image synthesis using generative adversarial networks (GANs) has drastically
improved over the last few years. The recently proposed TransGAN is the first
GAN using only transformer-based architectures and achieves competitive results
when compared to convolutional GANs. However, since transformers are
data-hungry architectures, TransGAN requires data augmentation, an auxiliary
super-resolution task during training, and a masking prior to guide the
self-attention mechanism. In this paper, we study the combination of a
transformer-based generator and convolutional discriminator and successfully
remove the need of the aforementioned required design choices. We evaluate our
approach by conducting a benchmark of well-known CNN discriminators, ablate the
size of the transformer-based generator, and show that combining both
architectural elements into a hybrid model leads to better results.
Furthermore, we investigate the frequency spectrum properties of generated
images and observe that our model retains the benefits of an attention based
generator.</span>

                    <span>This paper addresses the problem of reconstructing the surface shape of
transparent objects. The difficulty of this problem originates from the
viewpoint dependent appearance of a transparent object, which quickly makes
reconstruction methods tailored for diffuse surfaces fail disgracefully. In
this paper, we introduce a fixed viewpoint approach to dense surface
reconstruction of transparent objects based on refraction of light. We present
a simple setup that allows us to alter the incident light paths before light
rays enter the object by immersing the object partially in a liquid, and
develop a method for recovering the object surface through reconstructing and
triangulating such incident light paths. Our proposed approach does not need to
model the complex interactions of light as it travels through the object,
neither does it assume any parametric form for the object shape nor the exact
number of refractions and reflections taken place along the light paths. It can
therefore handle transparent objects with a relatively complex shape and
structure, with unknown and inhomogeneous refractive index. We also show that
for thin transparent objects, our proposed acquisition setup can be further
simplified by adopting a single refraction approximation. Experimental results
on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our
proposed approach.</span>

                    <span>Deep convolutional neural networks accuracy is heavily impacted by rotations
of the input data. In this paper, we propose a convolutional predictor that is
invariant to rotations in the input. This architecture is capable of predicting
the angular orientation without angle-annotated data. Furthermore, the
predictor maps continuously the random rotation of the input to a circular
space of the prediction. For this purpose, we use the roto-translation
properties existing in the Scattering Transform Networks with a series of 3D
Convolutions. We validate the results by training with upright and randomly
rotated samples. This allows further applications of this work on fields like
automatic re-orientation of randomly oriented datasets.</span>

                    <span>This paper presents a novel algorithm that registers a collection of
mono-modal 3D images in a simultaneous fashion, named as Direct Simultaneous
Registration (DSR). The algorithm optimizes global poses of local frames
directly based on the intensities of images (without extracting features from
the images). To obtain the optimal result, we start with formulating a Direct
Bundle Adjustment (DBA) problem which jointly optimizes pose parameters of
local frames and intensities of panoramic image. By proving the independence of
the pose from panoramic image in the iterative process, DSR is proposed and
proved to be able to generate the same optimal poses as DBA, but without
optimizing the intensities of the panoramic image. The proposed DSR method is
particularly suitable in mono-modal registration and in the scenarios where
distinct features are not available, such as Transesophageal Echocardiography
(TEE) images. The proposed method is validated via simulated and in-vivo 3D TEE
images. It is shown that the proposed method outperforms conventional
sequential registration method in terms of accuracy and the obtained results
can produce good alignment in in-vivo images.</span>

                    <span>Intrinsic Image Decomposition is an open problem of generating the
constituents of an image. Generating reflectance and shading from a single
image is a challenging task specifically when there is no ground truth. There
is a lack of unsupervised learning approaches for decomposing an image into
reflectance and shading using a single image. We propose a neural network
architecture capable of this decomposition using physics-based parameters
derived from the image. Through experimental results, we show that (a) the
proposed methodology outperforms the existing deep learning-based IID
techniques and (b) the derived parameters improve the efficacy significantly.
We conclude with a closer analysis of the results (numerical and example
images) showing several avenues for improvement.</span>

can accept either video or text input, or both for a variety of end tasks.
Existing pre-training are task-specific by adopting either a single cross-modal
encoder that requires both modalities, limiting their use for retrieval-style
end tasks or more complex multitask learning with two unimodal encoders,
limiting early cross-modal fusion. We instead introduce new pretraining masking
schemes that better mix across modalities (e.g. by forcing masks for text to
predict the closest video embeddings) while also maintaining separability (e.g.
unimodal predictions are sometimes required, without using all the input).
Experimental results show strong performance across a wider range of tasks than

                    <span>Story visualization is an under-explored task that falls at the intersection
of many important research directions in both computer vision and natural
language processing. In this task, given a series of natural language captions
which compose a story, an agent must generate a sequence of images that
correspond to the captions. Prior work has introduced recurrent generative
models which outperform text-to-image synthesis models on this task. However,
there is room for improvement of generated images in terms of visual quality,
coherence and relevance. We present a number of improvements to prior modeling
approaches, including (1) the addition of a dual learning framework that
utilizes video captioning to reinforce the semantic alignment between the story
and generated images, (2) a copy-transform mechanism for
sequentially-consistent story visualization, and (3) MART-based transformers to
model complex interactions between frames. We present ablation studies to
demonstrate the effect of each of these techniques on the generative power of
the model for both individual images as well as the entire narrative.
Furthermore, due to the complexity and generative nature of the task, standard
evaluation metrics do not accurately reflect performance. Therefore, we also
provide an exploration of evaluation metrics for the model, focused on aspects
of the generated frames such as the presence/quality of generated characters,
the relevance to captions, and the diversity of the generated images. We also
present correlation experiments of our proposed automated metrics with human
evaluations. Code and data available at:

                    <span>Large scale image classification datasets often contain noisy labels. We take
a principled probabilistic approach to modelling input-dependent, also known as
heteroscedastic, label noise in these datasets. We place a multivariate Normal
distributed latent variable on the final hidden layer of a neural network
classifier. The covariance matrix of this latent variable, models the aleatoric
uncertainty due to label noise. We demonstrate that the learned covariance
structure captures known sources of label noise between semantically similar
and co-occurring classes. Compared to standard neural network training and
other baselines, we show significantly improved accuracy on Imagenet ILSVRC
2012 79.3% (+2.6%), Imagenet-21k 47.0% (+1.1%) and JFT 64.7% (+1.6%). We set a
new state-of-the-art result on WebVision 1.0 with 76.6% top-1 accuracy. These
datasets range from over 1M to over 300M training examples and from 1k classes
to more than 21k classes. Our method is simple to use, and we provide an
implementation that is a drop-in replacement for the final fully-connected
layer in a deep classifier.</span>

                    <span>Image classification methods are usually trained to perform predictions
taking into account a predefined group of known classes. Real-world problems,
however, may not allow for a full knowledge of the input and label spaces,
making failures in recognition a hazard to deep visual learning. Open set
recognition methods are characterized by the ability to correctly identifying
inputs of known and unknown classes. In this context, we propose GeMOS: simple
and plug-and-play open set recognition modules that can be attached to
pretrained Deep Neural Networks for visual recognition. The GeMOS framework
pairs pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks with generative models for open
set recognition to extract open set scores for each sample, allowing for
failure recognition in object recognition tasks. We conduct a thorough
evaluation of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art open set
algorithms, finding that GeMOS either outperforms or is statistically
indistinguishable from more complex and costly models.</span>

                    <span>Orthopedic disorders are a common cause for euthanasia among horses, which
often could have been avoided with earlier detection. These conditions often
create varying degrees of subtle but long-term pain. It is challenging to train
a visual pain recognition method with video data depicting such pain, since the
resulting pain behavior also is subtle, sparsely appearing, and varying, making
it challenging for even an expert human labeler to provide accurate
ground-truth for the data. We show that transferring features from a dataset of
horses with acute nociceptive pain (where labeling is less ambiguous) can aid
the learning to recognize more complex orthopedic pain. Moreover, we present a
human expert baseline for the problem, as well as an extensive empirical study
of various domain transfer methods and of what is detected by the pain
recognition method trained on acute pain in the orthopedic dataset. Finally,
this is accompanied with a discussion around the challenges posed by real-world
animal behavior datasets and how best practices can be established for similar
fine-grained action recognition tasks. Our code is available at

                    <span>The task of predicting smooth and edge-consistent depth maps is notoriously
difficult for single image depth estimation. This paper proposes a novel
Bilateral Grid based 3D convolutional neural network, dubbed as 3DBG-UNet, that
parameterizes high dimensional feature space by encoding compact 3D bilateral
grids with UNets and infers sharp geometric layout of the scene. Further,
another novel 3DBGES-UNet model is introduced that integrate 3DBG-UNet for
inferring an accurate depth map given a single color view. The 3DBGES-UNet
concatenates 3DBG-UNet geometry map with the inception network edge
accentuation map and a spatial object&#x27;s boundary map obtained by leveraging
semantic segmentation and train the UNet model with ResNet backbone. Both
models are designed with a particular attention to explicitly account for edges
or minute details. Preserving sharp discontinuities at depth edges is critical
for many applications such as realistic integration of virtual objects in AR
video or occlusion-aware view synthesis for 3D display applications.The
proposed depth prediction network achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the challenging NYUv2-Depth data.

                    <span>Over the last few decades, Lung Ultrasound (LUS) has been increasingly used
to diagnose and monitor different lung diseases in neonates. It is a non
invasive tool that allows a fast bedside examination while minimally handling
the neonate. Acquiring a LUS scan is easy, but understanding the artifacts
concerned with each respiratory disease is challenging. Mixed artifact patterns
found in different respiratory diseases may limit LUS readability by the
operator. While machine learning (ML), especially deep learning can assist in
automated analysis, simply feeding the ultrasound images to an ML model for
diagnosis is not enough to earn the trust of medical professionals. The
algorithm should output LUS features that are familiar to the operator instead.
Therefore, in this paper we present a unique approach for extracting seven
meaningful LUS features that can be easily associated with a specific
pathological lung condition: Normal pleura, irregular pleura, thick pleura,
Alines, Coalescent B-lines, Separate B-lines and Consolidations. These
artifacts can lead to early prediction of infants developing later respiratory
distress symptoms. A single multi-class region proposal-based object detection
model faster-RCNN (fRCNN) was trained on lower posterior lung ultrasound videos
to detect these LUS features which are further linked to four common neonatal
diseases. Our results show that fRCNN surpasses single stage models such as
RetinaNet and can successfully detect the aforementioned LUS features with a
mean average precision of 86.4%. Instead of a fully automatic diagnosis from
images without any interpretability, detection of such LUS features leave the
ultimate control of diagnosis to the clinician, which can result in a more
trustworthy intelligent system.</span>

                    <span>Face recognition has achieved significant progress in deep-learning era due
to the ultra-large-scale and well-labeled datasets. However, training on
ultra-large-scale datasets is time-consuming and takes up a lot of hardware
resource. Therefore, how to design an appropriate training approach is very
crucial and indispensable. The computational and hardware cost of training
ultra-large-scale datasets mainly focuses on the Fully-Connected (FC) layer
rather than convolutional layers. To this end, we propose a novel training
approach for ultra-large-scale face datasets, termed Faster Face Classification
(F$^2$C). In F$^2$C, we first define a Gallery Net and a Probe Net that are
used to generate identities&#x27; centers and extract faces&#x27; features for face
recognition, respectively. Gallery Net has the same structure as Probe Net and
inherits the parameters from Probe Net with a moving average paradigm. After
that, to reduce the training time and hardware resource occupancy of the FC
layer, we propose the Dynamic Class Pool that stores the features from Gallery
Net and calculates the inner product (logits) with positive samples (its
identities appear in Dynamic Class Pool) in each mini-batch. Dynamic Class Pool
can be regarded as a substitute for the FC layer and its size is much smaller
than FC, which is the reason why Dynamic Class Pool can largely reduce the time
and resource cost. For negative samples (its identities are not appear in the
Dynamic Class Pool), we minimize the cosine similarities between negative
samples and Dynamic Class Pool. Then, to improve the update efficiency and
speed of Dynamic Class Pool&#x27;s parameters, we design the Dual Loaders including
Identity-based and Instance-based Loaders. Dual Loaders load images from given
dataset by instances and identities to generate batches for training.</span>

                    <span>Covid-19 global pandemic continues to devastate health care systems across
the world. In many countries, the 2nd wave is very severe. Economical and rapid
testing, as well as diagnosis, is urgently needed to control the pandemic. At
present, the Covid-19 testing is costly and time-consuming. Chest X-Ray (CXR)
testing can be the fastest, scalable, and non-invasive method. The existing
methods suffer due to the limited CXR samples available from Covid-19. Thus,
inspired by the limitations of the open-source work in this field, we propose
attention guided contrastive CNN architecture (AC-CovidNet) for Covid-19
detection in CXR images. The proposed method learns the robust and
discriminative features with the help of contrastive loss. Moreover, the
proposed method gives more importance to the infected regions as guided by the
attention mechanism. We compute the sensitivity of the proposed method over the
publicly available Covid-19 dataset. It is observed that the proposed
AC-CovidNet exhibits very promising performance as compared to the existing
methods even with limited training data. It can tackle the bottleneck of CXR
Covid-19 datasets being faced by the researchers. The code used in this paper

                    <span>In image anomaly detection, Autoencoders are the popular methods that
reconstruct the input image that might contain anomalies and output a clean
image with no abnormalities. These Autoencoder-based methods usually calculate
the anomaly score from the reconstruction error, the difference between the
input image and the reconstructed image. On the other hand, the accuracy of the
reconstruction is insufficient in many of these methods, so it leads to
degraded accuracy of anomaly detection. To improve the accuracy of the
reconstruction, we consider defining loss function in the frequency domain. In
general, we know that natural images contain many low-frequency components and
few high-frequency components. Hence, to improve the accuracy of the
reconstruction of high-frequency components, we introduce a new loss function
named weighted frequency domain loss(WFDL). WFDL provides a sharper
reconstructed image, which contributes to improving the accuracy of anomaly
detection. In this paper, we show our method&#x27;s superiority over the
conventional Autoencoder methods by comparing it with AUROC on the MVTec AD

                    <span>Mammogram mass detection is crucial for diagnosing and preventing the breast
cancers in clinical practice. The complementary effect of multi-view mammogram
images provides valuable information about the breast anatomical prior
structure and is of great significance in digital mammography interpretation.
However, unlike radiologists who can utilize the natural reasoning ability to
identify masses based on multiple mammographic views, how to endow the existing
object detection models with the capability of multi-view reasoning is vital
for decision-making in clinical diagnosis but remains the boundary to explore.
In this paper, we propose an Anatomy-aware Graph convolutional Network (AGN),
which is tailored for mammogram mass detection and endows existing detection
methods with multi-view reasoning ability. The proposed AGN consists of three
steps. Firstly, we introduce a Bipartite Graph convolutional Network (BGN) to
model the intrinsic geometric and semantic relations of ipsilateral views.
Secondly, considering that the visual asymmetry of bilateral views is widely
adopted in clinical practice to assist the diagnosis of breast lesions, we
propose an Inception Graph convolutional Network (IGN) to model the structural
similarities of bilateral views. Finally, based on the constructed graphs, the
multi-view information is propagated through nodes methodically, which equips
the features learned from the examined view with multi-view reasoning ability.
Experiments on two standard benchmarks reveal that AGN significantly exceeds
the state-of-the-art performance. Visualization results show that AGN provides
interpretable visual cues for clinical diagnosis.</span>

                    <span>3D human pose estimation is a difficult task, due to challenges such as
occluded body parts and ambiguous poses. Graph convolutional networks encode
the structural information of the human skeleton in the form of an adjacency
matrix, which is beneficial for better pose prediction. We propose one such
graph convolutional network named PoseGraphNet for 3D human pose regression
from 2D poses. Our network uses an adaptive adjacency matrix and kernels
specific to neighbor groups. We evaluate our model on the Human3.6M dataset
which is a standard dataset for 3D pose estimation. Our model&#x27;s performance is
close to the state-of-the-art, but with much fewer parameters. The model learns
interesting adjacency relations between joints that have no physical
connections, but are behaviorally similar.</span>

performance on benchmark metrics. We resolve this problem by introducing a

single-head attention model helps limit the negative impact of noise by
learning visual representations at different segment scales. AttU-Net shows
better unsupervised MOT tracking performance over variational inference-based

                    <span>Pelvic ring disruptions result from blunt injury mechanisms and are often
found in patients with multi-system trauma. To grade pelvic fracture severity
in trauma victims based on whole-body CT, the Tile AO/OTA classification is
frequently used. Due to the high volume of whole-body trauma CTs generated in
busy trauma centers, an automated approach to Tile classification would provide
substantial value, e.,g., to prioritize the reading queue of the attending
trauma radiologist. In such scenario, an automated method should perform
grading based on a transparent process and based on interpretable features to
enable interaction with human readers and lower their workload by offering
insights from a first automated read of the scan. This paper introduces an
automated yet interpretable pelvic trauma decision support system to assist
radiologists in fracture detection and Tile grade classification. The method
operates similarly to human interpretation of CT scans and first detects
distinct pelvic fractures on CT with high specificity using a Faster-RCNN model
that are then interpreted using a structural causal model based on clinical
best practices to infer an initial Tile grade. The Bayesian causal model and
finally, the object detector are then queried for likely co-occurring fractures
that may have been rejected initially due to the highly specific operating
point of the detector, resulting in an updated list of detected fractures and
corresponding final Tile grade. Our method is transparent in that it provides
finding location and type using the object detector, as well as information on
important counterfactuals that would invalidate the system&#x27;s recommendation and
achieves an AUC of 83.3%/85.1% for translational/rotational instability.
Despite being designed for human-machine teaming, our approach does not
compromise on performance compared to previous black-box approaches.</span>

transmission maps at each level to recover a high-quality haze-free image.
Experiments on RESIDE SOTS show that PF-DCP not only outperforms the
traditional prior-based methods with a large margin but also achieves
comparable or even better results of state-of-art deep learning approaches.
Furthermore, the visual quality is also greatly improved with much fewer color

                    <span>Domain shift has always been one of the primary issues in video object
segmentation (VOS), for which models suffer from degeneration when tested on
unfamiliar datasets. Recently, many online methods have emerged to narrow the
performance gap between training data (source domain) and test data (target
domain) by fine-tuning on annotations of test data which are usually in
shortage. In this paper, we propose a novel method to tackle domain shift by
first introducing adversarial domain adaptation to the VOS task, with
supervised training on the source domain and unsupervised training on the
target domain. By fusing appearance and motion features with a convolution
layer, and by adding supervision onto the motion branch, our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DAVIS2016 with 82.6% mean IoU score after
supervised training. Meanwhile, our adversarial domain adaptation strategy
significantly raises the performance of the trained model when applied on
FBMS59 and Youtube-Object, without exploiting extra annotations.</span>

                    <span>Owing to the difficulties of mining spatial-temporal cues, the existing
approaches for video salient object detection (VSOD) are limited in
understanding complex and noisy scenarios, and often fail in inferring
prominent objects. To alleviate such shortcomings, we propose a simple yet
efficient architecture, termed Guidance and Teaching Network (GTNet), to
independently distil effective spatial and temporal cues with implicit guidance
and explicit teaching at feature- and decision-level, respectively. To be
specific, we (a) introduce a temporal modulator to implicitly bridge features
from motion into the appearance branch, which is capable of fusing cross-modal
features collaboratively, and (b) utilise motion-guided mask to propagate the
explicit cues during the feature aggregation. This novel learning strategy
achieves satisfactory results via decoupling the complex spatial-temporal cues
and mapping informative cues across different modalities. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks show that the proposed method can run at ~28
fps on a single TITAN Xp GPU and perform competitively against 14 cutting-edge
baselines.</span>

                    <span>Few-shot learning (FSL) is the task of learning to recognize previously
unseen categories of images from a small number of training examples. This is a
challenging task, as the available examples may not be enough to unambiguously
determine which visual features are most characteristic of the considered
categories. To alleviate this issue, we propose a method that additionally
takes into account the names of the image classes. While the use of class names
has already been explored in previous work, our approach differs in two key
aspects. First, while previous work has aimed to directly predict visual
prototypes from word embeddings, we found that better results can be obtained
by treating visual and text-based prototypes separately. Second, we propose a
simple strategy for learning class name embeddings using the BERT language
model, which we found to substantially outperform the GloVe vectors that were
used in previous work. We furthermore propose a strategy for dealing with the
high dimensionality of these vectors, inspired by models for aligning
cross-lingual word embeddings. We provide experiments on miniImageNet, CUB and
tieredImageNet, showing that our approach consistently improves the
state-of-the-art in metric-based FSL.</span>

                    <span>Deep learning has shown a great improvement in the performance of visual
tasks. Image retrieval is the task of extracting the visually similar images
from a database for a query image. The feature matching is performed to rank
the images. Various hand-designed features have been derived in past to
represent the images. Nowadays, the power of deep learning is being utilized
for automatic feature learning from data in the field of biomedical image
analysis. Autoencoder and Siamese networks are two deep learning models to
learn the latent space (i.e., features or embedding). Autoencoder works based
on the reconstruction of the image from latent space. Siamese network utilizes
the triplets to learn the intra-class similarity and inter-class dissimilarity.
Moreover, Autoencoder is unsupervised, whereas Siamese network is supervised.
We propose a Joint Triplet Autoencoder Network (JTANet) by facilitating the
triplet learning in autoencoder framework. A joint supervised learning for
Siamese network and unsupervised learning for Autoencoder is performed.
Moreover, the Encoder network of Autoencoder is shared with Siamese network and
referred as the Siamcoder network. The features are extracted by using the
trained Siamcoder network for retrieval purpose. The experiments are performed
over Histopathological Routine Colon Cancer dataset. We have observed the
promising performance using the proposed JTANet model against the Autoencoder

images.</span>

                    <span>Many efforts have been devoted to designing sampling, mining, and weighting
strategies in high-level deep metric learning (DML) loss objectives. However,
little attention has been paid to low-level but essential data transformation.
In this paper, we develop a novel mechanism, the independent domain embedding
augmentation learning ({IDEAL}) method. It can simultaneously learn multiple
independent embedding spaces for multiple domains generated by predefined data
transformations. Our IDEAL is orthogonal to existing DML techniques and can be
seamlessly combined with prior DML approaches for enhanced performance.
Empirical results on visual retrieval tasks demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method. For example, the IDEAL improves the performance of MS loss by
a large margin, 84.5\% $\rightarrow$ 87.1\% on Cars-196, and 65.8\%
$\rightarrow$ 69.5\% on CUB-200 at Recall$@1$. Our IDEAL with MS loss also
achieves the new state-of-the-art performance on three image retrieval
benchmarks, \ie, \emph{Cars-196}, \emph{CUB-200}, and \emph{SOP}. It
outperforms the most recent DML approaches, such as Circle loss and XBM,

                    <span>Over the past decades, enormous efforts have been made to improve the
performance of linear or nonlinear mixing models for hyperspectral unmixing,
yet their ability to simultaneously generalize various spectral variabilities
and extract physically meaningful endmembers still remains limited due to the
poor ability in data fitting and reconstruction and the sensitivity to various
spectral variabilities. Inspired by the powerful learning ability of deep
learning, we attempt to develop a general deep learning approach for
hyperspectral unmixing, by fully considering the properties of endmembers
extracted from the hyperspectral imagery, called endmember-guided unmixing
network (EGU-Net). Beyond the alone autoencoder-like architecture, EGU-Net is a
two-stream Siamese deep network, which learns an additional network from the
pure or nearly-pure endmembers to correct the weights of another unmixing
network by sharing network parameters and adding spectrally meaningful
constraints (e.g., non-negativity and sum-to-one) towards a more accurate and
interpretable unmixing solution. Furthermore, the resulting general framework
is not only limited to pixel-wise spectral unmixing but also applicable to
spatial information modeling with convolutional operators for spatial-spectral
unmixing. Experimental results conducted on three different datasets with the
ground-truth of abundance maps corresponding to each material demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of the EGU-Net over state-of-the-art unmixing
algorithms. The codes will be available from the website:

                    <span>In the race to bring Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the edge, collaborative
intelligence has emerged as a promising way to lighten the computation load on
edge devices that run applications based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).
Typically, a deep model is split at a certain layer into edge and cloud
sub-models. The deep feature tensor produced by the edge sub-model is
transmitted to the cloud, where the remaining computationally intensive
workload is performed by the cloud sub-model. The communication channel between
the edge and cloud is imperfect, which will result in missing data in the deep
feature tensor received at the cloud side. In this study, we examine the
effectiveness of four low-rank tensor completion methods in recovering missing
data in the deep feature tensor. We consider both sparse tensors, such as those
produced by the VGG16 model, as well as non-sparse tensors, such as those
produced by ResNet34 model. We study tensor completion effectiveness in both
conplexity-constrained and unconstrained scenario.</span>

                    <span>As remote sensing (RS) data obtained from different sensors become available
largely and openly, multimodal data processing and analysis techniques have
been garnering increasing interest in the RS and geoscience community. However,
due to the gap between different modalities in terms of imaging sensors,
resolutions, and contents, embedding their complementary information into a
consistent, compact, accurate, and discriminative representation, to a great
extent, remains challenging. To this end, we propose a shared and specific
feature learning (S2FL) model. S2FL is capable of decomposing multimodal RS
data into modality-shared and modality-specific components, enabling the
information blending of multi-modalities more effectively, particularly for
heterogeneous data sources. Moreover, to better assess multimodal baselines and
the newly-proposed S2FL model, three multimodal RS benchmark datasets, i.e.,
Houston2013 -- hyperspectral and multispectral data, Berlin -- hyperspectral
and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, Augsburg -- hyperspectral, SAR, and
digital surface model (DSM) data, are released and used for land cover
classification. Extensive experiments conducted on the three datasets
demonstrate the superiority and advancement of our S2FL model in the task of
land cover classification in comparison with previously-proposed
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, the baseline codes and datasets used
in this paper will be made available freely at

                    <span>Cancelable biometric techniques have been used to prevent the compromise of
biometric data by generating and using their corresponding cancelable templates
for user authentication. However, the non-invertible distance preserving
transformation methods employed in various schemes are often vulnerable to
information leakage since matching is performed in the transformed domain. In
this paper, we propose a non-invertible distance preserving scheme based on
vector permutation and shift-order process. First, the dimension of feature
vectors is reduced using kernelized principle component analysis (KPCA) prior
to randomly permuting the extracted vector features. A shift-order process is
then applied to the generated features in order to achieve non-invertibility
and combat similarity-based attacks. The generated hash codes are resilient to
different security and privacy attacks whilst fulfilling the major revocability
and unlinkability requirements. Experimental evaluation conducted on 6 datasets
of FVC2002 and FVC2004 reveals a high-performance accuracy of the proposed
scheme better than other existing state-of-the-art schemes.</span>

of symbol segmentation, symbol recognition and relation classification in
online handwritten mathematical expressions (HMEs). The classification model is
trained by multiple paths of symbols and spatial relations derived from the
Symbol Relation Tree (SRT) representation of HMEs. The method benefits from
global context of a deep bidirectional Long Short-term Memory network, which
learns the temporal classification directly from online handwriting by the
Connectionist Temporal Classification loss. To recognize an online HME, a
symbol-level parse tree with Context-Free Grammar is constructed, where symbols

robustness metrics specialized for semantic segmentation. The novelty of our
proposal is to move beyond pixel-level metrics: Given two images with each
having N pixels being class-flipped, the designed metrics should, depending on
the clustering of pixels being class-flipped or the location of occurrence,
reflect a different level of safety criticality. The result evaluated on an

                    <span>Single-Image Super Resolution (SISR) is a classical computer vision problem
and it has been studied for over decades. With the recent success of deep
learning methods, recent work on SISR focuses solutions with deep learning
methodologies and achieves state-of-the-art results. However most of the
state-of-the-art SISR methods contain millions of parameters and layers, which
limits their practical applications. In this paper, we propose a hardware
(Synaptics Dolphin NPU) limitation aware, extremely lightweight quantization
robust real-time super resolution network (XLSR). The proposed model&#x27;s building
block is inspired from root modules for Image classification. We successfully
applied root modules to SISR problem, further more to make the model uint8
quantization robust we used Clipped ReLU at the last layer of the network and
achieved great balance between reconstruction quality and runtime. Furthermore,
although the proposed network contains 30x fewer parameters than VDSR its
performance surpasses it on Div2K validation set. The network proved itself by
winning Mobile AI 2021 Real-Time Single Image Super Resolution Challenge.</span>

                    <span>Scale variation is one of the most challenging problems in face detection.
Modern face detectors employ feature pyramids to deal with scale variation.
However, it might break the feature consistency across different scales of
faces. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method named the
receptive field pyramids (RFP) method to enhance the representation ability of
feature pyramids. It can learn different receptive fields in each feature map
adaptively based on the varying scales of detected faces. Empirical results on
two face detection benchmark datasets, i.e., WIDER FACE and UFDD, demonstrate
that our proposed method can accelerate the inference rate significantly while
achieving state-of-the-art performance. The source code of our method is

                    <span>There has been a widely held view that visual representations (e.g.,
photographs and illustrations) do not depict negation, for example, one that
can be expressed by a sentence &quot;the train is not coming&quot;. This view is
empirically challenged by analyzing the real-world visual representations of
comic (manga) illustrations. In the experiment using image captioning tasks, we
gave people comic illustrations and asked them to explain what they could read
from them. The collected data showed that some comic illustrations could depict
negation without any aid of sequences (multiple panels) or conventional devices
(special symbols). This type of comic illustrations was subjected to further
experiments, classifying images into those containing negation and those not
containing negation. While this image classification was easy for humans, it
was difficult for data-driven machines, i.e., deep learning models (CNN), to
achieve the same high performance. Given the findings, we argue that some comic
illustrations evoke background knowledge and thus can depict negation with
purely visual elements.</span>

                    <span>Large-scale unlabeled data has allowed recent progress in self-supervised
learning methods that learn rich visual representations. State-of-the-art
self-supervised methods for learning representations from images (MoCo and
BYOL) use an inductive bias that different augmentations (e.g. random crops) of
an image should produce similar embeddings. We show that such methods are
vulnerable to backdoor attacks where an attacker poisons a part of the
unlabeled data by adding a small trigger (known to the attacker) to the images.
The model performance is good on clean test images but the attacker can
manipulate the decision of the model by showing the trigger at test time.
Backdoor attacks have been studied extensively in supervised learning and to
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study them for self-supervised
learning. Backdoor attacks are more practical in self-supervised learning since
the unlabeled data is large and as a result, an inspection of the data to avoid
the presence of poisoned data is prohibitive. We show that in our targeted
attack, the attacker can produce many false positives for the target category
by using the trigger at test time. We also propose a knowledge distillation
based defense algorithm that succeeds in neutralizing the attack. Our code is
available here: https://github.com/UMBCvision/SSL-Backdoor .</span>

                    <span>Annotating images for semantic segmentation requires intense manual labor and
is a time-consuming and expensive task especially for domains with a scarcity
of experts, such as Forensic Anthropology. We leverage the evolving nature of
images depicting the decay process in human decomposition data to design a
simple yet effective pseudo-pixel-level label generation technique to reduce
the amount of effort for manual annotation of such images. We first identify
sequences of images with a minimum variation that are most suitable to share
the same or similar annotation using an unsupervised approach. Given one
user-annotated image in each sequence, we propagate the annotation to the
remaining images in the sequence by merging it with annotations produced by a
state-of-the-art CAM-based pseudo label generation technique. To evaluate the
quality of our pseudo-pixel-level labels, we train two semantic segmentation
models with VGG and ResNet backbones on images labeled using our pseudo
labeling method and those of a state-of-the-art method. The results indicate
that using our pseudo-labels instead of those generated using the
state-of-the-art method in the training process improves the mean-IoU and the
frequency-weighted-IoU of the VGG and ResNet-based semantic segmentation models
by 3.36%, 2.58%, 10.39%, and 12.91% respectively.</span>

                    <span>Human pose estimation has achieved significant progress in recent years.
However, most of the recent methods focus on improving accuracy using
complicated models and ignoring real-time efficiency. To achieve a better
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we propose a novel neural
architecture search (NAS) method, termed ViPNAS, to search networks in both
spatial and temporal levels for fast online video pose estimation. In the
spatial level, we carefully design the search space with five different
dimensions including network depth, width, kernel size, group number, and
attentions. In the temporal level, we search from a series of temporal feature
fusions to optimize the total accuracy and speed across multiple video frames.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to search for the temporal
feature fusion and automatic computation allocation in videos. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging
COCO2017 and PoseTrack2018 datasets. Our discovered model family, S-ViPNAS and
T-ViPNAS, achieve significantly higher inference speed (CPU real-time) without
sacrificing the accuracy compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>Modeling powerful interactions is a critical challenge in Click-through rate
(CTR) prediction, which is one of the most typical machine learning tasks in
personalized advertising and recommender systems. Although developing
hand-crafted interactions is effective for a small number of datasets, it
generally requires laborious and tedious architecture engineering for extensive
scenarios. In recent years, several neural architecture search (NAS) methods
have been proposed for designing interactions automatically. However, existing
methods only explore limited types and connections of operators for interaction
generation, leading to low generalization ability. To address these problems,
we propose a more general automated method for building powerful interactions
named AutoPI. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: AutoPI
adopts a more general search space in which the computational graph is
generalized from existing network connections, and the interactive operators in
the edges of the graph are extracted from representative hand-crafted works. It
allows searching for various powerful feature interactions to produce higher
AUC and lower Logloss in a wide variety of applications. Besides, AutoPI
utilizes a gradient-based search strategy for exploration with a significantly
low computational cost. Experimentally, we evaluate AutoPI on a diverse suite
of benchmark datasets, demonstrating the generalizability and efficiency of
AutoPI over hand-crafted architectures and state-of-the-art NAS algorithms.</span>

often optimized based on several different parameters -- relevance to the
original query, diversity, click probability etc. One or many rankers may be
trained to score each suggestion from a candidate pool based on these factors.
These scorers are usually pairwise classification tasks where each training
example consists of a user query and a single suggestion from the list of
candidates. We propose an architecture that takes all candidate suggestions
associated with a given query and outputs a suggestion block. We discuss the
benefits of such an architecture over traditional approaches and experiment

                    <span>Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction plays an important role in many
industrial applications, and recently a lot of attention is paid to the deep
interest models which use attention mechanism to capture user interests from
historical behaviors. However, most current models are based on sequential
models which truncate the behavior sequences by a fixed length, thus have
difficulties in handling very long behavior sequences. Another big problem is
that sequences with the same length can be quite different in terms of time,
carrying completely different meanings. In this paper, we propose a
non-sequential approach to tackle the above problems. Specifically, we first
represent the behavior data in a sparse key-vector format, where the vector
contains rich behavior info such as time, count and category. Next, we enhance
the Deep Interest Network to take such rich information into account by a novel
attention network. The sparse representation makes it practical to handle large
scale long behavior sequences. Finally, we introduce a multidimensional
partition framework to mine behavior interactions. The framework can partition
data into custom designed time buckets to capture the interactions among
information aggregated in different time buckets. Similarly, it can also
partition the data into different categories and capture the interactions among
them. Experiments are conducted on two public datasets: one is an advertising
dataset and the other is a production recommender dataset. Our models
outperform other state-of-the-art models on both datasets.</span>

                    <span>Users&#x27; clicks on Web search results are one of the key signals for evaluating
and improving web search quality and have been widely used as part of current
state-of-the-art Learning-To-Rank(LTR) models. With a large volume of search
logs available for major search engines, effective models of searcher click
behavior have emerged to evaluate and train LTR models. However, when modeling
the users&#x27; click behavior, considering the bias of the behavior is imperative.
In particular, when a search result is not clicked, it is not necessarily
chosen as not relevant by the user, but instead could have been simply missed,
especially for lower-ranked results. These kinds of biases in the click log
data can be incorporated into the click models, propagating the errors to the
resulting LTR ranking models or evaluation metrics. In this paper, we propose
the De-biased Reinforcement Learning Click model (DRLC). The DRLC model relaxes
previously made assumptions about the users&#x27; examination behavior and resulting
latent states. To implement the DRLC model, convolutional neural networks are
used as the value networks for reinforcement learning, trained to learn a
policy to reduce bias in the click logs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
the DRLC model, we first compare performance with the previous state-of-art
approaches using established click prediction metrics, including log-likelihood
and perplexity. We further show that DRLC also leads to improvements in ranking
performance. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRLC model in
learning to reduce bias in click logs, leading to improved modeling performance
and showing the potential for using DRLC for improving Web search quality.</span>

                    <span>The performance of a cross-sectional currency strategy depends crucially on
accurately ranking instruments prior to portfolio construction. While this
ranking step is traditionally performed using heuristics, or by sorting outputs
produced by pointwise regression or classification models, Learning to Rank
algorithms have recently presented themselves as competitive and viable
alternatives. Despite improving ranking accuracy on average however, these
techniques do not account for the possibility that assets positioned at the
extreme ends of the ranked list -- which are ultimately used to construct the
long/short portfolios -- can assume different distributions in the input space,
and thus lead to sub-optimal strategy performance. Drawing from research in
Information Retrieval that demonstrates the utility of contextual information
embedded within top-ranked documents to learn the query&#x27;s characteristics to
improve ranking, we propose an analogous approach: exploiting the features of
both out- and under-performing instruments to learn a model for refining the
original ranked list. Under a re-ranking framework, we adapt the Transformer
architecture to encode the features of extreme assets for refining our
selection of long/short instruments obtained with an initial retrieval.
Backtesting on a set of 31 currencies, our proposed methodology significantly
boosts Sharpe ratios -- by approximately 20% over the original LTR algorithms
and double that of traditional baselines.</span>

                    <span>To support complex search tasks, where the initial information requirements
are complex or may change during the search, a search engine must adapt the
information delivery as the user&#x27;s information requirements evolve. To support
this dynamic ranking paradigm effectively, search result ranking must
incorporate both the user feedback received, and the information displayed so
far. To address this problem, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning-based
approach, RLIrank. We first build an adapted reinforcement learning framework
to integrate the key components of the dynamic search. Then, we implement a new
Learning to Rank (LTR) model for each iteration of the dynamic search, using a
recurrent Long Short Term Memory neural network (LSTM), which estimates the
gain for each next result, learning from each previously ranked document. To
incorporate the user&#x27;s feedback, we develop a word-embedding variation of the
classic Rocchio Algorithm, to help guide the ranking towards the high-value
documents. Those innovations enable RLIrank to outperform the previously
reported methods from the TREC Dynamic Domain Tracks 2017 and exceed all the
methods in 2016 TREC Dynamic Domain after multiple search iterations, advancing
the state of the art for dynamic search.</span>

                    <span>In recent years, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has been
applied to improve numerous processes, such as inventory management in retail
stores. However, automatic localization of RFID-tagged goods in stores is still
a challenging problem. To address this issue, we equip fixtures (e.g., shelves)
with reference tags and use data we collect during RFID-based stocktakes to map
articles to fixtures. Knowing the location of goods enables the implementation
of several practical applications, such as automated Money Mapping (i.e., a
heat map of sales across fixtures). Specifically, we conduct controlled lab
experiments and a case-study in two fashion retail stores to evaluate our
article-to-fixture prediction approaches. The approaches are based on
calculating distances between read event time series using DTW, and clustering
of read events using DBSCAN. We find that, read events collected during
RFID-based stocktakes can be used to assign articles to fixtures with an
accuracy of more than 90%. Additionally, we conduct a pilot to investigate the
challenges related to the integration of such a localization system in the
day-to-day business of retail stores. Hence, in this paper we present an
exploratory venture into novel and practical RFID-based applications in fashion
retails stores, beyond the scope of stock management.</span>

                    <span>This paper investigates the research question if senders of large amounts of
irrelevant or unsolicited information - commonly called &quot;spammers&quot; - distort
the network structure of social networks. Two large social networks are
analyzed, the first extracted from the Twitter discourse about a big
telecommunication company, and the second obtained from three years of email
communication of 200 managers working for a large multinational company. This
work compares network robustness and the stability of centrality and
interaction metrics, as well as the use of language, after removing spammers
and the most and least connected nodes. The results show that spammers do not
significantly alter the structure of the information-carrying network, for most
of the social indicators. The authors additionally investigate the correlation
between e-mail subject line and content by tracking language sentiment,
emotionality, and complexity, addressing the cases where collecting email
bodies is not permitted for privacy reasons. The findings extend the research
about robustness and stability of social networks metrics, after the
application of graph simplification strategies. The results have practical
implication for network analysts and for those company managers who rely on
network analytics (applied to company emails and social media data) to support
their decision-making processes.</span>

                    <span>Recommender systems (RSs) are software tools and algorithms developed to
alleviate the problem of information overload, which makes it difficult for a
user to make right decisions. Two main paradigms toward the recommendation
problem are collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, which try to
recommend the best items using ratings and content available. These methods
typically face infamous problems including cold-start, diversity, scalability,
and great computational expense. We argue that the uptake of deep learning and
reinforcement learning methods is also questionable due to their computational
complexities and uninterpretability. In this paper, we approach the
recommendation problem from a new prospective. We borrow ideas from cluster
head selection algorithms in wireless sensor networks and adapt them to the
recommendation problem. In particular, we propose Load Balanced Recommender
System (LBRS), which uses a probabilistic scheme for item recommendation.
Furthermore, we factor in the importance of items in the recommendation
process, which significantly improves the recommendation accuracy. We also
introduce a method that considers a heterogeneity among items, in order to
balance the similarity and diversity trade-off. Finally, we propose a new
metric for diversity, which emphasizes the importance of diversity not only
from an intra-list perspective, but also from a between-list point of view.
With experiments in a simulation study performed on RecSim, we show that LBRS
is effective and can outperform baseline methods.</span>

                    <span>In search and recommendation, diversifying the multi-aspect search results
could help with reducing redundancy, and promoting results that might not be
shown otherwise. Many previous methods have been proposed for this task.
However, previous methods do not explicitly consider the uniformity of the
number of the items&#x27; classes, or evenness, which could degrade the search and
recommendation quality. To address this problem, we introduce a novel method by
adapting the Simpson&#x27;s Diversity Index from biology, which enables a more
effective and efficient quadratic search result diversification algorithm. We
also extend the method to balance the diversity between multiple aspects
through weighted factors and further improve computational complexity by
developing a fast approximation algorithm. We demonstrate the feasibility of
the proposed method using the openly available Kaggle shoes competition
dataset. Our experimental results show that our approach outperforms previous
state of the art diversification methods, while reducing computational
complexity.</span>

protection in many countries. Currently, twelve countries adopt the regulation
and establish their GDPR-like regulation. However, to evaluate the differences
and similarities of these GDPR-like regulations is time-consuming and needs a
lot of manual effort from legal experts. Moreover, GDPR-like regulations from
different countries are written in their languages leading to a more difficult
task since legal experts who know both languages are essential. In this paper,
we investigate a simple natural language processing (NLP) approach to tackle
the problem. We first extract chunks of information from GDPR-like documents

                    <span>This is a short note on the performance of the ALI-G algorithm (Berrada et
al., 2020) as reported in (Loizou et al., 2021). ALI-G (Berrada et al., 2020)
and SPS (Loizou et al., 2021) are both adaptations of the Polyak step-size to
optimize machine learning models that can interpolate the training data. The
main algorithmic differences are that (1) SPS employs a multiplicative constant
in the denominator of the learning-rate while ALI-G uses an additive constant,
and (2) SPS uses an iteration-dependent maximal learning-rate while ALI-G uses
a constant one. There are also differences in the analysis provided by the two
works, with less restrictive assumptions proposed in (Loizou et al., 2021). In
their experiments, (Loizou et al., 2021) did not use momentum for ALI-G (which
is a standard part of the algorithm) or standard hyper-parameter tuning (for
e.g. learning-rate and regularization). Hence this note as a reference for the
improved performance that ALI-G can obtain with well-chosen hyper-parameters.
In particular, we show that when training a ResNet-34 on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100, the performance of ALI-G can reach respectively 93.5% (+6%) and 76%
(+8%) with a very small amount of tuning. Thus ALI-G remains a very competitive
method for training interpolating neural networks.</span>

                    <span>Recently regular decision processes have been proposed as a well-behaved form
of non-Markov decision process. Regular decision processes are characterised by
a transition function and a reward function that depend on the whole history,
though regularly (as in regular languages). In practice both the transition and
the reward functions can be seen as finite transducers. We study reinforcement
learning in regular decision processes. Our main contribution is to show that a
near-optimal policy can be PAC-learned in polynomial time in a set of
parameters that describe the underlying decision process. We argue that the
identified set of parameters is minimal and it reasonably captures the
difficulty of a regular decision process.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning applications have become ubiquitous. Their applications from
machine embedded control in production over process optimization in diverse
areas (e.g., traffic, finance, sciences) to direct user interactions like
advertising and recommendations. This has led to an increased effort of making
machine learning trustworthy. Explainable and fair AI have already matured.
They address knowledgeable users and application engineers. However, there are
users that want to deploy a learned model in a similar way as their washing
machine. These stakeholders do not want to spend time understanding the model.
Instead, they want to rely on guaranteed properties. What are the relevant
properties? How can they be expressed to stakeholders without presupposing
machine learning knowledge? How can they be guaranteed for a certain
implementation of a model? These questions move far beyond the current
state-of-the-art and we want to address them here. We propose a unified
framework that certifies learning methods via care labels. They are easy to
understand and draw inspiration from well-known certificates like textile
labels or property cards of electronic devices. Our framework considers both,
the machine learning theory and a given implementation. We test the
implementation&#x27;s compliance with theoretical properties and bounds. In this
paper, we illustrate care labels by a prototype implementation of a
certification suite for a selection of probabilistic graphical models.</span>

                    <span>The increasing complexity of algorithms for analyzing medical data, including
de-identification tasks, raises the possibility that complex algorithms are
learning not just the general representation of the problem, but specifics of
given individuals within the data. Modern legal frameworks specifically
prohibit the intentional or accidental distribution of patient data, but have
not addressed this potential avenue for leakage of such protected health
information. Modern deep learning algorithms have the highest potential of such
leakage due to complexity of the models. Recent research in the field has
highlighted such issues in non-medical data, but all analysis is likely to be
data and algorithm specific. We, therefore, chose to analyze a state-of-the-art
free-text de-identification algorithm based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
and its potential in encoding any individual in the training set. Using the
i2b2 Challenge Data, we trained, then analyzed the model to assess whether the
output of the LSTM, before the compression layer of the classifier, could be
used to estimate the membership of the training data. Furthermore, we used
different attacks including membership inference attack method to attack the
model. Results indicate that the attacks could not identify whether members of
the training data were distinguishable from non-members based on the model
output. This indicates that the model does not provide any strong evidence into
the identification of the individuals in the training data set and there is not
yet empirical evidence it is unsafe to distribute the model for general use.</span>

                    <span>The evolution of electronic media is a mixed blessing. Due to the easy
access, low cost, and faster reach of the information, people search out and
devour news from online social networks. In contrast, the increasing acceptance
of social media reporting leads to the spread of fake news. This is a minacious
problem that causes disputes and endangers societal stability and harmony. Fake
news spread has gained attention from researchers due to its vicious nature.
proliferation of misinformation in all media, from the internet to cable news,
paid advertising and local news outlets, has made it essential for people to
identify the misinformation and sort through the facts. Researchers are trying
to analyze the credibility of information and curtail false information on such
platforms. Credibility is the believability of the piece of information at
hand. Analyzing the credibility of fake news is challenging due to the intent
of its creation and the polychromatic nature of the news. In this work, we
propose a model for detecting fake news. Our method investigates the content of
the news at the early stage i.e. when the news is published but is yet to be
disseminated through social media. Our work interprets the content with
automatic feature extraction and the relevance of the text pieces. In summary,
we introduce stance as one of the features along with the content of the
article and employ the pre-trained contextualized word embeddings BERT to
obtain the state-of-art results for fake news detection. The experiment
conducted on the real-world dataset indicates that our model outperforms the
previous work and enables fake news detection with an accuracy of 95.32%.</span>

                    <span>This paper studies the theoretical underpinnings of machine learning of
ergodic It\^o diffusions. The objective is to understand the convergence
properties of the invariant statistics when the underlying system of stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) is empirically estimated with a supervised
regression framework. Using the perturbation theory of ergodic Markov chains
and the linear response theory, we deduce a linear dependence of the errors of
one-point and two-point invariant statistics on the error in the learning of
the drift and diffusion coefficients. More importantly, our study shows that
the usual $L^2$-norm characterization of the learning generalization error is
insufficient for achieving this linear dependence result. We find that
sufficient conditions for such a linear dependence result are through learning
algorithms that produce a uniformly Lipschitz and consistent estimator in the
hypothesis space that retains certain characteristics of the drift
coefficients, such as the usual linear growth condition that guarantees the
existence of solutions of the underlying SDEs. We examine these conditions on
two well-understood learning algorithms: the kernel-based spectral regression
method and the shallow random neural networks with the ReLU activation
function.</span>

induce noise into video feeds. We observe that popular unsupervised MOT methods
are dependent on noise-free conditions. We show that the addition of a small
amount of artificial random noise causes a sharp degradation in model
performance on benchmark metrics. We resolve this problem by introducing a
robust unsupervised multi-object tracking (MOT) model: AttU-Net. The proposed
single-head attention model helps limit the negative impact of noise by
learning visual representations at different segment scales. AttU-Net shows
better unsupervised MOT tracking performance over variational inference-based
state-of-the-art baselines. We evaluate our method in the MNIST and the Atari
game video benchmark. We also provide two extended video datasets consisting of
complex visual patterns that include Kuzushiji characters and fashion images to
validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</span>

$\boldsymbol{\beta}_\star$ is an unknown vector, $\left\{{\bf

$\left\{{n}_i\right\}_{i&#x3D;1}^n$ model the noise. Particularly, under some
plausible assumptions on the statistical distribution of the data, we
characterize the feasibility condition for the hard support vector regression
in the regime of high dimensions and, when feasible, derive an asymptotic
approximation for its risk. Similarly, we study the test risk for the soft
support vector regression as a function of its parameters. Our results are then
used to optimally tune the parameters intervening in the design of hard and
soft support vector regression algorithms. Based on our analysis, we illustrate
that adding more samples may be harmful to the test performance of support
vector regression, while it is always beneficial when the parameters are
optimally selected. Such a result reminds a similar phenomenon observed in
modern learning architectures according to which optimally tuned architectures
present a decreasing test performance curve with respect to the number of

                    <span>Supervised deep learning has swiftly become a workhorse for accelerated MRI
in recent years, offering state-of-the-art performance in image reconstruction
from undersampled acquisitions. Training deep supervised models requires large
datasets of undersampled and fully-sampled acquisitions typically from a
matching set of subjects. Given scarce access to large medical datasets, this
limitation has sparked interest in unsupervised methods that reduce reliance on
fully-sampled ground-truth data. A common framework is based on the deep image
prior, where network-driven regularization is enforced directly during
inference on undersampled acquisitions. Yet, canonical convolutional
architectures are suboptimal in capturing long-range relationships, and
randomly initialized networks may hamper convergence. To address these
limitations, here we introduce a novel unsupervised MRI reconstruction method
based on zero-Shot Learned Adversarial TransformERs (SLATER). SLATER embodies a
deep adversarial network with cross-attention transformer blocks to map noise
and latent variables onto MR images. This unconditional network learns a
high-quality MRI prior in a self-supervised encoding task. A zero-shot
reconstruction is performed on undersampled test data, where inference is
performed by optimizing network parameters, latent and noise variables to
ensure maximal consistency to multi-coil MRI data. Comprehensive experiments on
brain MRI datasets clearly demonstrate the superior performance of SLATER
against several state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.</span>

                    <span>The medical domain is often subject to information overload. The digitization
of healthcare, constant updates to online medical repositories, and increasing
availability of biomedical datasets make it challenging to effectively analyze
the data. This creates additional work for medical professionals who are
heavily dependent on medical data to complete their research and consult their
patients. This paper aims to show how different text highlighting techniques
can capture relevant medical context. This would reduce the doctors&#x27; cognitive
load and response time to patients by facilitating them in making faster
decisions, thus improving the overall quality of online medical services. Three
different word-level text highlighting methodologies are implemented and
evaluated. The first method uses TF-IDF scores directly to highlight important
parts of the text. The second method is a combination of TF-IDF scores and the
application of Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations to
classification models. The third method uses neural networks directly to make
predictions on whether or not a word should be highlighted. The results of our
experiments show that the neural network approach is successful in highlighting
medically-relevant terms and its performance is improved as the size of the
input segment increases.</span>

                    <span>Sparse rewards are double-edged training signals in reinforcement learning:
easy to design but hard to optimize. Intrinsic motivation guidances have thus
been developed toward alleviating the resulting exploration problem. They
usually incentivize agents to look for new states through novelty signals. Yet,
such methods encourage exhaustive exploration of the state space rather than
focusing on the environment&#x27;s salient interaction opportunities. We propose a
new exploration method, called Don&#x27;t Do What Doesn&#x27;t Matter (DoWhaM), shifting
the emphasis from state novelty to state with relevant actions. While most
actions consistently change the state when used, \textit{e.g.} moving the
agent, some actions are only effective in specific states, \textit{e.g.},
\emph{opening} a door, \emph{grabbing} an object. DoWhaM detects and rewards
actions that seldom affect the environment. We evaluate DoWhaM on the
procedurally-generated environment MiniGrid, against state-of-the-art methods

retrieval, i.e., retrieving relevant images from a large and unlabelled dataset
given textual queries. In this paper, we propose VisualSparta, a novel

improvement in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. VisualSparta is capable
of outperforming previous state-of-the-art scalable methods in MSCOCO and
Flickr30K. We also show that it achieves substantial retrieving speed
advantages, i.e., for a 1 million image index, VisualSparta using CPU gets
~391X speedup compared to CPU vector search and ~5.4X speedup compared to
vector search with GPU acceleration. Experiments show that this speed advantage
even gets bigger for larger datasets because VisualSparta can be efficiently
implemented as an inverted index. To the best of our knowledge, VisualSparta is
the first transformer-based text-to-image retrieval model that can achieve
real-time searching for large-scale datasets, with significant accuracy
improvement compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>The performance of a cross-sectional currency strategy depends crucially on
accurately ranking instruments prior to portfolio construction. While this
ranking step is traditionally performed using heuristics, or by sorting outputs
produced by pointwise regression or classification models, Learning to Rank
algorithms have recently presented themselves as competitive and viable
alternatives. Despite improving ranking accuracy on average however, these
techniques do not account for the possibility that assets positioned at the
extreme ends of the ranked list -- which are ultimately used to construct the
long/short portfolios -- can assume different distributions in the input space,
and thus lead to sub-optimal strategy performance. Drawing from research in
Information Retrieval that demonstrates the utility of contextual information
embedded within top-ranked documents to learn the query&#x27;s characteristics to
improve ranking, we propose an analogous approach: exploiting the features of
both out- and under-performing instruments to learn a model for refining the
original ranked list. Under a re-ranking framework, we adapt the Transformer
architecture to encode the features of extreme assets for refining our
selection of long/short instruments obtained with an initial retrieval.
Backtesting on a set of 31 currencies, our proposed methodology significantly
boosts Sharpe ratios -- by approximately 20% over the original LTR algorithms
and double that of traditional baselines.</span>

the leading causes of death among men, with almost 1.41 million new cases and
around 375,000 deaths in 2020. Artificial Intelligence algorithms have had a
huge impact in medical image analysis, including digital histopathology, where
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to provide a fast and accurate
diagnosis, supporting experts in this task. To perform an automatic diagnosis,
prostate tissue samples are first digitized into gigapixel-resolution
whole-slide images. Due to the size of these images, neural networks cannot use
them as input and, therefore, small subimages called patches are extracted and
predicted, obtaining a patch-level classification. In this work, a novel patch
aggregation method based on a custom Wide &amp; Deep neural network model is
presented, which performs a slide-level classification using the patch-level
classes obtained from a CNN. The malignant tissue ratio, a 10-bin malignant
probability histogram, the least squares regression line of the histogram, and
the number of malignant connected components are used by the proposed model to
perform the classification. An accuracy of 94.24% and a sensitivity of 98.87%
were achieved, proving that the proposed system could aid pathologists by
speeding up the screening process and, thus, contribute to the fight against
PCa.</span>

                    <span>In this draft paper, we introduce a novel architecture for graph networks
which is equivariant to the Euclidean group in $n$-dimensions. The model is
designed to work with graph networks in their general form and can be shown to
include particular variants as special cases. Thanks to its equivariance
properties, we expect the proposed model to be more data efficient with respect
to classical graph architectures and also intrinsically equipped with a better
inductive bias. We defer investigating this matter to future work.</span>

                    <span>Among dissimilarities between probability distributions, the Kernel Stein
Discrepancy (KSD) has received much interest recently. We investigate the
properties of its Wasserstein gradient flow to approximate a target probability
distribution $\pi$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$, known up to a normalization constant.
This leads to a straightforwardly implementable, deterministic score-based
method to sample from $\pi$, named KSD Descent, which uses a set of particles
to approximate $\pi$. Remarkably, owing to a tractable loss function, KSD
Descent can leverage robust parameter-free optimization schemes such as L-BFGS;
this contrasts with other popular particle-based schemes such as the Stein
Variational Gradient Descent algorithm. We study the convergence properties of
KSD Descent and demonstrate its practical relevance. However, we also highlight
failure cases by showing that the algorithm can get stuck in spurious local
minima.</span>

                    <span>Massive multiple-input multiple-output can obtain more performance gain by
exploiting the downlink channel state information (CSI) at the base station
(BS). Therefore, studying CSI feedback with limited communication resources in
frequency-division duplexing systems is of great importance. Recently, deep
learning (DL)-based CSI feedback has shown considerable potential. However, the
existing DL-based explicit feedback schemes are difficult to deploy because
current fifth-generation mobile communication protocols and systems are
designed based on an implicit feedback mechanism. In this paper, we propose a
DL-based implicit feedback architecture to inherit the low-overhead
characteristic, which uses neural networks (NNs) to replace the precoding
matrix indicator (PMI) encoding and decoding modules. By using environment
information, the NNs can achieve a more refined mapping between the precoding
matrix and the PMI compared with codebooks. The correlation between subbands is
also used to further improve the feedback performance. Simulation results show
that, for a single resource block (RB), the proposed architecture can save
25.0% and 40.0% of overhead compared with Type I codebook under two antenna
configurations, respectively. For a wideband system with 52 RBs, overhead can
be saved by 30.7% and 48.0% compared with Type II codebook when ignoring and
considering extracting subband correlation, respectively.</span>

                    <span>The need for accurate yield estimates for viticulture is becoming more
important due to increasing competition in the wine market worldwide. One of
the most promising methods to estimate the harvest is berry counting, as it can
be approached non-destructively, and its process can be automated. In this
article, we present a method that addresses the challenge of occluded berries
with leaves to obtain a more accurate estimate of the number of berries that
will enable a better estimate of the harvest. We use generative adversarial
networks, a deep learning-based approach that generates a likely scenario
behind the leaves exploiting learned patterns from images with non-occluded
berries. Our experiments show that the estimate of the number of berries after
applying our method is closer to the manually counted reference. In contrast to
applying a factor to the berry count, our approach better adapts to local
conditions by directly involving the appearance of the visible berries.
Furthermore, we show that our approach can identify which areas in the image
should be changed by adding new berries without explicitly requiring
information about hidden areas.</span>

                    <span>Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine-learning paradigm, in
which a global server iteratively averages the model parameters of local users
without accessing their data. User heterogeneity has imposed significant
challenges to FL, which can incur drifted global models that are slow to
converge. Knowledge Distillation has recently emerged to tackle this issue, by
refining the server model using aggregated knowledge from heterogeneous users,
other than directly averaging their model parameters. This approach, however,
depends on a proxy dataset, making it impractical unless such a prerequisite is
satisfied. Moreover, the ensemble knowledge is not fully utilized to guide
local model learning, which may in turn affect the quality of the aggregated
model. Inspired by the prior art, we propose a data-free knowledge
distillation} approach to address heterogeneous FL, where the server learns a
lightweight generator to ensemble user information in a data-free manner, which
is then broadcasted to users, regulating local training using the learned
knowledge as an inductive bias. Empirical studies powered by theoretical
implications show that, our approach facilitates FL with better generalization
performance using fewer communication rounds, compared with the
state-of-the-art.</span>

                    <span>Sentence embeddings are an important component of many natural language
processing (NLP) systems. Like word embeddings, sentence embeddings are
typically learned on large text corpora and then transferred to various
downstream tasks, such as clustering and retrieval. Unlike word embeddings, the
highest performing solutions for learning sentence embeddings require labelled
data, limiting their usefulness to languages and domains where labelled data is
abundant. In this paper, we present DeCLUTR: Deep Contrastive Learning for
Unsupervised Textual Representations. Inspired by recent advances in deep
metric learning (DML), we carefully design a self-supervised objective for
learning universal sentence embeddings that does not require labelled training
data. When used to extend the pretraining of transformer-based language models,
our approach closes the performance gap between unsupervised and supervised
pretraining for universal sentence encoders. Importantly, our experiments
suggest that the quality of the learned embeddings scale with both the number
of trainable parameters and the amount of unlabelled training data, making
further improvements straightforward. Our code and pretrained models are
publicly available and can be easily adapted to new domains or used to embed
unseen text.</span>

                    <span>Context-aware machine translation models are designed to leverage contextual
information, but often fail to do so. As a result, they inaccurately
disambiguate pronouns and polysemous words that require context for resolution.
In this paper, we ask several questions: What contexts do human translators use
to resolve ambiguous words? Are models paying large amounts of attention to the
same context? What if we explicitly train them to do so? To answer these
questions, we introduce SCAT (Supporting Context for Ambiguous Translations), a
new English-French dataset comprising supporting context words for 14K
translations that professional translators found useful for pronoun
disambiguation. Using SCAT, we perform an in-depth analysis of the context used
to disambiguate, examining positional and lexical characteristics of the
supporting words. Furthermore, we measure the degree of alignment between the
model&#x27;s attention scores and the supporting context from SCAT, and apply a
guided attention strategy to encourage agreement between the two.</span>

                    <span>Latent Gaussian models and boosting are widely used techniques in statistics
and machine learning. Tree-boosting shows excellent predictive accuracy on many
data sets, but potential drawbacks are that it assumes conditional independence
of samples, produces discontinuous predictions for, e.g., spatial data, and it
can have difficulty with high-cardinality categorical variables. Latent
Gaussian models, such as Gaussian process and grouped random effects models,
are flexible prior models that allow for making probabilistic predictions.
However, existing latent Gaussian models usually assume either a zero or a
linear prior mean function which can be an unrealistic assumption. This article
introduces a novel approach that combines boosting and latent Gaussian models
in order to remedy the above-mentioned drawbacks and to leverage the advantages
of both techniques. We obtain increased predictive accuracy compared to
existing approaches in both simulated and real-world data experiments.</span>

                    <span>An agnostic PAC learning algorithm finds a predictor that is competitive with
the best predictor in a benchmark hypothesis class, where competitiveness is
measured with respect to a given loss function. However, its predictions might
be quite sub-optimal for structured subgroups of individuals, such as protected
demographic groups. Motivated by such fairness concerns, we study &quot;multi-group
agnostic PAC learnability&quot;: fixing a measure of loss, a benchmark class $\H$
and a (potentially) rich collection of subgroups $\G$, the objective is to
learn a single predictor such that the loss experienced by every group $g \in
\G$ is not much larger than the best possible loss for this group within $\H$.
Under natural conditions, we provide a characterization of the loss functions
for which such a predictor is guaranteed to exist. For any such loss function
we construct a learning algorithm whose sample complexity is logarithmic in the
size of the collection $\G$. Our results unify and extend previous positive and
negative results from the multi-group fairness literature, which applied for
specific loss functions.</span>

                    <span>The computational cost of usual Monte Carlo methods for sampling a posteriori
laws in Bayesian inference scales linearly with the number of data points. One
option to reduce it to a fraction of this cost is to resort to mini-batching in
conjunction with unadjusted discretizations of Langevin dynamics, in which case
only a random fraction of the data is used to estimate the gradient. However,
this leads to an additional noise in the dynamics and hence a bias on the
invariant measure which is sampled by the Markov chain. We advocate using the
so-called Adaptive Langevin dynamics, which is a modification of standard
inertial Langevin dynamics with a dynamical friction which automatically
corrects for the increased noise arising from mini-batching. We investigate the
practical relevance of the assumptions underpinning Adaptive Langevin (constant
covariance for the estimation of the gradient), which are not satisfied in
typical models of Bayesian inference; and show how to extend the approach to
more general situations.</span>

multi-manifold Representation Learning (DCRL) that preserves the geometric
structure of data. In the proposed framework, manifold clustering is done in
the latent space guided by a clustering loss. To overcome the problem that
clustering-oriented losses may deteriorate the geometric structure of
embeddings in the latent space, an isometric loss is proposed for preserving
intra-manifold structure locally and a ranking loss for inter-manifold
structure globally. Experimental results on various datasets show that DCRL
leads to performances comparable to current state-of-the-art deep clustering
algorithms, yet exhibits superior performance for manifold representation. Our
results also demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of the proposed
losses in preserving geometric structure in terms of visualization and
performance metrics.</span>

interpretation and analysis has become critical. This is particularly true when
data comes from complex systems where extensive structure is available, but
must be drawn from peripheral sources. In this paper we argue that in such
situations, sheaves can provide a natural framework to analyze how well a
statistical model fits at the local level (that is, on subsets of related
datapoints) vs the global level (on all the data). The sheaf-based approach
that we propose is suitably general enough to be useful in a range of

                    <span>Time-series representation learning is a fundamental task for time-series
analysis. While significant progress has been made to achieve accurate
representations for downstream applications, the learned representations often
lack interpretability and do not expose semantic meanings. Different from
previous efforts on the entangled feature space, we aim to extract the
semantic-rich temporal correlations in the latent interpretable factorized
representation of the data. Motivated by the success of disentangled
representation learning in computer vision, we study the possibility of
learning semantic-rich time-series representations, which remains unexplored
due to three main challenges: 1) sequential data structure introduces complex
temporal correlations and makes the latent representations hard to interpret,
2) sequential models suffer from KL vanishing problem, and 3) interpretable
semantic concepts for time-series often rely on multiple factors instead of
individuals. To bridge the gap, we propose Disentangle Time Series (DTS), a
novel disentanglement enhancement framework for sequential data. Specifically,
to generate hierarchical semantic concepts as the interpretable and
disentangled representation of time-series, DTS introduces multi-level
disentanglement strategies by covering both individual latent factors and group
semantic segments. We further theoretically show how to alleviate the KL
vanishing problem: DTS introduces a mutual information maximization term, while
preserving a heavier penalty on the total correlation and the dimension-wise KL
to keep the disentanglement property. Experimental results on various
real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the representations learned by
DTS achieve superior performance in downstream applications, with high
interpretability of semantic concepts.</span>

                    <span>Detailed parcel-level crop type mapping for the whole European Union (EU) is
necessary for the evaluation of agricultural policies. The Copernicus program,
and Sentinel-1 (S1) in particular, offers the opportunity to monitor
agricultural land at a continental scale and in a timely manner. However, so
far the potential of S1 has not been explored at such a scale. Capitalizing on
the unique LUCAS 2018 Copernicus in-situ survey, we present the first
continental crop type map at 10-m spatial resolution for the EU based on S1A
and S1B Synthetic Aperture Radar observations for the year 2018. Random forest
classification algorithms are tuned to detect 19 different crop types. We
assess the accuracy of this EU crop map with three approaches. First, the
accuracy is assessed with independent LUCAS core in-situ observations over the
continent. Second, an accuracy assessment is done specifically for main crop
types from farmers declarations from 6 EU member countries or regions totaling
&gt;3M parcels and 8.21 Mha. Finally, the crop areas derived by classification are
compared to the subnational (NUTS 2) area statistics reported by Eurostat. The
overall accuracy for the map is reported as 80.3% when grouping main crop
classes and 76% when considering all 19 crop type classes separately. Highest
accuracies are obtained for rape and turnip rape with user and produced
accuracies higher than 96%. The correlation between the remotely sensed
estimated and Eurostat reported crop area ranges from 0.93 (potatoes) to 0.99
(rape and turnip rape). Finally, we discuss how the framework presented here
can underpin the operational delivery of in-season high-resolution based crop
mapping.</span>

                    <span>It is a difficult task for both professional investors and individual traders
continuously making profit in stock market. With the development of computer
science and deep reinforcement learning, Buy\&amp;Hold (B\&amp;H) has been oversteped
by many artificial intelligence trading algorithms. However, the information
and process are not enough, which limit the performance of reinforcement
learning algorithms. Thus, we propose a parallel-network continuous
quantitative trading model with GARCH and PPO to enrich the basical deep
reinforcement learning model, where the deep learning parallel network layers
deal with 3 different frequencies data (including GARCH information) and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm interacts actions and rewards with
stock trading environment. Experiments in 5 stocks from Chinese stock market
show our method achieves more extra profit comparing with basical reinforcement
learning methods and bench models.</span>

                    <span>Ordinal embedding aims at finding a low dimensional representation of objects
from a set of constraints of the form &quot;item $j$ is closer to item $i$ than item
$k$&quot;. Typically, each object is mapped onto a point vector in a low dimensional
metric space. We argue that mapping to a density instead of a point vector
provides some interesting advantages, including an inherent reflection of the
uncertainty about the representation itself and its relative location in the
space. Indeed, in this paper, we propose to embed each object as a Gaussian
distribution. We investigate the ability of these embeddings to capture the
underlying structure of the data while satisfying the constraints, and explore
properties of the representation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets showcase the advantages of our approach. In addition, we illustrate
the merit of modelling uncertainty, which enriches the visual perception of the
mapped objects in the space.</span>

                    <span>In a dialogue system pipeline, a natural language generation (NLG) unit
converts the dialogue direction and content to a corresponding natural language
realization. A recent trend for dialogue systems is to first pre-train on large
datasets and then fine-tune in a supervised manner using datasets annotated
with application-specific features. Though novel behaviours can be learned from
custom annotation, the required effort severely bounds the quantity of the
training set, and the application-specific nature limits the reuse. In light of
the recent success of data-driven approaches, we propose the novel future
bridging NLG (FBNLG) concept for dialogue systems and simulators. The critical
step is for an FBNLG to accept a future user or system utterance to bridge the
present context towards. Future bridging enables self supervised training over
annotation-free datasets, decoupled the training of NLG from the rest of the
system. An FBNLG, pre-trained with massive datasets, is expected to apply in
classical or new dialogue scenarios with minimal adaptation effort. We evaluate
a prototype FBNLG to show that future bridging can be a viable approach to a
universal few-shot NLG for task-oriented and chit-chat dialogues.</span>

                    <span>A planetary system consists of a host star and one or more planets, arranged
into a particular configuration. Here, we consider what information belongs to
the configuration, or ordering, of 4286 Kepler planets in their 3277 planetary
systems. First, we train a neural network model to predict the radius and
period of a planet based on the properties of its host star and the radii and
period of its neighbors. The mean absolute error of the predictions of the
trained model is a factor of 2.1 better than the MAE of the predictions of a
naive model which draws randomly from dynamically allowable periods and radii.
Second, we adapt a model used for unsupervised part-of-speech tagging in
computational linguistics to investigate whether planets or planetary systems
fall into natural categories with physically interpretable &quot;grammatical rules.&quot;
The model identifies two robust groups of planetary systems: (1) compact
multi-planet systems and (2) systems around giant stars ($\log{g} \lesssim
4.0$), although the latter group is strongly sculpted by the selection bias of
the transit method. These results reinforce the idea that planetary systems are
not random sequences -- instead, as a population, they contain predictable
patterns that can provide insight into the formation and evolution of planetary
systems.</span>

(PSGD) are scalable algorithms to compute model parameters in unconstrained and
constrained optimization problems. In comparison with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD), PSGD forces its iterative values into the constrained parameter
space via projection. The convergence rate of PSGD-type estimates has been
exhaustedly studied, while statistical properties such as asymptotic
distribution remain less explored. From a purely statistical point of view,
this paper studies the limiting distribution of PSGD-based estimate when the

findings reveal the role of projection played in the uncertainty of the PSGD

test the linear-equality constraints. Simulation studies on synthetic data and

                    <span>We show that the popular reinforcement learning (RL) strategy of estimating
the state-action value (Q-function) by minimizing the mean squared Bellman
error leads to a regression problem with confounding, the inputs and output
noise being correlated. Hence, direct minimization of the Bellman error can
result in significantly biased Q-function estimates. We explain why fixing the
target Q-network in Deep Q-Networks and Fitted Q Evaluation provides a way of
overcoming this confounding, thus shedding new light on this popular but not
well understood trick in the deep RL literature. An alternative approach to
address confounding is to leverage techniques developed in the causality
literature, notably instrumental variables (IV). We bring together here the
literature on IV and RL by investigating whether IV approaches can lead to
improved Q-function estimates. This paper analyzes and compares a wide range of
recent IV methods in the context of offline policy evaluation (OPE), where the
goal is to estimate the value of a policy using logged data only. By applying
different IV techniques to OPE, we are not only able to recover previously
proposed OPE methods such as model-based techniques but also to obtain
competitive new techniques. We find empirically that state-of-the-art OPE
methods are closely matched in performance by some IV methods such as AGMM,
which were not developed for OPE. We open-source all our code and datasets at

                    <span>Reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to create a decision-making agent for
autonomous driving. However, previous approaches provide only black-box
solutions, which do not offer information on how confident the agent is about
its decisions. An estimate of both the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of
the agent&#x27;s decisions is fundamental for real-world applications of autonomous
driving. Therefore, this paper introduces the Ensemble Quantile Networks (EQN)
method, which combines distributional RL with an ensemble approach, to obtain a
complete uncertainty estimate. The distribution over returns is estimated by
learning its quantile function implicitly, which gives the aleatoric
uncertainty, whereas an ensemble of agents is trained on bootstrapped data to
provide a Bayesian estimation of the epistemic uncertainty. A criterion for
classifying which decisions that have an unacceptable uncertainty is also
introduced. The results show that the EQN method can balance risk and time
efficiency in different occluded intersection scenarios, by considering the
estimated aleatoric uncertainty. Furthermore, it is shown that the trained
agent can use the epistemic uncertainty information to identify situations that
the agent has not been trained for and thereby avoid making unfounded,
potentially dangerous, decisions outside of the training distribution.</span>

intelligence has emerged as a promising way to lighten the computation load on
edge devices that run applications based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).
Typically, a deep model is split at a certain layer into edge and cloud
sub-models. The deep feature tensor produced by the edge sub-model is
transmitted to the cloud, where the remaining computationally intensive
workload is performed by the cloud sub-model. The communication channel between
the edge and cloud is imperfect, which will result in missing data in the deep
feature tensor received at the cloud side. In this study, we examine the
effectiveness of four low-rank tensor completion methods in recovering missing
data in the deep feature tensor. We consider both sparse tensors, such as those
produced by the VGG16 model, as well as non-sparse tensors, such as those
produced by ResNet34 model. We study tensor completion effectiveness in both

of oxygen and nutrients to the surrounding cells. Various diseases have been
shown to alter the density of nutritive capillaries and the flow velocity of
erythrocytes. In previous studies, capillary density and flow velocity have
been assessed manually by trained specialists. Manual analysis of a 20-second
long microvascular video takes on average 20 minutes and requires extensive
training. Several studies have reported that manual analysis hinders the
application of microvascular microscopy in a clinical setting. In this paper,
we present a fully automated system, called CapillaryNet, that can automate
microvascular microscopy analysis so it can be used as a clinical application.
Moreover, CapillaryNet measures several microvascular parameters that

                    <span>First-person object-interaction tasks in high-fidelity, 3D, simulated
environments such as the AI2Thor virtual home-environment pose significant
sample-efficiency challenges for reinforcement learning (RL) agents learning
from sparse task rewards. To alleviate these challenges, prior work has
provided extensive supervision via a combination of reward-shaping,
ground-truth object-information, and expert demonstrations. In this work, we
show that one can learn object-interaction tasks from scratch without
supervision by learning an attentive object-model as an auxiliary task during
task learning with an object-centric relational RL agent. Our key insight is
that learning an object-model that incorporates object-attention into forward
prediction provides a dense learning signal for unsupervised representation
learning of both objects and their relationships. This, in turn, enables faster
policy learning for an object-centric relational RL agent. We demonstrate our
agent by introducing a set of challenging object-interaction tasks in the
AI2Thor environment where learning with our attentive object-model is key to
strong performance. Specifically, we compare our agent and relational RL agents
with alternative auxiliary tasks to a relational RL agent equipped with
ground-truth object-information, and show that learning with our object-model
best closes the performance gap in terms of both learning speed and maximum
success rate. Additionally, we find that incorporating object-attention into an
object-model&#x27;s forward predictions is key to learning representations which
capture object-category and object-state.</span>

                    <span>We present a simple and intuitive approach for interactive control of
physically simulated characters. Our work builds upon generative adversarial
networks (GAN) and reinforcement learning, and introduces an imitation learning
framework where an ensemble of classifiers and an imitation policy are trained
in tandem given pre-processed reference clips. The classifiers are trained to
discriminate the reference motion from the motion generated by the imitation
policy, while the policy is rewarded for fooling the discriminators. Using our
GAN-based approach, multiple motor control policies can be trained separately
to imitate different behaviors. In runtime, our system can respond to external
control signal provided by the user and interactively switch between different
policies. Compared to existing methods, our proposed approach has the following
attractive properties: 1) achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance
without manually designing and fine tuning a reward function; 2) directly
controls the character without having to track any target reference pose
explicitly or implicitly through a phase state; and 3) supports interactive
policy switching without requiring any motion generation or motion matching
mechanism. We highlight the applicability of our approach in a range of
imitation and interactive control tasks, while also demonstrating its ability
to withstand external perturbations as well as to recover balance. Overall, our
approach generates high-fidelity motion, has low runtime cost, and can be
easily integrated into interactive applications and games.</span>

                    <span>Data augmentation has recently seen increased interest in NLP due to more
work in low-resource domains, new tasks, and the popularity of large-scale
neural networks that require large amounts of training data. Despite this
recent upsurge, this area is still relatively underexplored, perhaps due to the
challenges posed by the discrete nature of language data. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive and unifying survey of data augmentation for NLP by
summarizing the literature in a structured manner. We first introduce and
motivate data augmentation for NLP, and then discuss major methodologically
representative approaches. Next, we highlight techniques that are used for
popular NLP applications and tasks. We conclude by outlining current challenges
and directions for future research. Overall, our paper aims to clarify the
landscape of existing literature in data augmentation for NLP and motivate
additional work in this area. We also present a GitHub repository with a paper

                    <span>Pelvic ring disruptions result from blunt injury mechanisms and are often
found in patients with multi-system trauma. To grade pelvic fracture severity
in trauma victims based on whole-body CT, the Tile AO/OTA classification is
frequently used. Due to the high volume of whole-body trauma CTs generated in
busy trauma centers, an automated approach to Tile classification would provide
substantial value, e.,g., to prioritize the reading queue of the attending
trauma radiologist. In such scenario, an automated method should perform
grading based on a transparent process and based on interpretable features to
enable interaction with human readers and lower their workload by offering
insights from a first automated read of the scan. This paper introduces an
automated yet interpretable pelvic trauma decision support system to assist
radiologists in fracture detection and Tile grade classification. The method
operates similarly to human interpretation of CT scans and first detects
distinct pelvic fractures on CT with high specificity using a Faster-RCNN model
that are then interpreted using a structural causal model based on clinical
best practices to infer an initial Tile grade. The Bayesian causal model and
finally, the object detector are then queried for likely co-occurring fractures
that may have been rejected initially due to the highly specific operating
point of the detector, resulting in an updated list of detected fractures and
corresponding final Tile grade. Our method is transparent in that it provides
finding location and type using the object detector, as well as information on
important counterfactuals that would invalidate the system&#x27;s recommendation and
achieves an AUC of 83.3%/85.1% for translational/rotational instability.
Despite being designed for human-machine teaming, our approach does not
compromise on performance compared to previous black-box approaches.</span>

                    <span>The choice of optimal event variables is crucial for achieving the maximal
sensitivity of experimental analyses. Over time, physicists have derived
suitable kinematic variables for many typical event topologies in collider
physics. Here we introduce a deep learning technique to design good event
variables, which are sensitive over a wide range of values for the unknown
model parameters. We demonstrate that the neural networks trained with our
technique on some simple event topologies are able to reproduce standard event
variables like invariant mass, transverse mass, and stransverse mass. The
method is automatable, completely general, and can be used to derive sensitive,
previously unknown, event variables for other, more complex event topologies.</span>

                    <span>Federated Learning (FL) has shown great potential as a privacy-preserving
solution to learning from decentralized data which are only accessible locally
on end devices (i.e., clients). In many scenarios, however, a large proportion
of the clients are probably in possession of low-quality data that are biased,
noisy or even irrelevant. As a result, they could significantly slow down the
convergence of the global model we aim to build and also compromise its
quality. In light of this, we propose FedProf, a novel protocol for optimizing
FL under such circumstances without breaching data privacy. The key of our
approach is using the global model to dynamically profile the latent
representations of data (termed representation footprints) on the clients. By
matching local footprints on clients against a baseline footprint on the
server, we adaptively score each client and adjust its probability of being
selected each round so as to mitigate the impact of the clients with
low-quality data on the training process. We have conducted extensive
experiments on public data sets using various FL settings. The results show
that FedProf effectively reduces the number of communication rounds and overall
time (providing up to 4.5x speedup) for the global model to converge while
improving the accuracy of the final global model.</span>

robustness metrics specialized for semantic segmentation. The novelty of our
proposal is to move beyond pixel-level metrics: Given two images with each
having N pixels being class-flipped, the designed metrics should, depending on
the clustering of pixels being class-flipped or the location of occurrence,
reflect a different level of safety criticality. The result evaluated on an
autonomous driving dataset demonstrates the validity and practicality of our

yields optimal predictions among linear averages. We show that stacking is most
effective when model predictive performance is heterogeneous in inputs, and we
can further improve the stacked mixture with a hierarchical model. We
generalize stacking to Bayesian hierarchical stacking. The model weights are
varying as a function of data, partially-pooled, and inferred using Bayesian
inference. We further incorporate discrete and continuous inputs, other
structured priors, and time series and longitudinal data. To verify the
performance gain of the proposed method, we derive theory bounds, and

                    <span>The popularity of multimodal sensors and the accessibility of the Internet
have brought us a massive amount of unlabeled multimodal data. Since existing
datasets and well-trained models are primarily unimodal, the modality gap
between a unimodal network and unlabeled multimodal data poses an interesting
problem: how to transfer a pre-trained unimodal network to perform the same
task on unlabeled multimodal data? In this work, we propose multimodal
knowledge expansion (MKE), a knowledge distillation-based framework to
effectively utilize multimodal data without requiring labels. Opposite to
traditional knowledge distillation, where the student is designed to be
lightweight and inferior to the teacher, we observe that a multimodal student
model consistently denoises pseudo labels and generalizes better than its
teacher. Extensive experiments on four tasks and different modalities verify
this finding. Furthermore, we connect the mechanism of MKE to semi-supervised
learning and offer both empirical and theoretical explanations to understand
the denoising capability of a multimodal student.</span>

                    <span>Deep learning (DL) has achieved unprecedented success in a variety of tasks.
However, DL systems are notoriously difficult to test and debug due to the lack
of explainability of DL models and the huge test input space to cover.
Generally speaking, it is relatively easy to collect a massive amount of test
data, but the labeling cost can be quite high. Consequently, it is essential to
conduct test selection and label only those selected &quot;high quality&quot;
bug-revealing test inputs for test cost reduction.

In this paper, we propose a novel test prioritization technique that brings
order into the unlabeled test instances according to their bug-revealing
capabilities, namely TestRank. Different from existing solutions, TestRank
leverages both intrinsic attributes and contextual attributes of test instances
when prioritizing them. To be specific, we first build a similarity graph on
test instances and training samples, and we conduct graph-based semi-supervised
learning to extract contextual features. Then, for a particular test instance,
the contextual features extracted from the graph neural network (GNN) and the
intrinsic features obtained with the DL model itself are combined to predict
its bug-revealing probability. Finally, TestRank prioritizes unlabeled test
instances in descending order of the above probability value. We evaluate the
performance of TestRank on a variety of image classification datasets.
Experimental results show that the debugging efficiency of our method
significantly outperforms existing test prioritization techniques.</span>

decade. Due to the lack of a comprehensive and topic widely covered survey for

categorizing them into groups such as brain-computer interface, disease
detection, and emotion recognition. They are followed by the discussion, in

and challenges for deep learning in EEG are proposed. We hope that this paper

baseline&#x27;s test accuracy in different datasets. Experiments on Open Graph

                    <span>To make a modular robotic system both capable and scalable, the controller
must be equally as modular as the mechanism. Given the large number of designs
that can be generated from even a small set of modules, it becomes impractical
to create a new system-wide controller for each design. Instead, we construct a
modular control policy that handles a broad class of designs. We take the view
that a module is both form and function, i.e. both mechanism and controller. As
the modules are physically re-configured, the policy automatically
re-configures to match the kinematic structure. This novel policy is trained
with a new model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, which interleaves
model learning and trajectory optimization to guide policy learning for
multiple designs simultaneously. Training the policy on a varied set of designs
teaches it how to adapt its behavior to the design. We show that the policy can
then generalize to a larger set of designs not seen during training. We
demonstrate one policy controlling many designs with different combinations of
legs and wheels to locomote both in simulation and on real robots.</span>

                    <span>In real world settings, numerous constraints are present which are hard to
specify mathematically. However, for the real world deployment of reinforcement
learning (RL), it is critical that RL agents are aware of these constraints, so
that they can act safely. In this work, we consider the problem of learning
constraints from demonstrations of a constraint-abiding agent&#x27;s behavior. We
experimentally validate our approach and show that our framework can
successfully learn the most likely constraints that the agent respects. We
further show that these learned constraints are \textit{transferable} to new
agents that may have different morphologies and/or reward functions. Previous
works in this regard have either mainly been restricted to tabular (discrete)
settings, specific types of constraints or assume the environment&#x27;s transition
dynamics. In contrast, our framework is able to learn arbitrary
\textit{Markovian} constraints in high-dimensions in a completely model-free
setting. The code can be found it:

                    <span>Imitation learning seeks to circumvent the difficulty in designing proper
reward functions for training agents by utilizing expert behavior. With
environments modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDP), most of the existing
imitation algorithms are contingent on the availability of expert
demonstrations in the same MDP as the one in which a new imitation policy is to
be learned. In this paper, we study the problem of how to imitate tasks when
there exist discrepancies between the expert and agent MDP. These discrepancies
across domains could include differing dynamics, viewpoint, or morphology; we
present a novel framework to learn correspondences across such domains.
Importantly, in contrast to prior works, we use unpaired and unaligned
trajectories containing only states in the expert domain, to learn this
correspondence. We utilize a cycle-consistency constraint on both the state
space and a domain agnostic latent space to do this. In addition, we enforce
consistency on the temporal position of states via a normalized position
estimator function, to align the trajectories across the two domains. Once this
correspondence is found, we can directly transfer the demonstrations on one
domain to the other and use it for imitation. Experiments across a wide variety
of challenging domains demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.</span>

                    <span>Understanding the behavior of learned classifiers is an important task, and
various black-box explanations, logical reasoning approaches, and
model-specific methods have been proposed. In this paper, we introduce
probabilistic sufficient explanations, which formulate explaining an instance
of classification as choosing the &quot;simplest&quot; subset of features such that only
observing those features is &quot;sufficient&quot; to explain the classification. That
is, sufficient to give us strong probabilistic guarantees that the model will
behave similarly when all features are observed under the data distribution. In
addition, we leverage tractable probabilistic reasoning tools such as
probabilistic circuits and expected predictions to design a scalable algorithm
for finding the desired explanations while keeping the guarantees intact. Our
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in finding
sufficient explanations, and showcase its advantages compared to Anchors and
logical explanations.</span>

                    <span>Oxygen consumption (VO$_2$) provides established clinical and physiological
indicators of cardiorespiratory function and exercise capacity. However, VO$_2$
monitoring is largely limited to specialized laboratory settings, making its
widespread monitoring elusive. Here, we investigate temporal prediction of
VO$_2$ from wearable sensors during cycle ergometer exercise using a temporal
convolutional network (TCN). Cardiorespiratory signals were acquired from a
smart shirt with integrated textile sensors alongside ground-truth VO$_2$ from
a metabolic system on twenty-two young healthy adults. Participants performed
one ramp-incremental and three pseudorandom binary sequence exercise protocols
to assess a range of VO$_2$ dynamics. A TCN model was developed using causal
convolutions across an effective history length to model the time-dependent
nature of VO$_2$. Optimal history length was determined through minimum
validation loss across hyperparameter values. The best performing model encoded
218 s history length (TCN-VO$_2$ A), with 187 s, 97 s, and 76 s yielding less
than 3% deviation from the optimal validation loss. TCN-VO$_2$ A showed strong
prediction accuracy (mean, 95% CI) across all exercise intensities (-22
ml.min$^{-1}$, [-262, 218]), spanning transitions from low-moderate (-23
ml.min$^{-1}$, [-250, 204]), low-heavy (14 ml.min$^{-1}$, [-252, 280]),
ventilatory threshold-heavy (-49 ml.min$^{-1}$, [-274, 176]), and maximal (-32
ml.min$^{-1}$, [-261, 197]) exercise. Second-by-second classification of
physical activity across 16090 s of predicted VO$_2$ was able to discern
between vigorous, moderate, and light activity with high accuracy (94.1%). This
system enables quantitative aerobic activity monitoring in non-laboratory
settings across a range of exercise intensities using wearable sensors for
monitoring exercise prescription adherence and personal fitness.</span>

                    <span>Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a prevalent optimization technique for
large-scale distributed machine learning. While SGD computation can be
efficiently divided between multiple machines, communication typically becomes
a bottleneck in the distributed setting. Gradient compression methods can be
used to alleviate this problem, and a recent line of work shows that SGD
augmented with gradient compression converges to an $\varepsilon$-first-order
stationary point. In this paper we extend these results to convergence to an
$\varepsilon$-second-order stationary point ($\varepsilon$-SOSP), which is to
the best of our knowledge the first result of this type. In addition, we show
that, when the stochastic gradient is not Lipschitz, compressed SGD with
RandomK compressor converges to an $\varepsilon$-SOSP with the same number of
iterations as uncompressed SGD [Jin et al.,2021] (JACM), while improving the
total communication by a factor of $\tilde \Theta(\sqrt{d}
\varepsilon^{-3/4})$, where $d$ is the dimension of the optimization problem.
We present additional results for the cases when the compressor is arbitrary
and when the stochastic gradient is Lipschitz.</span>

                    <span>In this work we study the problem of measuring the fairness of a machine
learning model under noisy information. Focusing on group fairness metrics, we
investigate the particular but common situation when the evaluation requires
controlling for the confounding effect of covariate variables. In a practical
setting, we might not be able to jointly observe the covariate and group
information, and a standard workaround is to then use proxies for one or more
of these variables. Prior works have demonstrated the challenges with using a
proxy for sensitive attributes, and strong independence assumptions are needed
to provide guarantees on the accuracy of the noisy estimates. In contrast, in
this work we study using a proxy for the covariate variable and present a
theoretical analysis that aims to characterize weaker conditions under which
accurate fairness evaluation is possible.

Furthermore, our theory identifies potential sources of errors and decouples
them into two interpretable parts $\gamma$ and $\epsilon$. The first part
$\gamma$ depends solely on the performance of the proxy such as precision and
recall, whereas the second part $\epsilon$ captures correlations between all
the variables of interest. We show that in many scenarios the error in the
estimates is dominated by $\gamma$ via a linear dependence, whereas the
dependence on the correlations $\epsilon$ only constitutes a lower order term.
As a result we expand the understanding of scenarios where measuring model
fairness via proxies can be an effective approach. Finally, we compare, via
simulations, the theoretical upper-bounds to the distribution of simulated
estimation errors and show that assuming some structure on the data, even weak,
is key to significantly improve both theoretical guarantees and empirical
results.</span>

                    <span>This work studies the statistical limits of uniform convergence for offline
policy evaluation (OPE) problems with model-based methods (for finite horizon
MDP) and provides a unified view towards optimal learning for several
well-motivated offline tasks. Uniform OPE
$\sup_\Pi|Q^\pi-\hat{Q}^\pi|&lt;\epsilon$ (initiated by \citet{yin2021near}) is a
stronger measure than the point-wise (fixed policy) OPE and ensures offline
policy learning when $\Pi$ contains all policies (global policy class). In this
paper, we establish an $\Omega(H^2 S/d_m\epsilon^2)$ lower bound (over
model-based family) for the global uniform OPE, where $d_m$ is the minimal
state-action probability induced by the behavior policy. Next, our main result
establishes an episode complexity of $\tilde{O}(H^2/d_m\epsilon^2)$ for
\emph{local} uniform convergence that applies to all \emph{near-empirically
optimal} policies for the MDPs with \emph{stationary} transition. This result
implies the optimal sample complexity for offline learning and separates the
local uniform OPE from the global case due to the extra $S$ factor.
Paramountly, the model-based method combining with our new analysis technique
(singleton absorbing MDP) can be adapted to the new settings: offline
task-agnostic and the offline reward-free with optimal complexity
$\tilde{O}(H^2\log(K)/d_m\epsilon^2)$ ($K$ is the number of tasks) and
$\tilde{O}(H^2S/d_m\epsilon^2)$ respectively, which provides a unified
framework for simultaneously solving different offline RL problems.</span>

                    <span>This paper introduces a generative model for planar point processes in a
square window, built upon a single realization of a stationary, ergodic point
process observed in this window. Inspired by recent advances in gradient
descent methods for maximum entropy models, we propose a method to generate
similar point patterns by jointly moving particles of an initial Poisson
configuration towards a target counting measure. The target measure is
generated via a deterministic gradient descent algorithm, so as to match a set
of statistics of the given, observed realization. Our statistics are estimators
of the multi-scale wavelet phase harmonic covariance, recently proposed in
image modeling. They allow one to capture geometric structures through
multi-scale interactions between wavelet coefficients. Both our statistics and
the gradient descent algorithm scale better with the number of observed points
than the classical k-nearest neighbour distances previously used in generative
models for point processes, based on the rejection sampling or
simulated-annealing. The overall quality of our model is evaluated on point
processes with various geometric structures through spectral and topological
data analysis.</span>

                    <span>This work addresses the problem of optimizing communications between server
and clients in federated learning (FL). Current sampling approaches in FL are
either biased, or non optimal in terms of server-clients communications and
training stability. To overcome this issue, we introduce \textit{clustered
sampling} for clients selection. We prove that clustered sampling leads to
better clients representatitivity and to reduced variance of the clients
stochastic aggregation weights in FL. Compatibly with our theory, we provide
two different clustering approaches enabling clients aggregation based on 1)
sample size, and 2) models similarity. Through a series of experiments in
non-iid and unbalanced scenarios, we demonstrate that model aggregation through
clustered sampling consistently leads to better training convergence and
variability when compared to standard sampling approaches. Our approach does
not require any additional operation on the clients side, and can be seamlessly
integrated in standard FL implementations. Finally, clustered sampling is
compatible with existing methods and technologies for privacy enhancement, and
for communication reduction through model compression.</span>

                    <span>Quantifying uncertainty in a model&#x27;s predictions is important as it enables
the safety of an AI system to be increased by acting on the model&#x27;s output in
an informed manner. This is crucial for applications where the cost of an error
is high, such as in autonomous vehicle control, medical image analysis,
financial estimations or legal fields. Deep Neural Networks are powerful
predictors that have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide
spectrum of tasks. Quantifying predictive uncertainty in DNNs is a challenging
and yet on-going problem. In this paper we propose a complete framework to
capture and quantify all of these three types of uncertainties in DNNs for
image classification. This framework includes an ensemble of CNNs for model
uncertainty, a supervised reconstruction auto-encoder to capture distributional
uncertainty and using the output of activation functions in the last layer of
the network, to capture data uncertainty. Finally we demonstrate the efficiency
of our method on popular image datasets for classification.</span>

                    <span>Negative control is a strategy for learning the causal relationship between
treatment and outcome in the presence of unmeasured confounding. The treatment
effect can nonetheless be identified if two auxiliary variables are available:
a negative control treatment (which has no effect on the actual outcome), and a
negative control outcome (which is not affected by the actual treatment). These
auxiliary variables can also be viewed as proxies for a traditional set of
control variables, and they bear resemblance to instrumental variables. I
propose a family of algorithms based on kernel ridge regression for learning
nonparametric treatment effects with negative controls. Examples include dose
response curves, dose response curves with distribution shift, and
heterogeneous treatment effects. Data may be discrete or continuous, and low,
high, or infinite dimensional. I prove uniform consistency and provide finite
sample rates of convergence. I estimate the dose response curve of cigarette
smoking on infant birth weight adjusting for unobserved confounding due to
household income, using a data set of singleton births in the state of
Pennsylvania between 1989 and 1991.</span>

                    <span>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are one of the greatest advances in AI
in recent years. With their ability to directly learn the probability
distribution of data, and then sample synthetic realistic data. Many
applications have emerged, using GANs to solve classical problems in machine
learning, such as data augmentation, class unbalance problems, and fair
representation learning. In this paper, we analyze and highlight fairness
concerns of GANs model. In this regard, we show empirically that GANs models
may inherently prefer certain groups during the training process and therefore
they&#x27;re not able to homogeneously generate data from different groups during
the testing phase. Furthermore, we propose solutions to solve this issue by
conditioning the GAN model towards samples&#x27; group or using ensemble method
(boosting) to allow the GAN model to leverage distributed structure of data
during the training phase and generate groups at equal rate during the testing
phase.</span>

                    <span>Our life is getting filled by Internet of Things (IoT) devices. These devices
often rely on closed or poorly documented protocols, with unknown formats and
semantics. Learning how to interact with such devices in an autonomous manner
is the key for interoperability and automatic verification of their
capabilities. In this paper, we propose RL-IoT, a system that explores how to
automatically interact with possibly unknown IoT devices. We leverage
reinforcement learning (RL) to recover the semantics of protocol messages and
to take control of the device to reach a given goal, while minimizing the
number of interactions. We assume to know only a database of possible IoT
protocol messages, whose semantics are however unknown. RL-IoT exchanges
messages with the target IoT device, learning those commands that are useful to
reach the given goal. Our results show that RL-IoT is able to solve both simple
and complex tasks. With properly tuned parameters, RL-IoT learns how to perform
actions with the target device, a Yeelight smart bulb in our case study,
completing non-trivial patterns with as few as 400 interactions. RL-IoT paves
the road for automatic interactions with poorly documented IoT protocols, thus
enabling interoperable systems.</span>

                    <span>This paper gives a k-means approximation algorithm that is efficient in the
relational algorithms model. This is an algorithm that operates directly on a
relational database without performing a join to convert it to a matrix whose
rows represent the data points. The running time is potentially exponentially
smaller than $N$, the number of data points to be clustered that the relational
database represents.

Few relational algorithms are known and this paper offers techniques for
designing relational algorithms as well as characterizing their limitations. We
show that given two data points as cluster centers, if we cluster points
according to their closest centers, it is NP-Hard to approximate the number of
points in the clusters on a general relational input. This is trivial for
conventional data inputs and this result exemplifies that standard algorithmic
techniques may not be directly applied when designing an efficient relational
algorithm. This paper then introduces a new method that leverages rejection
sampling and the $k$-means++ algorithm to construct an O(1)-approximate k-means
solution.</span>

                    <span>Stroke is known as a major global health problem, and for stroke survivors it
is key to monitor the recovery levels. However, traditional stroke
rehabilitation assessment methods (such as the popular clinical assessment) can
be subjective and expensive, and it is also less convenient for patients to
visit clinics in a high frequency. To address this issue, in this work based on
wearable sensing and machine learning techniques, we developed an automated
system that can predict the assessment score in an objective manner. With
wrist-worn sensors, accelerometer data was collected from 59 stroke survivors
in free-living environments for a duration of 8 weeks, and we aim to map the
week-wise accelerometer data (3 days per week) to the assessment score by
developing signal processing and predictive model pipeline. To achieve this, we
proposed two types of new features, which can encode the rehabilitation
information from both paralysed/non-paralysed sides while suppressing the
high-level noises such as irrelevant daily activities. Based on the proposed
features, we further developed the longitudinal mixed-effects model with
Gaussian process prior (LMGP), which can model the random effects caused by
different subjects and time slots (during the 8 weeks). Comprehensive
experiments were conducted to evaluate our system on both acute and chronic
patients, and the results suggested its effectiveness.</span>

                    <span>Many defenses have recently been proposed at venues like NIPS, ICML, ICLR and
CVPR. These defenses are mainly focused on mitigating white-box attacks. They
do not properly examine black-box attacks. In this paper, we expand upon the
analysis of these defenses to include adaptive black-box adversaries. Our
evaluation is done on nine defenses including Barrage of Random Transforms,
ComDefend, Ensemble Diversity, Feature Distillation, The Odds are Odd, Error
Correcting Codes, Distribution Classifier Defense, K-Winner Take All and Buffer
Zones. Our investigation is done using two black-box adversarial models and six
widely studied adversarial attacks for CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Our
analyses show most recent defenses (7 out of 9) provide only marginal
improvements in security ($&lt;25\%$), as compared to undefended networks. For
every defense, we also show the relationship between the amount of data the
adversary has at their disposal, and the effectiveness of adaptive black-box
attacks. Overall, our results paint a clear picture: defenses need both
thorough white-box and black-box analyses to be considered secure. We provide
this large scale study and analyses to motivate the field to move towards the
development of more robust black-box defenses.</span>

                    <span>The issue of potential privacy leakage during centralized AI&#x27;s model training
has drawn intensive concern from the public. A Parallel and Distributed
Computing (or PDC) scheme, termed Federated Learning (FL), has emerged as a new
paradigm to cope with the privacy issue by allowing clients to perform model
training locally, without the necessity to upload their personal sensitive
data. In FL, the number of clients could be sufficiently large, but the
bandwidth available for model distribution and re-upload is quite limited,
making it sensible to only involve part of the volunteers to participate in the
training process. The client selection policy is critical to an FL process in
terms of training efficiency, the final model&#x27;s quality as well as fairness. In
this paper, we will model the fairness guaranteed client selection as a
Lyapunov optimization problem and then a C2MAB-based method is proposed for
estimation of the model exchange time between each client and the server, based
on which we design a fairness guaranteed algorithm termed RBCS-F for
problem-solving. The regret of RBCS-F is strictly bounded by a finite constant,
justifying its theoretical feasibility. Barring the theoretical results, more
empirical data can be derived from our real training experiments on public
datasets.</span>

                    <span>Constraint-based methods are one of the main approaches for causal structure
learning that are particularly valued as they are asymptotically guaranteed to
find a structure that is Markov equivalent to the causal graph of the system.
On the other hand, they may require an exponentially large number of
conditional independence (CI) tests in the number of variables of the system.
In this paper, we propose a novel recursive constraint-based method for causal
structure learning that significantly reduces the required number of CI tests
compared to the existing literature. The idea of the proposed approach is to
use Markov boundary information to identify a specific variable that can be
removed from the set of variables without affecting the statistical
dependencies among the other variables. Having identified such a variable, we
discover its neighborhood, remove that variable from the set of variables, and
recursively learn the causal structure over the remaining variables. We further
provide a lower bound on the number of CI tests required by any
constraint-based method. Comparing this lower bound to our achievable bound
demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed approach. Our experimental results
show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art both on synthetic
and real-world structures.</span>

                    <span>Automated unit test case generation tools facilitate test-driven development
and support developers by suggesting tests intended to identify flaws in their
code. Existing approaches are usually guided by the test coverage criteria,
generating synthetic test cases that are often difficult for developers to read
or understand. In this paper we propose AthenaTest, an approach that aims to
generate unit test cases by learning from real-world focal methods and
developer-written testcases. We formulate unit test case generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning task, adopting a two-step training procedure
consisting of denoising pretraining on a large unsupervised Java corpus, and
supervised finetuning for a downstream translation task of generating unit
tests. We investigate the impact of natural language and source code
pretraining, as well as the focal context information surrounding the focal
method. Both techniques provide improvements in terms of validation loss, with
pretraining yielding 25% relative improvement and focal context providing
additional 11.1% improvement. We also introduce Methods2Test, the largest
publicly available supervised parallel corpus of unit test case methods and
corresponding focal methods in Java, which comprises 780K test cases mined from
91K open-source repositories from GitHub. We evaluate AthenaTest on five
defects4j projects, generating 25K passing test cases covering 43.7% of the
focal methods with only 30 attempts. We execute the test cases, collect test
coverage information, and compare them with test cases generated by EvoSuite
and GPT-3, finding that our approach outperforms GPT-3 and has comparable
coverage w.r.t. EvoSuite. Finally, we survey professional developers on their
preference in terms of readability, understandability, and testing
effectiveness of the generated tests, showing overwhelmingly preference towards
AthenaTest.</span>

communication-efficient variants of stochastic gradient descent that can be
deployed to perform parallel model training. One popular
communication-compression method for data-parallel SGD is QSGD (Alistarh et
al., 2017), which quantizes and encodes gradients to reduce communication
costs. The baseline variant of QSGD provides strong theoretical guarantees,
however, for practical purposes, the authors proposed a heuristic variant which
we call QSGDinf, which demonstrated impressive empirical gains for distributed
training of large neural networks. In this paper, we build on this work to
propose a new gradient quantization scheme, and show that it has both stronger
theoretical guarantees than QSGD, and matches and exceeds the empirical
performance of the QSGDinf heuristic and of other compression methods.</span>

                    <span>The existing low-memory BLS implementation proposed recently avoids the need
for storing and inverting large matrices, to achieve efficient usage of
memories. However, the existing low-memory BLS implementation sacrifices the
testing accuracy as a price for efficient usage of memories, since it can no
longer obtain the generalized inverse or ridge solution for the output weights
during incremental learning, and it cannot work under the very small ridge
parameter that is utilized in the original BLS. Accordingly, it is required to
develop the low-memory BLS implementations, which can work under very small
ridge parameters and compute the generalized inverse or ridge solution for the
output weights in the process of incremental learning. In this paper, firstly
we propose the low-memory implementations for the recently proposed recursive
and square-root BLS algorithms on added inputs and the recently proposed
squareroot BLS algorithm on added nodes, by simply processing a batch of inputs
or nodes in each recursion. Since the recursive BLS implementation includes the
recursive updates of the inverse matrix that may introduce numerical
instabilities after a large number of iterations, and needs the extra
computational load to decompose the inverse matrix into the Cholesky factor
when cooperating with the proposed low-memory implementation of the square-root
BLS algorithm on added nodes, we only improve the low-memory implementations of
the square-root BLS algorithms on added inputs and nodes, to propose the full
lowmemory implementation of the square-root BLS algorithm. All the proposed
low-memory BLS implementations compute the ridge solution for the output
weights in the process of incremental learning, and most of them can work under
very small ridge parameters.</span>

                    <span>In causal graphical models based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), directed
paths represent causal pathways between the corresponding variables. The
variable at the beginning of such a path is referred to as an ancestor of the
variable at the end of the path. Ancestral relations between variables play an
important role in causal modeling. In existing literature on structure
learning, these relations are usually deduced from learned structures and used
for orienting edges or formulating constraints of the space of possible DAGs.
However, they are usually not posed as immediate target of inference. In this
work we investigate the graphical characterization of ancestral relations via
CPDAGs and d-separation relations. We propose a framework that can learn
definite non-ancestral relations without first learning the skeleton. This
frame-work yields structural information that can be used in both score- and
constraint-based algorithms to learn causal DAGs more efficiently.</span>

                    <span>Train machine learning models on sensitive user data has raised increasing
privacy concerns in many areas. Federated learning is a popular approach for
privacy protection that collects the local gradient information instead of real
data. One way to achieve a strict privacy guarantee is to apply local
differential privacy into federated learning. However, previous works do not
give a practical solution due to three issues. First, the noisy data is close
to its original value with high probability, increasing the risk of information
exposure. Second, a large variance is introduced to the estimated average,
causing poor accuracy. Last, the privacy budget explodes due to the high
dimensionality of weights in deep learning models. In this paper, we proposed a
novel design of local differential privacy mechanism for federated learning to
address the abovementioned issues. It is capable of making the data more
distinct from its original value and introducing lower variance. Moreover, the
proposed mechanism bypasses the curse of dimensionality by splitting and
shuffling model updates. A series of empirical evaluations on three commonly
used datasets, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10, demonstrate that our solution
can not only achieve superior deep learning performance but also provide a
strong privacy guarantee at the same time.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we consider hybrid parallelism -- a paradigm that employs both
Data Parallelism (DP) and Model Parallelism (MP) -- to scale distributed
training of large recommendation models. We propose a compression framework
called Dynamic Communication Thresholding (DCT) for communication-efficient
hybrid training. DCT filters the entities to be communicated across the network
through a simple hard-thresholding function, allowing only the most relevant
information to pass through. For communication efficient DP, DCT compresses the
parameter gradients sent to the parameter server during model synchronization.
The threshold is updated only once every few thousand iterations to reduce the
computational overhead of compression. For communication efficient MP, DCT
incorporates a novel technique to compress the activations and gradients sent
across the network during the forward and backward propagation, respectively.
This is done by identifying and updating only the most relevant neurons of the
neural network for each training sample in the data. We evaluate DCT on
publicly available natural language processing and recommender models and
datasets, as well as recommendation systems used in production at Facebook. DCT
reduces communication by at least $100\times$ and $20\times$ during DP and MP,
respectively. The algorithm has been deployed in production, and it improves
end-to-end training time for a state-of-the-art industrial recommender model by
37\%, without any loss in performance.</span>

                    <span>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a class of generative models with
two antagonistic neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. These two
neural networks compete against each other through an adversarial process that
can be modeled as a stochastic Nash equilibrium problem. Since the associated
training process is challenging, it is fundamental to design reliable
algorithms to compute an equilibrium. In this paper, we propose a stochastic
relaxed forward-backward (SRFB) algorithm for GANs and we show convergence to
an exact solution when an increasing number of data is available. We also show
convergence of an averaged variant of the SRFB algorithm to a neighborhood of
the solution when only few samples are available. In both cases, convergence is
guaranteed when the pseudogradient mapping of the game is monotone. This
assumption is among the weakest known in the literature. Moreover, we apply our
algorithm to the image generation problem.</span>

compromising predicting ability of a network. Many algorithms have been
developed for pruning both over-parameterized fully-connected networks (FCNs)
and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but analytical studies of
capabilities and compression ratios of such pruned sub-networks are lacking. We
theoretically study the performance of two pruning techniques (random and
magnitude-based) on FCNs and CNNs. Given a target network {whose weights are
independently sampled from appropriate distributions}, we provide a universal
approach to bound the gap between a pruned and the target network in a
probabilistic sense. The results establish that there exist pruned networks
with expressive power within any specified bound from the target network.</span>

                    <span>Recently, there has been substantial progress in image synthesis from
semantic labelmaps. However, methods used for this task assume the availability
of complete and unambiguous labelmaps, with instance boundaries of objects, and
class labels for each pixel. This reliance on heavily annotated inputs
restricts the application of image synthesis techniques to real-world
applications, especially under uncertainty due to weather, occlusion, or noise.
On the other hand, algorithms that can synthesize images from sparse labelmaps
or sketches are highly desirable as tools that can guide content creators and
artists to quickly generate scenes by simply specifying locations of a few
objects. In this paper, we address the problem of complex scene completion from
sparse labelmaps. Under this setting, very few details about the scene (30\% of
object instances) are available as input for image synthesis. We propose a
two-stage deep network based method, called &#x60;Halluci-Net&#x27;, that learns
co-occurence relationships between objects in scenes, and then exploits these
relationships to produce a dense and complete labelmap. The generated dense
labelmap can then be used as input by state-of-the-art image synthesis
techniques like pix2pixHD to obtain the final image. The proposed method is
evaluated on the Cityscapes dataset and it outperforms two baselines methods on
performance metrics like Fr\&#x27;echet Inception Distance (FID), semantic
segmentation accuracy, and similarity in object co-occurrences. We also show
qualitative results on a subset of ADE20K dataset that contains bedroom images.</span>

                    <span>Conventional federated learning directly averages model weights, which is
only possible for collaboration between models with homogeneous architectures.
Sharing prediction instead of weight removes this obstacle and eliminates the
risk of white-box inference attacks in conventional federated learning.
However, the predictions from local models are sensitive and would leak
training data privacy to the public. To address this issue, one naive approach
is adding the differentially private random noise to the predictions, which
however brings a substantial trade-off between privacy budget and model
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called FEDMD-NFDP,
which applies a Noise-Free Differential Privacy (NFDP) mechanism into a
federated model distillation framework. Our extensive experimental results on
various datasets validate that FEDMD-NFDP can deliver not only comparable
utility and communication efficiency but also provide a noise-free differential
privacy guarantee. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our FEDMD-NFDP by
considering both IID and non-IID setting, heterogeneous model architectures,
and unlabelled public datasets from a different distribution.</span>

                    <span>This paper introduces Non-Autonomous Input-Output Stable Network(NAIS-Net), a
very deep architecture where each stacked processing block is derived from a
time-invariant non-autonomous dynamical system. Non-autonomy is implemented by
skip connections from the block input to each of the unrolled processing stages
and allows stability to be enforced so that blocks can be unrolled adaptively
to a pattern-dependent processing depth. NAIS-Net induces non-trivial,
Lipschitz input-output maps, even for an infinite unroll length. We prove that
the network is globally asymptotically stable so that for every initial
condition there is exactly one input-dependent equilibrium assuming $tanh$
units, and incrementally stable for ReL units. An efficient implementation that
enforces the stability under derived conditions for both fully-connected and
convolutional layers is also presented. Experimental results show how NAIS-Net
exhibits stability in practice, yielding a significant reduction in
generalization gap compared to ResNets.</span>

                    <span>Single-Image Super Resolution (SISR) is a classical computer vision problem
and it has been studied for over decades. With the recent success of deep
learning methods, recent work on SISR focuses solutions with deep learning
methodologies and achieves state-of-the-art results. However most of the
state-of-the-art SISR methods contain millions of parameters and layers, which
limits their practical applications. In this paper, we propose a hardware
(Synaptics Dolphin NPU) limitation aware, extremely lightweight quantization
robust real-time super resolution network (XLSR). The proposed model&#x27;s building
block is inspired from root modules for Image classification. We successfully
applied root modules to SISR problem, further more to make the model uint8
quantization robust we used Clipped ReLU at the last layer of the network and
achieved great balance between reconstruction quality and runtime. Furthermore,
although the proposed network contains 30x fewer parameters than VDSR its
performance surpasses it on Div2K validation set. The network proved itself by
winning Mobile AI 2021 Real-Time Single Image Super Resolution Challenge.</span>

                    <span>Deep learning applications require global optimization of non-convex
objective functions, which have multiple local minima. The same problem is
often found in physical simulations and may be resolved by the methods of
Langevin dynamics with Simulated Annealing, which is a well-established
approach for minimization of many-particle potentials. This analogy provides
useful insights for non-convex stochastic optimization in machine learning.
Here we find that integration of the discretized Langevin equation gives a
coordinate updating rule equivalent to the famous Momentum optimization
algorithm. As a main result, we show that a gradual decrease of the momentum
coefficient from the initial value close to unity until zero is equivalent to
application of Simulated Annealing or slow cooling, in physical terms. Making
use of this novel approach, we propose CoolMomentum -- a new stochastic
optimization method. Applying Coolmomentum to optimization of Resnet-20 on
Cifar-10 dataset and Efficientnet-B0 on Imagenet, we demonstrate that it is
able to achieve high accuracies.</span>

                    <span>This survey presents an overview of integrating prior knowledge into machine
learning systems in order to improve explainability. The complexity of machine
learning models has elicited research to make them more explainable. However,
most explainability methods cannot provide insight beyond the given data,
requiring additional information about the context. We propose to harness prior
knowledge to improve upon the explanation capabilities of machine learning
models. In this paper, we present a categorization of current research into
three main categories which either integrate knowledge into the machine
learning pipeline, into the explainability method or derive knowledge from
explanations. To classify the papers, we build upon the existing taxonomy of
informed machine learning and extend it from the perspective of explainability.
We conclude with open challenges and research directions.</span>

                    <span>Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) enables the disaggregation of the global
power consumption of multiple loads, taken from a single smart electrical
meter, into appliance-level details. State-of-the-Art approaches are based on
Machine Learning methods and exploit the fusion of time- and frequency-domain
features from current and voltage sensors. Unfortunately, these methods are
compute-demanding and memory-intensive. Therefore, running low-latency NILM on
low-cost, resource-constrained MCU-based meters is currently an open challenge.
This paper addresses the optimization of the feature spaces as well as the
computational and storage cost reduction needed for executing State-of-the-Art
(SoA) NILM algorithms on memory- and compute-limited MCUs. We compare four
supervised learning techniques on different classification scenarios and
characterize the overall NILM pipeline&#x27;s implementation on a MCU-based Smart
Measurement Node. Experimental results demonstrate that optimizing the feature
space enables edge MCU-based NILM with 95.15% accuracy, resulting in a small
drop compared to the most-accurate feature vector deployment (96.19%) while
achieving up to 5.45x speed-up and 80.56% storage reduction. Furthermore, we
show that low-latency NILM relying only on current measurements reaches almost
80% accuracy, allowing a major cost reduction by removing voltage sensors from
the hardware design.</span>

                    <span>Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) is a powerful framework for tackling the
sparse coding problem while also providing uncertainty quantification. However,
the most popular inference algorithms for SBL become too expensive for
high-dimensional problems due to the need to maintain a large covariance
matrix. To resolve this issue, we introduce a new SBL inference algorithm that
avoids explicit computation of the covariance matrix, thereby saving
significant time and space. Instead of performing costly matrix inversions, our
covariance-free method solves multiple linear systems to obtain provably
unbiased estimates of the posterior statistics needed by SBL. These systems can
be solved in parallel, enabling further acceleration of the algorithm via
graphics processing units. In practice, our method can be up to thousands of
times faster than existing baselines, reducing hours of computation time to
seconds. We showcase how our new algorithm enables SBL to tractably tackle
high-dimensional signal recovery problems, such as deconvolution of calcium
imaging data and multi-contrast reconstruction of magnetic resonance images.
Finally, we open-source a toolbox containing all of our implementations to
drive future research in SBL.</span>

                    <span>This work attempts to provide a plausible theoretical framework that aims to
interpret modern deep (convolutional) networks from the principles of data
compression and discriminative representation. We show that for
high-dimensional multi-class data, the optimal linear discriminative
representation maximizes the coding rate difference between the whole dataset
and the average of all the subsets. We show that the basic iterative gradient
ascent scheme for optimizing the rate reduction objective naturally leads to a
multi-layer deep network, named ReduNet, that shares common characteristics of
modern deep networks. The deep layered architectures, linear and nonlinear
operators, and even parameters of the network are all explicitly constructed
layer-by-layer via forward propagation, instead of learned via back
propagation. All components of so-obtained &quot;white-box&quot; network have precise
optimization, statistical, and geometric interpretation. Moreover, all linear
operators of the so-derived network naturally become multi-channel convolutions
when we enforce classification to be rigorously shift-invariant. The derivation
also indicates that such a deep convolution network is significantly more
efficient to construct and learn in the spectral domain. Our preliminary
simulations and experiments clearly verify the effectiveness of both the rate
reduction objective and the associated ReduNet. All code and data are available

                    <span>Prior work has shown Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on
surrogate Computer Aided Design (CAD) models are able to detect and classify
real-world artefacts from photographs. The applications of which support
twinning of digital and physical assets in design, including rapid extraction
of part geometry from model repositories, information search \&amp; retrieval and
identifying components in the field for maintenance, repair, and recording. The
performance of CNNs in classification tasks have been shown dependent on
training data set size and number of classes. Where prior works have used
relatively small surrogate model data sets ($&lt;100$ models), the question
remains as to the ability of a CNN to differentiate between models in
increasingly large model repositories. This paper presents a method for
generating synthetic image data sets from online CAD model repositories, and
further investigates the capacity of an off-the-shelf CNN architecture trained
on synthetic data to classify models as class size increases. 1,000 CAD models
were curated and processed to generate large scale surrogate data sets,
featuring model coverage at steps of 10$^{\circ}$, 30$^{\circ}$, 60$^{\circ}$,
and 120$^{\circ}$ degrees. The findings demonstrate the capability of computer
vision algorithms to classify artefacts in model repositories of up to 200,
beyond this point the CNN&#x27;s performance is observed to deteriorate
significantly, limiting its present ability for automated twinning of physical
to digital artefacts. Although, a match is more often found in the top-5
results showing potential for information search and retrieval on large

                    <span>Vision transformers (ViT) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various machine vision problems. These models are based on multi-head
self-attention mechanisms that can flexibly attend to a sequence of image
patches to encode contextual cues. An important question is how such
flexibility in attending image-wide context conditioned on a given patch can
facilitate handling nuisances in natural images e.g., severe occlusions, domain
shifts, spatial permutations, adversarial and natural perturbations. We
systematically study this question via an extensive set of experiments
encompassing three ViT families and comparisons with a high-performing
convolutional neural network (CNN). We show and analyze the following
intriguing properties of ViT: (a) Transformers are highly robust to severe
occlusions, perturbations and domain shifts, e.g., retain as high as 60% top-1
accuracy on ImageNet even after randomly occluding 80% of the image content.
(b) The robust performance to occlusions is not due to a bias towards local
textures, and ViTs are significantly less biased towards textures compared to
CNNs. When properly trained to encode shape-based features, ViTs demonstrate
shape recognition capability comparable to that of human visual system,
previously unmatched in the literature. (c) Using ViTs to encode shape
representation leads to an interesting consequence of accurate semantic
segmentation without pixel-level supervision. (d) Off-the-shelf features from a
single ViT model can be combined to create a feature ensemble, leading to high
accuracy rates across a range of classification datasets in both traditional
and few-shot learning paradigms. We show effective features of ViTs are due to
flexible and dynamic receptive fields possible via the self-attention
mechanism.</span>

                    <span>Understanding the impact of data structure on the computational tractability
of learning is a key challenge for the theory of neural networks. Many
theoretical works do not explicitly model training data, or assume that inputs
are drawn component-wise independently from some simple probability
distribution. Here, we go beyond this simple paradigm by studying the
performance of neural networks trained on data drawn from pre-trained
generative models. This is possible due to a Gaussian equivalence stating that
the key metrics of interest, such as the training and test errors, can be fully
captured by an appropriately chosen Gaussian model. We provide three strands of
rigorous, analytical and numerical evidence corroborating this equivalence.
First, we establish rigorous conditions for the Gaussian equivalence to hold in
the case of single-layer generative models, as well as deterministic rates for
convergence in distribution. Second, we leverage this equivalence to derive a
closed set of equations describing the generalisation performance of two widely
studied machine learning problems: two-layer neural networks trained using
one-pass stochastic gradient descent, and full-batch pre-learned features or
kernel methods. Finally, we perform experiments demonstrating how our theory
applies to deep, pre-trained generative models. These results open a viable
path to the theoretical study of machine learning models with realistic data.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we consider online continuous DR-submodular maximization with
linear stochastic long-term constraints. Compared to the prior work on online
submodular maximization, our setting introduces the extra complication of
stochastic linear constraint functions that are i.i.d. generated at each round.
To be precise, at step $t\in\{1,\dots,T\}$, a DR-submodular utility function
$f_t(\cdot)$ and a constraint vector $p_t$, i.i.d. generated from an unknown
distribution with mean $p$, are revealed after committing to an action $x_t$
and we aim to maximize the overall utility while the expected cumulative
resource consumption $\sum_{t&#x3D;1}^T \langle p,x_t\rangle$ is below a fixed
budget $B_T$. Stochastic long-term constraints arise naturally in applications
where there is a limited budget or resource available and resource consumption
at each step is governed by stochastically time-varying environments. We
propose the Online Lagrangian Frank-Wolfe (OLFW) algorithm to solve this class
of online problems. We analyze the performance of the OLFW algorithm and we
obtain sub-linear regret bounds as well as sub-linear cumulative constraint
violation bounds, both in expectation and with high probability.</span>

                    <span>The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect phishing emails is
primarily dependent on large-scale centralized datasets, which opens it up to a
myriad of privacy, trust, and legal issues. Moreover, organizations are loathed
to share emails, given the risk of leakage of commercially sensitive
information. So, it is uncommon to obtain sufficient emails to train a global
AI model efficiently. Accordingly, privacy-preserving distributed and
collaborative machine learning, particularly Federated Learning (FL), is a
desideratum. Already prevalent in the healthcare sector, questions remain
regarding the effectiveness and efficacy of FL-based phishing detection within
the context of multi-organization collaborations. To the best of our knowledge,
the work herein is the first to investigate the use of FL in email
anti-phishing. This paper builds upon a deep neural network model, particularly
RNN and BERT for phishing email detection. It analyzes the FL-entangled
learning performance under various settings, including balanced and
asymmetrical data distribution. Our results corroborate comparable performance
statistics of FL in phishing email detection to centralized learning for
balanced datasets, and low organization counts. Moreover, we observe a
variation in performance when increasing organizational counts. For a fixed
total email dataset, the global RNN based model suffers by a 1.8% accuracy drop
when increasing organizational counts from 2 to 10. In contrast, BERT accuracy
rises by 0.6% when going from 2 to 5 organizations. However, if we allow
increasing the overall email dataset with the introduction of new organizations
in the FL framework, the organizational level performance is improved by
achieving a faster convergence speed. Besides, FL suffers in its overall global
model performance due to highly unstable outputs if the email dataset
distribution is highly asymmetric.</span>

                    <span>This paper presents a distributed scalable multi-robot planning algorithm for
non-uniform sampling of quasi-static spatial fields. We address the problem of
efficient data collection using multiple autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we
are interested in analyzing the effect of communication between multiple
robots, acting independently, on the overall sampling performance of the team.
Our focus is on distributed sampling problem where the robots are operating
independent of their teammates, but have the ability to communicate their
states to other neighbors with a constraint on the communication range. We
design and apply an informed non-myopic path planning technique on multiple
robotic platforms to efficiently collect measurements from a spatial field. Our
proposed approach is highly adaptive to challenging environments, growing team
size, and runs in real-time, which are the key features for any real-world
scenario. The results show that our distributed sampling approach is able to
achieve efficient sampling with minimal communication between the robots. We
evaluate our approach in simulation over multiple distributions commonly
occurring in nature and on the real-world data collected during a field trial.</span>

                    <span>Over the last few years, we have seen increasing data generated from
non-Euclidean domains, which are usually represented as graphs with complex
relationships, and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have gained a high interest
because of their potential in processing graph-structured data. In particular,
there is a strong interest in exploring the possibilities in performing
convolution on graphs using an extension of the GNN architecture, generally
referred to as Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN). Convolution on
graphs has been achieved mainly in two forms: spectral and spatial
convolutions. Due to the higher flexibility in exploring and exploiting the
graph structure of data, recently, there is an increasing interest in
investigating the possibilities that the spatial approach can offer. The idea
of finding a way to adapt the network behaviour to the inputs they process to
maximize the total performances has aroused much interest in the neural
networks literature over the years. This paper presents a novel method to adapt
the behaviour of a GCNN to the input proposing two ways to perform spatial
convolution on graphs using input-based filters which are dynamically
generated. Our model also investigates the problem of discovering and refining
relations among nodes. The experimental assessment confirms the capabilities of
the proposed approach, which achieves satisfying results using simple
architectures with a low number of filters.</span>

                    <span>In this work, we propose a data-driven scheme to initialize the parameters of
a deep neural network. This is in contrast to traditional approaches which
randomly initialize parameters by sampling from transformed standard
distributions. Such methods do not use the training data to produce a more
informed initialization. Our method uses a sequential layer-wise approach where
each layer is initialized using its input activations. The initialization is
cast as an optimization problem where we minimize a combination of encoding and
decoding losses of the input activations, which is further constrained by a
user-defined latent code. The optimization problem is then restructured into
the well-known Sylvester equation, which has fast and efficient gradient-free
solutions. Our data-driven method achieves a boost in performance compared to
random initialization methods, both before start of training and after training
is over. We show that our proposed method is especially effective in few-shot
and fine-tuning settings. We conclude this paper with analyses on time
complexity and the effect of different latent codes on the recognition
performance.</span>

                    <span>Progress in making neural networks more robust against adversarial attacks is
mostly marginal, despite the great efforts of the research community. Moreover,
the robustness evaluation is often imprecise, making it difficult to identify
promising approaches. We analyze the classification decisions of 19 different
state-of-the-art neural networks trained to be robust against adversarial
attacks. Our findings suggest that current untargeted adversarial attacks
induce misclassification towards only a limited amount of different classes.
Additionally, we observe that both over- and under-confidence in model
predictions result in an inaccurate assessment of model robustness. Based on
these observations, we propose a novel loss function for adversarial attacks
that consistently improves attack success rate compared to prior loss functions
for 19 out of 19 analyzed models.</span>

                    <span>Random Forest (RFs) are among the most widely used Machine Learning (ML)
classifiers. Even though RFs are not interpretable, there are no dedicated
non-heuristic approaches for computing explanations of RFs. Moreover, there is
recent work on polynomial algorithms for explaining ML models, including naive
Bayes classifiers. Hence, one question is whether finding explanations of RFs
can be solved in polynomial time. This paper answers this question negatively,
by proving that computing one PI-explanation of an RF is D^P-complete.
Furthermore, the paper proposes a propositional encoding for computing
explanations of RFs, thus enabling finding PI-explanations with a SAT solver.
This contrasts with earlier work on explaining boosted trees (BTs) and neural
networks (NNs), which requires encodings based on SMT/MILP. Experimental
results, obtained on a wide range of publicly available datasets, demontrate
that the proposed SAT-based approach scales to RFs of sizes common in practical
applications. Perhaps more importantly, the experimental results demonstrate
that, for the vast majority of examples considered, the SAT-based approach
proposed in this paper significantly outperforms existing heuristic approaches.</span>

                    <span>Probes are models devised to investigate the encoding of knowledge -- e.g.
syntactic structure -- in contextual representations. Probes are often designed
for simplicity, which has led to restrictions on probe design that may not
allow for the full exploitation of the structure of encoded information; one
such restriction is linearity. We examine the case of a structural probe
(Hewitt and Manning, 2019), which aims to investigate the encoding of syntactic
structure in contextual representations through learning only linear
transformations. By observing that the structural probe learns a metric, we are
able to kernelize it and develop a novel non-linear variant with an identical
number of parameters. We test on 6 languages and find that the radial-basis
function (RBF) kernel, in conjunction with regularization, achieves a
statistically significant improvement over the baseline in all languages --
implying that at least part of the syntactic knowledge is encoded non-linearly.
We conclude by discussing how the RBF kernel resembles BERT&#x27;s self-attention
layers and speculate that this resemblance leads to the RBF-based probe&#x27;s
stronger performance.</span>

                    <span>Sizing and fitting of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is a critical part
of the product creation process; however, traditional methods to do this type
of work can be labor intensive and based on limited or non-representative
anthropomorphic data. In the case of PPE, a poor fit can jeopardize an
individual&#x27;s health and safety. In this paper we present an unsupervised
machine learning algorithm that can identify a representative set of exemplars,
individuals that can be utilized by designers as idealized sizing models. The
algorithm is based around a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a Point-Net
inspired encoder and decoder architecture trained on Human point-cloud data
obtained from the CEASAR dataset. The learned latent space is then clustered to
identify a specified number of sizing groups. We demonstrate this technique on
scans of human faces to provide designers of masks and facial coverings a
reference set of individuals to test existing mask styles.</span>

alter the DNN&#x27;s decision. We propose an attack detector based on

three detection statistics are calculated using the ACGAN Generator and

a principled probabilistic approach to modelling input-dependent, also known as
heteroscedastic, label noise in these datasets. We place a multivariate Normal
distributed latent variable on the final hidden layer of a neural network
classifier. The covariance matrix of this latent variable, models the aleatoric
uncertainty due to label noise. We demonstrate that the learned covariance
structure captures known sources of label noise between semantically similar

other baselines, we show significantly improved accuracy on Imagenet ILSVRC

                    <span>Electroencephalography (EEG) is essential for the diagnosis of epilepsy, but
it requires expertise and experience to identify abnormalities. It is thus
crucial to develop automated models for the detection of abnormal EEGs related
to epilepsy. This paper describes the development of a novel class of compact
and efficient convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting abnormal time
intervals and electrodes in EEGs for epilepsy. The designed model is inspired
by a CNN developed for brain-computer interfacing called multichannel EEGNet
(mEEGNet). Unlike the EEGNet, the proposed model, mEEGNet, has the same number
of electrode inputs and outputs to detect abnormalities. The mEEGNet was
evaluated with a clinical dataset consisting of 29 cases of juvenile and
childhood absence epilepsy labeled by a clinical expert. The labels were given
to paroxysmal discharges visually observed in both ictal (seizure) and
interictal (nonseizure) intervals. Results showed that the mEEGNet detected
abnormal EEGs with the area under the curve, F1-values, and sensitivity
equivalent to or higher than those of existing CNNs. Moreover, the number of
parameters is much smaller than other CNN models. To our knowledge, the dataset
of absence epilepsy validated with machine learning through this research is
the largest in the literature.</span>

                    <span>Knowledge Graphs (KG) and associated Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models
have recently begun to be explored in the context of drug discovery and have
the potential to assist in key challenges such as target identification. In the
drug discovery domain, KGs can be employed as part of a process which can
result in lab-based experiments being performed, or impact on other decisions,
incurring significant time and financial costs and most importantly, ultimately
influencing patient healthcare. For KGE models to have impact in this domain, a
better understanding of not only of performance, but also the various factors
which determine it, is required.

In this study we investigate, over the course of many thousands of
experiments, the predictive performance of five KGE models on two public drug
discovery-oriented KGs. Our goal is not to focus on the best overall model or
configuration, instead we take a deeper look at how performance can be affected
by changes in the training setup, choice of hyperparameters, model parameter
initialisation seed and different splits of the datasets. Our results highlight
that these factors have significant impact on performance and can even affect
the ranking of models. Indeed these factors should be reported along with model
architectures to ensure complete reproducibility and fair comparisons of future
work, and we argue this is critical for the acceptance of use, and impact of
KGEs in a biomedical setting. To aid reproducibility of our own work, we
release all experimentation code.</span>

                    <span>Hyperbolic ordinal embedding (HOE) represents entities as points in
hyperbolic space so that they agree as well as possible with given constraints
in the form of entity i is more similar to entity j than to entity k. It has
been experimentally shown that HOE can obtain representations of hierarchical
data such as a knowledge base and a citation network effectively, owing to
hyperbolic space&#x27;s exponential growth property. However, its theoretical
analysis has been limited to ideal noiseless settings, and its generalization
error in compensation for hyperbolic space&#x27;s exponential representation ability
has not been guaranteed. The difficulty is that existing generalization error
bound derivations for ordinal embedding based on the Gramian matrix do not work
in HOE, since hyperbolic space is not inner-product space. In this paper,
through our novel characterization of HOE with decomposed Lorentz Gramian
matrices, we provide a generalization error bound of HOE for the first time,
which is at most exponential with respect to the embedding space&#x27;s radius. Our
comparison between the bounds of HOE and Euclidean ordinal embedding shows that
HOE&#x27;s generalization error is reasonable as a cost for its exponential
representation ability.</span>

                    <span>Robotic manipulation of cloth remains challenging for robotics due to the
complex dynamics of the cloth, lack of a low-dimensional state representation,
and self-occlusions. In contrast to previous model-based approaches that learn
a pixel-based dynamics model or a compressed latent vector dynamics, we propose
to learn a particle-based dynamics model from a partial point cloud
observation. To overcome the challenges of partial observability, we infer
which visible points are connected on the underlying cloth mesh. We then learn
a dynamics model over this visible connectivity graph. Compared to previous
learning-based approaches, our model poses strong inductive bias with its
particle based representation for learning the underlying cloth physics; it is
invariant to visual features; and the predictions can be more easily
visualized. We show that our method greatly outperforms previous
state-of-the-art model-based and model-free reinforcement learning methods in
simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer where we
deploy the model trained in simulation on a Franka arm and show that the model
can successfully smooth different types of cloth from crumpled configurations.

                    <span>In intelligent transportation system, the key problem of traffic forecasting
is how to extract the periodic temporal dependencies and complex spatial
correlation. Current state-of-the-art methods for traffic flow prediction are
based on graph architectures and sequence learning models, but they do not
fully exploit spatial-temporal dynamic information in traffic system.
Specifically, the temporal dependence of short-range is diluted by recurrent
neural networks, and existing sequence model ignores local spatial information
because the convolution operation uses global average pooling. Besides, there
will be some traffic accidents during the transitions of objects causing
congestion in the real world that trigger increased prediction deviation. To
overcome these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Conv-sequence
Learning (STCL), in which a focused temporal block uses unidirectional
convolution to effectively capture short-term periodic temporal dependence, and
a spatial-temporal fusion module is able to extract the dependencies of both
interactions and decrease the feature dimensions. Moreover, the accidents
features impact on local traffic congestion and position encoding is employed
to detect anomalies in complex traffic situations. We conduct extensive
experiments on large-scale real-world tasks and verify the effectiveness of our
proposed method.</span>

leverage bound propagation techniques and backward recursion to compute lower
bounds for the probability that trajectories of the BNN model reach a given set
of states while avoiding a set of unsafe states. We use the lower bounds in the
context of control and reinforcement learning to provide safety certification
for given control policies, as well as to synthesize control policies that
improve the certification bounds. On a set of benchmarks, we demonstrate that
our framework can be employed to certify policies over BNNs predictions for
problems of more than $10$ dimensions, and to effectively synthesize policies
that significantly increase the lower bound on the satisfaction probability.</span>

                    <span>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained using stochastic gradient
descent (SGD)-based optimizers. Recently, the adaptive moment estimation (Adam)
optimizer has become very popular due to its adaptive momentum, which tackles
the dying gradient problem of SGD. Nevertheless, existing optimizers are still
unable to exploit the optimization curvature information efficiently. This
paper proposes a new AngularGrad optimizer that considers the behavior of the
direction/angle of consecutive gradients. This is the first attempt in the
literature to exploit the gradient angular information apart from its
magnitude. The proposed AngularGrad generates a score to control the step size
based on the gradient angular information of previous iterations. Thus, the
optimization steps become smoother as a more accurate step size of immediate
past gradients is captured through the angular information. Two variants of
AngularGrad are developed based on the use of Tangent or Cosine functions for
computing the gradient angular information. Theoretically, AngularGrad exhibits
the same regret bound as Adam for convergence purposes. Nevertheless, extensive
experiments conducted on benchmark data sets against state-of-the-art methods
reveal a superior performance of AngularGrad. The source code will be made
publicly available at: https://github.com/mhaut/AngularGrad.</span>

                    <span>Recently, unsupervised parsing of syntactic trees has gained considerable
attention. A prototypical approach to such unsupervised parsing employs
reinforcement learning and auto-encoders. However, no mechanism ensures that
the learnt model leverages the well-understood language grammar. We propose an
approach that utilizes very generic linguistic knowledge of the language
present in the form of syntactic rules, thus inducing better syntactic
structures. We introduce a novel formulation that takes advantage of the
syntactic grammar rules and is independent of the base system. We achieve new
state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks datasets, MNLI and WSJ. The source

using deep learning techniques. Unlike standard structures where a single
prediction is made, we adopt encoder-decoder models with sequence-to-sequence
and Attention mechanisms, to generate a forecasting path. Our methods achieve
comparable performance to state-of-art algorithms at short prediction horizons.
Importantly, they outperform when generating predictions over long horizons by
leveraging the multi-horizon setup. Given that encoder-decoder models rely on
recurrent neural layers, they generally suffer from a slow training process. To
remedy this, we experiment with utilising novel hardware, so-called Intelligent

                    <span>The need for reliable systems to determine fingerprint presentation attacks
grows with the rising use of the fingerprint for authentication. This work
presents a new approach to single-class classification for software-based
fingerprint presentation attach detection. The described method utilizes a
Wasserstein GAN to apply transfer learning to a deep convolutional autoencoder.
By doing so, the autoencoder could be pretrained and finetuned on the
LivDet2021 Dermalog sensor dataset with only 1122 bona fide training samples.
Without making use of any presentation attack samples, the model could archive
an average classification error rate of 16.79%. The Wasserstein GAN implemented
to pretrain the autoencoders weights can further be used to generate
realistic-looking artificial fingerprint patches. Extensive testing of
different autoencoder architectures and hyperparameters led to coarse
architectural guidelines as well as multiple implementations which can be
utilized for future work.</span>

                    <span>Covid-19 global pandemic continues to devastate health care systems across
the world. In many countries, the 2nd wave is very severe. Economical and rapid
testing, as well as diagnosis, is urgently needed to control the pandemic. At
present, the Covid-19 testing is costly and time-consuming. Chest X-Ray (CXR)
testing can be the fastest, scalable, and non-invasive method. The existing
methods suffer due to the limited CXR samples available from Covid-19. Thus,
inspired by the limitations of the open-source work in this field, we propose
attention guided contrastive CNN architecture (AC-CovidNet) for Covid-19
detection in CXR images. The proposed method learns the robust and
discriminative features with the help of contrastive loss. Moreover, the
proposed method gives more importance to the infected regions as guided by the
attention mechanism. We compute the sensitivity of the proposed method over the
publicly available Covid-19 dataset. It is observed that the proposed
AC-CovidNet exhibits very promising performance as compared to the existing
methods even with limited training data. It can tackle the bottleneck of CXR
Covid-19 datasets being faced by the researchers. The code used in this paper

taking into account a predefined group of known classes. Real-world problems,
however, may not allow for a full knowledge of the input and label spaces,
making failures in recognition a hazard to deep visual learning. Open set
recognition methods are characterized by the ability to correctly identifying
inputs of known and unknown classes. In this context, we propose GeMOS: simple

pretrained Deep Neural Networks for visual recognition. The GeMOS framework
pairs pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks with generative models for open
set recognition to extract open set scores for each sample, allowing for
failure recognition in object recognition tasks. We conduct a thorough

                    <span>In quantum computing, the variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are well
suited for finding optimal combinations of things in specific applications
ranging from chemistry all the way to finance. The training of VQAs with
gradient descent optimization algorithm has shown a good convergence. At an
early stage, the simulation of variational quantum circuits on noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices suffers from noisy outputs. Just like
classical deep learning, it also suffers from vanishing gradient problems. It
is a realistic goal to study the topology of loss landscape, to visualize the
curvature information and trainability of these circuits in the existence of
vanishing gradients. In this paper, we calculated the Hessian and visualized
the loss landscape of variational quantum classifiers at different points in
parameter space. The curvature information of variational quantum classifiers
(VQC) is interpreted and the loss function&#x27;s convergence is shown. It helps us
better understand the behavior of variational quantum circuits to tackle
optimization problems efficiently. We investigated the variational quantum
classifiers via Hessian on quantum computers, started with a simple 4-bit
parity problem to gain insight into the practical behavior of Hessian, then
thoroughly analyzed the behavior of Hessian&#x27;s eigenvalues on training the
variational quantum classifier for the Diabetes dataset.</span>

                    <span>Human language has been described as a system that makes \textit{use of
finite means to express an unlimited array of thoughts}. Of particular interest
is the aspect of compositionality, whereby, the meaning of a compound language
expression can be deduced from the meaning of its constituent parts. If
artificial agents can develop compositional communication protocols akin to
human language, they can be made to seamlessly generalize to unseen

                    <span>Event detection (ED) aims at detecting event trigger words in sentences and
classifying them into specific event types. In real-world applications, ED
typically does not have sufficient labelled data, thus can be formulated as a
few-shot learning problem. To tackle the issue of low sample diversity in
few-shot ED, we propose a novel knowledge-based few-shot event detection method
which uses a definition-based encoder to introduce external event knowledge as
the knowledge prior of event types. Furthermore, a…</span>

                    <span>Chest X-rays of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are frequently
obtained to determine the extent of lung disease and are a valuable source of
data for creating artificial intelligence models. Most work to date assessing
disease severity on chest imaging has focused on segmenting computed tomography
(CT) images; however, given that CTs are performed much less frequently than
chest X-rays for COVID-19 patients, automated lung lesion segmentation on chest

                    <span>Methods to quantify the complexity of trajectory datasets are still a missing
piece in benchmarking human trajectory prediction models. In order to gain a
better understanding of the complexity of trajectory prediction tasks and
following the intuition, that more complex datasets contain more information,
an approach for quantifying the amount of information contained in a dataset
from a prototype-based dataset representation is proposed. The dataset

                    <span>Joint relation modeling is a curial component in human motion prediction.
Most existing methods tend to design skeletal-based graphs to build the
relations among joints, where local interactions between joint pairs are well
learned. However, the global coordination of all joints, which reflects human
motion&#x27;s balance property, is usually weakened because it is learned from part
to whole progressively and asynchronously. Thus, the final predicted motions
are sometimes unnatural. To tackle this issue, we lear…</span>

communication channel between the controller and the plant can be hijacked by a

from observations, then overrides the controller&#x27;s actuation signal, while
mimicking legitimate operation by providing fictitious sensor readings to the
controller. On the other hand, the controller is on a lookout to detect the
presence of the attacker and tries to enhance the …</span>

                    <span>Optimal transport has been one of the most exciting subjects in mathematics,
starting from the 18th century. As a powerful tool to transport between two
probability measures, optimal transport methods have been reinvigorated
nowadays in a remarkable proliferation of modern data science applications. To
meet the big data challenges, various computational tools have been developed
in the recent decade to accelerate the computation for optimal transport
methods. In this review, we present some cutting-edge com…</span>

                    <span>While programming is one of the most broadly applicable skills in modern
society, modern machine learning models still cannot code solutions to basic
problems. It can be difficult to accurately assess code generation performance,
and there has been surprisingly little work on evaluating code generation in a
way that is both flexible and rigorous. To meet this challenge, we introduce
APPS, a benchmark for code generation. Unlike prior work in more restricted

                    <span>Traditionally, Hawkes processes are used to model time--continuous point
processes with history dependence. Here we propose an extended model where the
self--effects are of both excitatory and inhibitory type and follow a Gaussian
Process. Whereas previous work either relies on a less flexible
parameterization of the model, or requires a large amount of data, our
formulation allows for both a flexible model and learning when data are scarce.
